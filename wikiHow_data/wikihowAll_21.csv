Track your client's progress carefully over time.,
Observe your client and tailor how you track his progress to the way that motivates him most, and the method that best suits his fitness goals.

,
Invite your client to talk about what's bothering him.",How to Address Barriers to Exercise That Clients Experience2," If he feels like he isn't progressing or shows a drop in motivation, show him the records so he can see how much progress he's already made. Ways of keeping track include:


Taking periodic body circumference measurements
Calculating body mass index (BMI) periodically
Using skin-fold calipers or other methods to measure body fat percentage
Weekly, bi-weekly or monthly weigh-ins
Comparing elements of performance, like weight lifted, repetitions done, or duration and intensity of cardiovascular exercise.
Tracking clothing size

,, Ask questions and draw him out until you find what's really at the root of his lack of motivation. If he can address that issue, the motivation may come back naturally.

Adjust the exercise program as necessary so that she doesn't experience excessive soreness after workouts.",How to Address Barriers to Exercise That Clients Experience3," Some soreness is typical, but if it lasts more than a few days, she either overdid it or isn't taking proper care of herself.


Check in to see if she's getting enough nutrient-rich meals, hydration, and sleep.
Be vigilant for symptoms of possible over-training, which include slower recovery, irritability, reduced motivation, decreased performance and altered resting heart rate.

"
Vary your client's training schedule every few weeks to help her avoid the dreaded plateau, when her body isn't sufficiently challenged to adapt further.",How to Address Barriers to Exercise That Clients Experience4," Other techniques that may help include:


Cross training. Encourage her to try new sports or activities; this also helps reduce her risk of overuse injuries, and encourages proper muscular balance.
Test her capacity. Her current routine might not be overloading her enough to stimulate further development.
If weight loss is her goal, have a chat with her about nutrition. No matter how hard she works out, if she's eating more calories than her body needs she could maintain or even gain weight.

Eat healthy.,
Buy new gear.,
Substitute sedentary, unproductive activities with healthy ones.,
Get halfway there.,
Make yourself accountable.,
Read magazines, blogs, and success stories.,
Turn everything off.,
Surround yourself with motivating people.,
Trade weight for cash.",How to Motivate Yourself to Work Out2," If you wanted an article on dieting, you would've pulled up an article on dieting. But the fact of the matter is that everything is intrinsically connected. If you eat healthily, you'll feel healthier. When you feel healthier, guess what? You'll feel more like working out.


In addition to eating healthily, eat breakfast! Not only will it energize you for the entire day, but it'll help you maintain a healthy weight and stay strong.Oh, and chug the water, too!

, Spending money and having nothing to show for it is a pretty crappy feeling. So when you spend triple digits on shoes, pants, and other gear, you gotta use it. So go out and buy a new workout outfit! Part of you will be chomping at the bit to go slink it around the gym.


However, this won't work if you leave it in a bag in your car or bury it at the back of your closet. When you buy that outfit, leave it out. Place it on your dresser, on your bed -- heck, on the kitchen counter -- to torment you until you wear it. Once again, the whole ""out of sight, out of mind"" thing is what you're working on here. Constant reminders will keep you on the right track!

, For instance, make an effort to go to the gym each time you would instead of watching a TV show you don't really like after one you do like. You'll feel motivated to exercise each time the old, deprecated activity comes up in your mind, and not short on time due to the new exercise habit.


How often do we get lazy and do things that we're not particularly engaged in? All. The. Time. Everyone does. So next time you find yourself channel surfing, take it as a cue. You don't have to go to the gym, but get up and go for a walk. Clean the dishes. Organize the garage. Just do something else. You'll feel better (and more productive) after!

, If you want to go to the gym, but just don't feel like it, just drive yourself to gym. Tell yourself that if you still don't feel like working out, you'll go home. Odds are, though, once you're there, you won't feel like driving home. Then tell yourself you'll just walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes, even if your exercise routine involves much more. Just telling yourself to do one more thing, without having to commit to anything else, will make things much easier. And before long, your endorphins will take over.


If your form of exercise involves going outside, a good first step is to get dressed and just sit outside. A good next step is to walk. You'll find that once you're dressed to go and walking, exercise doesn't seem like such a big stretch.

, Even though we're our own worst critics, we also are our own worst enablers. We'll set our minds to one thing on Monday and by Tuesday morning we're onto something else. That's why we've gotta have others holding us accountable, too. Tell your family, friends, and coworkers of your plan -- knowing the questions are coming will surely be motivation to get on it!



Keep a journal. So you've told everyone and their brother about your workout plan -- wonderful! Now it's time to record your progress. You'll want concrete numbers (and you'll want to remember them) to report to yourself and to the world around you. This journal could be on paper, on your computer, or even a blog on the Internet the world can chime in on.

, Though you might think you'd turn green with envy, you'd be surprised -- reading up on the topic at hand may be just the motivation you need. It keeps your mind on working out and shows you just how doable it is. What's more, you'll learn from what you read, resulting in you being more knowledgeable and resourceful.


Reading others' success stories, apart from being heartwarming, will make you think, ""Well, heck, if she can do it, so can I."" And that's exactly how it works -- you see these normal people (just like the rest of us) who took on these marvelous feats and came out ahead. You're next!

, In today's world, you feel naked when you disconnect from technology. How often are you more than 10 feet (3.0Â m) away from your phone? Maybe when you shower, maybe? So turn it off. Turn it all off. What's there left to do? Go for a workout.


That includes the TV, your phone, the computer, the whole gamut of technology. When the time rolls around to work out and you're not feeling it, disconnect. Don't let yourself use these things. You may find that you're bored enough to go for that run!

, The world is full of people that want you to fail. These people are insecure, unhappy, and just plain mean. Avoid them. You know who they are. They'll make this process so much harder to accomplish. They're not worth it.


Working out is such a common thing nowadays. If it's not working out, it's dieting. Nobody is happy with what they look like or their health levels it seems. Use this to your advantage! Do you have a group of coworkers, friends, or family members that are going through the same thing? Suggest you team up! You all can put yours heads together to support each other. After all, there's strength in numbers.

, A 2007 study showed that the more you pay people to lose weight, the more pounds they drop over a three-month period.Doesn't exactly sound like rocket science, huh? If there's someone who keeps nagging you to lose weight, ask that person about paying you for every pound you lose! Odds are they'll pay up or shut up.


If your employer is self-insured, he or she might consider enlisting the services of a company that develops reward programs to encourage employees to lose weight."

Do something small, right now.,
Make it enjoyable.,
Make it doable.,
Make it convenient.,
Get a buddy.,
Go for a quick, but intense, workout.,
Switch it up.",How to Motivate Yourself to Work Out3," Going all the way to the gym, or getting decked out in your jogging gear, or doing whatever it is you feel you should be doing obviously seems like too much work. So just do ten push-ups or jumping jacks. Easy. And usually, it's just enough to get your heart rate going a little bit and make you feel like a little more exercise wouldn't be so bad.


Half the battle may be that working out seems like it just takes so much damn time. Between getting ready, going, working out, showering, getting home, and getting back into your day, hours have just disappeared. But doing small things can be effective, too! Don't write 'em off just because you're not drenched in sweat.

, If someone hands you a book on something you have zero interest in reading, you're gonna glance at the front cover, the back cover, maybe flip through the pages, and set it down to gather dust. So if you hand your body and mind an equivalent workout, don't expect anything different. Do something that you enjoy, will stick to, and want to see through to the end.


This may take readjusting your concept of ""working out."" It's anything that gets you moving! You don't have to go pounding the pavement or asking for a spotter at the gym. Go swimming, go for a walk in the park, take a dance class -- anything. If you like it, do it. It counts!

, Let's stick with the book metaphor. If someone hands you the unabridged, Latin version of the Bible, what would you do? You might be fascinated for a while and tell yourself you're gonna do it(!)...and then two Latin lessons in you decide Oprah's Book Club is more up your alley. Basically, when it comes to working out (and reading), to stay motivated, don't bite off more than you can chew. Make it doable -- make it small.


It's easy to sit on the couch on Sunday evening and say, ""Okay -- I'm starting. I'm running 4 miles (6.4Â km) a day every day until I shed these 20 pounds!"" Yeah. About that. You might be revved up for the first few days, but then you stumble so quickly it's impossible to get back up on the horse. So start with 20 minutes a day. A mile walk. Then, up it as you go. If it's doable, guess what? You can do it. And you will.

, Your favorite author just wrote a new novel that's supposed to be really good -- but it's only available at a store across town, the hours are 1:30-2:00 on Thursdays, and there's no parking lot. Are you gonna get that book? Probably not. Same goes for your workout. If it's inconvenient, it's not gonna happen. Pick one that you can get done that doesn't cut into your day so you get 'er done (or else you'll end up resentful, too).



Pick a gym that makes sense. Even if the best one is 30 minutes away, you'll be better off going to a decent one that's on your way home from work. Alternatively, plan out a routine you can do at home (yoga, anyone?) and fix it into your schedule. When there are no two ways around it, you'll feel obligated to do it.

, This is similar to the ""make yourself accountable"" step. When you have another person depending on you (for a ride, for a partner at the gym, whatever), the guilt of letting that person down forces you to do what you promised you'd do. And since you definitely know at least one person that works out, too, this is an easy resource to tap into.


Okay, so you're not close enough to anyone that you feel is ""on your level?"" Join a class or get a trainer. You'll have the added pressure of getting your money's worth -- many places will still charge you if you skip out.

, Kill the ""I don't have time"" excuse by developing a routine that engages every muscle in your body in just a few minutes. Just because a workout is long doesn't mean it's good and just because a workout is short doesn't mean it's bad. Kill those misconceptions!



Get into interval training. If your schedule is jammed pack, this is the workout for you. If you haven't heard of it, where have you been? High intensity interval training is one of the fastest fat-blasting workouts on the planet (at least right now). You simply alternate between super intense bouts of exercise and rest.The easiest example is 30 seconds full out on the treadmill followed by 20 seconds of rest, but you can do it with weights, too.

, If you've been going for a walk around the same park three times a week for the past 2 1/2 years, you may feel a little bored of your current routine and lose the drive to keep going. Such an easily solvable problem! Do something new! The novelty of a new activity will excite you and keep your brain going.


If you like the idea of sticking to a routine that requires zero weights and zero gym memberships, don't think you have to work these two in. If you're a runner, try running someplace else, running at a different time of day, or concentrating on sprints, a better time, or a better overall distance. You can change your goals, too! As long as you keep your body wondering what the heck is going on, your mind will stay awake, rejuvenated, and motivated.

Understand what hostility is.,
Consider why a person acts hostile.,
Try approaching your hostile coworker.",How to Work With Difficult People1," A coworker is generally considered to be acting hostile when he or she engages in harassment (verbal or sexual), mocking of others, and/or bullying, typically with recurring frequency.Hostility can be intimidating or demoralizing and can make it difficult for others to feel safe in the workplace.;
, Hostility is often a defensive mechanism, employed by someone who feels insecure or jealous, or by someone who rejects others because of some perceived slight. Other times, a person is hostile because of abuse or neglect in his own life. Regardless of your coworker's motivation, understand that below the surface, the problem has nothing to do with you., Often times, effective communication can diffuse a situation, if it is managed early on. Speak calmly and tell your coworker what specific actions or behaviors are problematic, and why. Do not return hostility; rather, let your coworker know how you would like to be treated in a clear, calm manner.Speak with your hostile coworker in private. Hostile people may feel threatened if they are confronted in front of a group of peers.

Do not approach your coworker or try to speak with him about his behavior if you feel threatened. In these cases it may be best to simply speak with a manager or supervisor. Your supervisor should be able to diffuse the situation, and may even refer your coworker to a class, like anger management, that can help him work on his issues.

"
Use TV to help you work out.",How to Motivate Yourself to Work Out4," Pick your favorite show, and make a list of things that happen at least once per episode. Pair each item on your list with an exercise. As you're watching, pause the show and do the exercise every time something on your list happens. Check out some sample games below.

Understand what chronic complaining is.,
Consider why people behave this way.,
Try listening.,
Create a dialogue.",How to Work With Difficult People2," Everyone needs to vent from time to time about stressful or upsetting situations, but some people seem to thrive on complaining. Psychologists call this type of behavior whining--distinct from a complaint because of the nature of the grievance and the person's motivation for voicing that grievance.In other words, there's a difference between voicing concern or frustration about a valid issue, and lamenting with an air of entitlement.

, While casual complaints about common issues like traffic or the weather are normal and can help people bond socially, complaining chronically about every facet of life can be exhausting and demoralizing to listen to. Often times a person engages in chronic complaining because he feels powerless in his work and in his life. That feeling of powerlessness, over time, can become a distinct mindset., It's possible this person just needs to talk to someone about some underlying life issue. Or perhaps this coworker feels lonely and isolated at work, and is attempting to bond with you over frustrations he imagines you share.

, Ask your coworker what he thinks should happen. If your colleague has an issue with someone else at work, encourage your coworker to calmly speak with a supervisor about the issue he is addressing to you.Don't agree with your coworker's complaints, and don't apologize. These reactions will only encourage your coworker to continue complaining on a regular basis.

"
"
Understand what gossip is.,
Avoid sharing personal information with someone who spreads rumors.,
Dismiss gossip in an offhand or humorous way.,
Don't get involved.",How to Work With Difficult People3," Like complaining, gossiping does hold some social value. Throughout history, humans have relied on gossip for safety, using it as a means of learning who is or is not trustworthy.But chronic gossip about other people can be distracting and can damage reputations in the workplace.


Gossip about coworkers can hurt feelings, lower workplace morale, and can even lead to lawsuits for defamation or invasion of privacy.

, If a coworker is known to spread rumors and gossip about others, revealing virtually anything about yourself could give that coworker fuel to start a new rumor.

, If you know that a coworker is spreading gossip about you, or is even lying about you, try using humor to diffuse the situation.Do not confront your coworker with anger. This may lead to escalation or retaliation.
Address the issue your coworker is talking about, but state the facts.
Try saying something like, ""I worry people might think certain things about me, but it's just not true,"" or ""I heard someone say something about that, but it wasn't me.""

, If other people are gossiping about a coworker, it's best not to get involved. And if others are gossiping about you, try not to let it bother you. Chances are they will get bored and move on to some other topic shortly.

"
"
Consider why your coworker might shirk responsibility.,
Speak with your coworker.,
Act like a leader.",How to Work With Difficult People4," Don't get mad or hold a grudge. It's possible your coworker simply has other issues at home that are affecting workplace performance. Perhaps your coworker has some stressful life situation that he or she isn't letting on about.

, Do not be accusatory or mean. Use factual evidence instead of conjecture, and communicate calmly and clearly to your coworker that his or her behavior is affecting others at work., Don't try to get your coworker in trouble, as this could cause hostility or retaliation. Instead, sit down with your coworker and try to help him or her find a more effective strategy to deal with the work that needs to be done."
"
Understand your client's expectations.,
Don't make promises you can't keep.,
Take thorough notes during meetings, and keep all email correspondences.,
Don't lose your patience.",How to Work With Difficult People5," Perhaps there was some kind of miscommunication, and one of you did not realize what the other needed. This can be worked out through calm, direct communication.Try to understand your client on a person-to-person level.
Ask your client, ""What expectations do you have moving forward?""
Follow up with the question, ""What can I do differently?""
If necessary, set reasonable limits on what is or is not acceptable. Again, remain calm and professional, but communicate your concerns.

, The best way to manage your client's expectations is to exceed the promises you've made. You can't do that if you aren't meeting your goals., That way, if an issue arises, you can calmly refer your client back to an earlier conversation.Keep track of dates, details, and what was said by whom.

, Remember that managing your client's expectations is part of your job. Act professional, and take criticism in stride.

Look for a beaded or plastic rope.,
Measure the rope to your height.,
Jump on a waxed or wooden floor.,
Practice a basic jump.,
Jump rope every day for 15-20 minutes.,
Integrate the basic jump into a strength training circuit.",How to Jump Rope for Weight Loss1," Plastic âspeedâ ropes are more durable than cotton ropes and whip around faster, which will create a more intense workout. Theyâre also good for doing advanced jump rope moves, like the single leg jump or the alternate foot jump., Itâs important to use a rope that fits your height. To measure the rope:









Stand in the middle of the rope. The handles should extend to your armpits.
If the handles go past your armpits, cut and adjust the length as necessary.

, This will help to gradually prepare your lower body for the impact of jumping.Donât jump on hard surfaces like concrete, as this can put stress on your knees and lead to injury., Master the form of the basic jump before you try any variations or tricks.








Hold the rope with your hands at hip height and keep your elbows slightly bent. Make sure your upper arms are close to your sides. Roll your shoulders back and down and keep your chest out.
Jump one to two inches off the floor, giving the rope just enough space to slip under your feet. Land on the balls of your feet.
Keep your elbows close to your sides as you turn the rope. The movement should come from your wrists and forearms, not from your shoulders. Make turns that are no bigger than two inches, as any bigger will cause you to jump too high.Make your jumps small and consistent. Do 10-15 jumps to warm up and get the feel for the basic jump.
If you get tired before you finish 15 jumps, drop the rope but keep your arms and legs going. You can work up to using the rope full-time.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basic jump, practice jumping rope once a day. Keep track of how many jumps you can do in 15-20 minutes.








Donât sacrifice form for speed. Make sure you keep your elbows in as you turn and you do not jump higher than one to two inches off the ground., This will help you lose weight and get better at jumping rope. Try a 15 minute circuit, once a day, to burn fat and tone your body. You will need a jump rope, a timer, and an exercise mat.Jump rope for 1 minute, with both feet together.
Do 20 lunges, 10 per side.
Jump rope for 1 minute.
Do 10 pushups.
Jump rope for 1 minute with both feet together.
Do a 30-second plank.
Jump rope for 1 minute. Rest for 10 seconds.
Repeat this circuit one more time, with a one minute rest between each circuit.

Perform as a model employee.,
Communicate with your boss.,
See things from your bossâs perspective.",How to Work for a Tyrant1," By not slipping up and continuing to perform your job duties as perfectly as you can, you leave the tyrant as little room as possible to complain about your work.Be punctual, work accurately, donât call in sick, double-check your work and strive for the companyâs overall good.


Try to anticipate your supervisorâs needs and comply with all requests.
Also give your boss positive reinforcement when they demonstrate successful communication and management. Say something like, âI appreciate you being so accommodating when I had to push my big project back by a few days to take on some new work.â;
, Make an attempt to discuss your feelings with your boss, in a way that can be constructive rather than critical. Practice your key points ahead of time. During the discussion with your boss, remain calm, stay positive and encourage an improved relationship.Express yourself in a way that is non-threatening, not critical and cannot be construed as whining.
Try saying something like, âSometimes I feel as though my work doesnât satisfy you, or itâs consistently inadequate. Is there something I could fix overall, or steps I could take to address this?â
Also bring up points like: âSome of the ways you speak to me and treat me make me feel as though Iâm not a valued member of the office. Is there a way we can focus more on the positive aspects of the work Iâm doing?â

, It may turn out that tyrannical behavior and office mismanagement simply stem from a breakdown of communication. Listen to your boss to gain insight to their side of the story.When communicating with your boss, ask clarifying questions so that you can both be clear about exactly what they expect you to accomplish.
Reminding your boss of all your current responsibilities may help them to realize that some of their demands are overbearing.
Also consider whether your boss's behavior is a product of their cultural background. In some cultures, an overbearing or authoritative posture is considered desirable.

Do side to side jumps.,
Practice alternate foot jumps.,
Try single leg lift jumps.,
Do a 15 minute jump rope routine.",How to Jump Rope for Weight Loss2," Hold the jump rope in the correct position. Jump a few inches to your left as you swing your rope. Then, jump a few inches to your right as you swing the rope. Get into a rhythm as you jump from side to side.Practice 10 side to side jumps, or as many as you can do in one minute.

, Instead of jumping with both feet at once, alternate your feet, as if you are running in place. Keep your knees lifted to the front and try to jump a little higher than 1 inch off the floor. As you land, stay on the balls of your feet.Do 10 alternate foot jumps, or as many as you can do in one minute.

, Begin by jumping only on your right foot. Land softly on the balls of your feet. Then, switch to jumping only on your left foot. Land softly. Keep your shoulders rolled back and your upper body straight as you jump.Continue to do single leg lift jumps, five on each side. Or do as many as you can in one minute.

, Once you feel you are comfortable with these variations, try to put them all together into a jump rope routine that will burn calories and tone your body. You will need a jump rope and a timer.Start with the basic jump, for one minute.
Go into side to side jumps, for one minute.
Do alternate foot jumps, for one minute.
Finish with single leg jumps, for one minute. Switch legs each time you jump.
Repeat this circuit two to three times, with a one minute break between each circuit.
Practice this routine once a day to see improvements.

Keep track of your bossâs tyrannical behavior.,
Rally support from other colleagues or peers.,
Talk to Human Resources (HR).,
Maintain your morale.",How to Work for a Tyrant2," By documenting outrageous outbursts or requests, you have some track record to refer to if youâre ever in a position to defend yourself or to file a complaint against your boss. Keep all emails or memos from your boss which document their overbearing management.


Keep a tape recorder or smartphone handy. No boss likes to have bad behavior on record. Just say, âYou donât mind if I record this so we have an accurate record of whatâs being said, do you?â
If your bossâs tyrannical behavior continues, you can show this list of their behavior to HR or to a senior manager in the company.
Some states require both parties to consent to recording while others do not. Make sure to check the laws in your state if you think you may need to use the recordings for proof of your boss's behavior., It will benefit you to have a support team in the office, and odds are that you are not the only employee who has run across your bossâs tyrannical behavior. Identify other employees who seem to catch the brunt of your bossâs actions and support each other.If you have a mentor at your company, honest discussions with them may help provide support for you during your bossâs reign.However, be cautious about who you choose to confide in about your boss. Some employees looking for the next step up the ladder of success may use your negative comments against you.

, If your bossâs tyrannical, oppressive behavior does not improve and they are not willing to listen to your appeals, itâs time to talk to HR. Give the HR representative a thorough list of your bossâs objectionable behaviors, and see if thereâs any way they can help you.If youâre concerned that HR may not see your side of the problem, explain to them that your bossâs tyrannical behavior cuts down on your productivity and performance.Never tolerate cases of belittlement, sexual harassment, or sexist or racist treatment in the office. Report these incidents to HR immediately.

, Keep a positive attitude and remind yourself that your boss is the one who has the problem. Donât allow your boss dampen your good spirits or make you feel bad about yourself.


Also pass this positivity on to your boss. Flag your successes at work and let your boss know, so they can be aware of your productivity.No boss or job is worth losing mental health or self-esteem over.

Consider if the job is worth keeping.,
Look for work elsewhere.,
Explain your tyrant boss to new employers.",How to Work for a Tyrant3," Regardless of how much you try to work with your tyrannical boss, or document their unfair behavior, at a certain point you may decide that itâs easier to simply leave the office or company.If you enjoy the workplace aside from your tyrant boss, talk to a member of the senior management or HRâit may be possible for you to be transferred to a different position within the same organization. , For your own peace of mind and your own enjoyment in the workplace, it may be a smart decision to consider changing your place of employment. Use your networking contacts to locate similar positions in other companies.


Be discreet during your job search. If your boss discovers that you are searching for a new job, they could make life much more difficult for you.

, This issue will certainly come up in interviews, when you are asked why you quit your previous job, or when youâre asked to explain how you relate to supervisors in the workplace. Rather than getting into details about your former tyrant boss, keep your comments broad and brief.For example, if asked why you left your previous company, simply say, âMy last manager and I had deeply seated disagreements about getting things done at work, and I thought I could best address the situation by moving on.â"

Find out about narcissistic personalities.,
Learn the basic signs.,
Learn what motivates narcissists.",How to Work With a Controlling Person1," Narcissists are pathologically self-centered. They and others with the more extreme Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) lack empathy, crave admiration, and think that they deserve special treatment. They are arrogant to the point of grandiosity. They see their ideas as the best and sometimes only viable ideas, and will strive to protect their egos and status in the organization at whatever cost.Do you have a co-worker who always needs praise or who has unreasonable expectations? Do they inflate their importance and exaggerate their contributions? Do they react angrily to criticism, is easily jealous, and uses others to meet goals? These traits are all related to narcissism, and to other behavioral disorders like antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personalities. There are many good web resources about narcissists and how to deal with them.


See the Mayo Clinicâs website http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/basics/definition/con-20025568 for an overview. Try visiting Psychology Today at https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201408/8-ways-handle-narcissist for some basic tips about identifying and handling a narcissistic personality.;
, Because they are so self-centered and lack empathy, narcissists and control-freaks commonly display behaviors that you should be able to identify. Does your co-worker listen? A narcissist rarely does or belittles opinions because, to them, your concerns are veiled criticisms. Are they quick to blame? A narcissist is unwilling to accept responsibility for the reason, again, that it would imply a criticism; they instead blame others. Narcissists are also apt to bully, especially those they see as weak, a threat, or someone who has criticized them. Keep in mind that your co-worker may conceal their dark side, coming off as charming and generous. In fact, charm may be the reason why they have succeeded in their job and in hiding their bullying from managers.It is important to know that narcissists are not always purely destructive. They can bring positive qualities to a workplace. For example, they tend to be passionate about âtheirâ projects; they can be strong leaders and be highly self-motivated; and they can be great at jobs in PR, marketing, social media, or other outreach., Narcissists are usually of two types: insecure or grandiose. It may be hard to tell from outward behavior, but narcissists often harbor deep-seated doubts and feelings of shame, fear, and paranoia. This sense of vulnerability can lead them to lash out when crossed and to swing from arrogance to extreme self-pity.But while vulnerable types care about how they are viewed, other narcissists are self-confident to the point of delusion and see themselves as infallible. Unlike âvulnerableâ narcissists, âgrandioseâ narcissists are not making up for feelings of inadequacy but simply acting out their expectations. They truly believe they are superior and rate highly in manipulation and psychopathy (i.e. lack of remorse and empathy). More apt to meet criticism with rage or to seek revenge, they are in some ways the more dangerous sort."

If you're not sure whether something is too casual, assume that it is and dress up your outfit.",How to Dress for a Human Resources Job," Some of these basics might include black trousers or slacks, a solid-colored skirt, a dark blazer or jacket or a white button-down shirt. When in doubt about your outfit, incorporating one or more of these professional basics will polish your look.;
, Keep ear piercings simple, take out any facial or tongue piercings and cover tattoos with long sleeves or pants when you're dressing for work in human resources

, Remember that you're representing your company and keep your makeup understated and attractive. Your makeup can be unique as long as it's still professional. If you want to add more color, try adding it in moderation, like wearing colorful eyeshadow but skipping the bold lipstick.

, Avoid skirts with high slits or shirts with see-through material, as these might show too much skin or be too provocative for the workplace.

, A meeting with high-level international executives probably calls for a suit and jewelry, whereas a meeting with a small, grassroots or nonprofit group would allow you to dress more business casual.

, Being familiar with the expected dress code will help you choose clothing that meets your company's expectations for employee appearance.

, It's better to be a little overdressed or look more professional than necessary than to look overly casual or unprofessional.

When you understand it, it is easier to control and respond to. For example, one definition of anger explains it as an emotion that can vary in intensity. You may see someone a bit irritated, and that is a form of low-intensity anger. It can escalate all the way up to all-out rage, and this is what you want to avoid in the workplace.Anger has a physiological response of increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and increase in adrenaline.
The fight-or-flight response people get when they are angry or encounter it in others is accompanied by adrenaline, which prepares your body to move. This is a reason why people can become so aggressive and lose control of managing their anger.;
, There are actually people who physically have a lower frustration level than others. This can be due to genetic predisposition, or it can be related to the social climate that one is raised in., Keep in mind that anger is often a cover-up for other feelings, usually feelings of vulnerability. As humans, we usually feel something else just before we get angry, and that is the real emotion. Anger is just where we turn to express ourselves. We can feel scared, humiliated, or rejected beneath our anger.Try to figure out if one of these negative emotions is the real reason your boss keeps getting angry. Understanding their anger may help you have more patience and a lowered stress level (i.e., if you figure out that isnât because your projects are always late or low quality).

, This is because anger is a natural response when we feel threatened. When you feel threatened, you need to take actionâsometimes a fighting action, which is what adrenaline prepares us for. When people have anger management issues, it means they do not have good boundaries with expressing their anger.There are three ways that most people deal with anger: to express it, to suppress it, and to calm it. When you do choose to express anger, it should be in a controlled, assertive way that clearly communicates your feelings without hurting anyone.
People with anger management issues often forget that they can also choose to suppress or calm their anger instead of express it.

, Sometimes anger can become violent. Your boss can be out of control. If you begin to feel uncomfortable or unsafe, leave the room immediately and find help., It is also useful to figure out the reason your boss is angry. Although if your boss is yelling or lecturing someone the reason may be obvious, it may not be so easy to figure out why your boss is suddenly acting passive-aggressive.


Ask questions to get to the root of the reason.
Listen closely to what your boss is saying. If they are using sarcasm, what is it they are being sarcastic about?

, Find a solution to your bossâs anger. They may be so worked up with expressing their anger that they may have forgotten to even look for one. Be the employee who solves the problem, whether you are at fault or not, such as gathering other co-workers together and brainstorming how to approach a big client without having to be instructed to do so, or offering to help the employee who made the error your boss is mad about.


If you are at fault, apologize for what you have done. Encourage others who might genuinely have caused problems to do the same.

, Another strategy you can employ to keep from becoming entangled in someoneâs angry rant is to become emotionally distant. You can start to give simple or one-word answers, stop smiling, and become unemotional. Lowering your responsiveness may be just what an angry boss needs in order to calm down.


This is not the same thing as the ""turtle"" response to anger, which is when you shut down and avoid anger in an unhealthy way. It is important that you become emotionally distant out of a desire to calm down someone who is becoming aggressive, instead of out of fear.

, When youâre faced with an angry boss and a tense work situation, it is easy to feel defensive and angry yourself. But expressing this anger can make the situation worse. If your boss is already mad at you, it can push them to an even deeper anger. If they are mad at someone else, it can turn the anger on you. To help calm your boss down, refrain from becoming defensive.Pause before responding quietly. This allows you to slow the situation down so he can cool off.
Donât raise your voice or respond in like kind. Do the opposite. If your boss is screaming, talk in a low voice. If your boss is ignoring you, keep talking to them like they arenât.
Donât make excuses for your actions if they have contributed to your bossâs upset. Owning what you have done can sap the strength from an anger storm, whereas getting defensive can fuel it., Not only can a calm response to an upset action diffuse the situation, it means that you are staying in control. Use calming techniques such as a lowered tone of voice or speaking slowly to help get the point across that calmness is the appropriate response.Body language can also diffuse a situation. Maintain non-threatening poses, like doing the opposite of a defensive stance such as wide gestures and keeping your arms uncrossed.Wide gestures and open arms also demonstrate that you are not trying to threaten anyone, making you a calming influence in an angry moment.

, Keep understanding and empathy in your reaction to an angry outburst. Donât be condescending or self-righteous, but do express a genuine desire to find out what is wrong. This type of reaction requires humility, and many times humility can diffuse a volatile situation.Humility and empathy show that you are willing to learn and make up for your mistakes, which may be all your boss is looking for.
To stay humble, you could say, ""I'm sorry--I totally didn't see that mistake! I'll go fix it right away."" And to stay empathetic, you could say, ""I can understand that."" Make sure to keep irritation and other negative emotions out of your tone of voice.

, Another strategy for diffusing a situation of anger is to distract the angry person. Maybe you hand your boss the assignment that they are fuming about being late.


Studies find that thinking about the reason we are angry can increase our feelings of anger, while not thinking about them can decrease those feelings.If your boss appears to be thinking about the reason they are angry, change the subject.

, Even if youâre not in a tense moment, you can practice diffusing the anger of your boss by roleplaying with co-workers, diffusing the anger of others, and practicing asserting yourself with people who are less intimidating.

, When working for someone with anger problems, you want to do your part to keep angry outbursts to a minimum. Part of this is understanding how you react to anger. Your level of comfort with othersâ expressions of anger is largely dictated by the way anger was handled as you grew up. You will probably have one of four responses, and this knowledge can help you improve your response to anger in the workplace.Turtle: turning inward and being emotionally distant until the anger passes
Cornered Rat: you push back in irritation by yelling and nagging
Ostrich: in complete denial that anger is present
Chicken: run away as fast as you can

, None of those four responses to anger is very healthy, so developing a personal expression of anger that is regulated by maturity is important if you want to lower stress levels around a boss with a temper. You need to be able to take responsibility when you are in the wrong and to express your anger (when it is truly justified) directly with a civil demeanor.Your response should focus on de-escalating the tension, rather than adding fire to the flames.


Such a mature response can diffuse an anger situation with your boss.
This regulation of your anger can inspire your boss to do the same.
Instead of reacting without thinking, take a moment (count to 10 and take a deep breath), and consider what your response will do to your boss.
Consider what factors contributed to their anger and address them in your response. Think about why their anger is specifically directed at you and not another worker.
If your boss speaks harshly about a mistake you made, for example, you could explain your actions in a calm voice and an apologetic manner instead of defending yourself in the same tone of voice as your boss.

, If your boss gets triggered and has an anger episode, donât allow them to degrade you. In these moments, you should respond by guarding your self-esteem. Acknowledge only what is true in what your boss says, and recognize when they are exaggerating out of a negative place of anger.Donât take your bossâs anger personally. Recognize your negative self-talk and consider what actually happened. Ask yourself questions like, what did I actually do to contribute to this problem?, Take responsibility for your reaction to your bossâs anger. Donât blame them for your reaction, even if you feel that you wouldnât have had to feel negative emotions without their anger., It may be tempting to gossip about the situation with co-workers or post about it on social media, but this may damage you or your bossâs reputation. Too many employees unthinkingly show their feelings on social media, often turning a mole hill into a mountain. You should never even consider posting about this event on social media.

, Talking to others isnât just a good way to process your negative emotions, itâs also a way to gain perspective on your work situation. Your company may have a staff member who helps mediate conflict, or if you really canât find anyone to confide in, visit Human Resources (HR) to see if they can find you someone to talk to.


A trusted friend or counselor in your private life can let you vent your emotions and then give you perspective on how to handle the anger problems of your boss.
If your boss is being unreasonable and causing you an inordinate amount of stress no matter what you do to manage it on your own, these people that you confide in may be able to tell you that they see this happening. Gaining perspective on this may help you know if you should look for a different job.
Make sure that whoever you tell will not tell anyone else. You may need to refrain from using real names so that they are unable to share details on what you say. Even if you do, know that your secret may not be kept.

, If you work closely with your boss, you may be wondering if there is anything you can do to mitigate their anger on a daily basis. One suggestion is to use the LIFE acronym to help you be a positive listener and responder when your boss becomes angry.L = Listen to your angry boss rather than arguing with them. When they ask you to respond, reflect back to them what they have said, making sure there is no sarcasm in your tone of voice.
I = âIâ statements are useful to keep from further antagonizing an angry boss, instead of âyouâ statements. âYouâ statements feel accusatory, making tensions rise rather than fall. Refrain from blaming, criticizing, and judging. A ""you"" statement might sound like, ""You made me feel angry,"" but the ""I"" statement counterpart for this might sound like, ""I felt angry because of the situation.""
F = Freedom to express themselves is important. Give your boss the green light to vent and do not try to give advice unless they directly ask for it.
E = Everyone is a winner is an attitude that can help get your boss out of an angry rant and back into a calm mindset. Maintain this attitude, which encourages giving others the benefit of the doubt.

, Not all angry bosses are going to scream and shout. A passive-aggressive response can be just as intense, and is actually more common in the workplace. If your boss tends to sulk, obsess, tell hurtful jokes, ignore others, or have an angry, sarcastic smile, your boss may have a problem with passive-aggressive anger. You should recognize these behaviors and employ the usual tactics for dealing with anger in the workplace.In some cases, it is better to ignore a level of unpleasantness unless it is directed to a specific person. Unfortunately, many bosses run departments through intimidation, rather than leadership.
Other signs of passive-aggressive behavior include general sarcasm, being secretive, setting up employees for failure, spreading rumors, pretending not to hear employees, and being distant and unengaged.
One strategy for dealing with passive-aggressive anger is to put yourself in their shoes and imagine why they might be angry. Ask other co-workers to find out if they have been getting the same passive-aggressive treatment, such as the cold shoulder. You might find that they are just overwhelmed, in which case you could offer to take some work off their plate.

, When you see your boss reacting out of anger, especially if it is directed toward you, think about their anger in terms different than you are accustomed to. Negative thinking will make your attitude negative, which doesnât encourage productivity in the workplace. Instead, reframe your thoughts into positive statements.Instead of rolling your eyes and muttering about how irritating your bossâs short fuse is, say to yourself, âItâs so sad that he is always upset. What can I (or âweâ if youâre on a work team) do to help him?â

, This is a very sensitive area as many bosses do not care about your hurt feelings, just getting the job done. Communicating your feelings may create the sense that you are weak and can't handle the job. If you need comforting and understanding, go to people outside work or the HR Department, knowing that a formal complaint to the latter may result in termination or transfer for the boss or the complainant.

, In order to leave the stress of your bossâs anger problems at work instead of bringing them home with you, you may need to start some de-stressing rituals on the way home from work or after you get home. Things like hitting the gym on your way home, aromatherapy, and having someone at home to talk to about it can lower your stress level and keep work stress from ruining your home life.Relaxation and stress-relief activities can also keep your own anger at bay.
You can also try relaxing breathing techniques and imagery methods to change your focus from being on negative things to being on positive things.

Consider whether adequate time was provided to the team.,
Look at the goals and objectives the team worked under.,
Ask the team members if they felt that the work they undertook was worthwhile.,
Look to the team leader.,
Consider what feedback was given.,
Consider whether the team was given credit for the work it did.,
Look at team members individually.,
Consider the resources.",How to Troubleshoot Team Failure," If insufficient time was given to complete a project or other effort where everyone had to pull together, the looming deadline may have caused many team members to crumble, give up or presume that someone else would manage it since they couldn't do so personally. Always ensure that there is sufficient time and be sure to review this at regular intervals during the life of the project or other purpose of the teamwork.


Time is also an enemy of the team structure itself. If you don't allow sufficient time to build the right team and to weed out those members who aren't clicking adequately, then the team probably won't cohere and will not succeed.;
, If these were inadequate or unclear, there is a major reason why the team didn't perform well. It is vital to explain everything at its most basic and to allow for question and answer sessions through the life of the team's work. Never assume that team members have understood what is expected of them or what the outcome needs to be. Keep checking on understandings and if refinements are made during the life of the project, double check on understandings.

, A common reason for failure as a team is that the team gets the notion that what it's doing is not worth it, is reinventing what already exists or isn't going to get used whatever they do. Any sense of pointlessness in the work being performed will destroy team spirit very quickly.

, Was this person trusted, respected and listened to by the team? While team members don't need to like the leader, they do need to be motivated by this person and the leader needs to be someone who inspires confidence and a willingness to follow instructions given. The team leader is an important aspect of team success and failure to be accepted by team members is often fatal to the team's effectiveness.


Another aspect is to ask if the team leader was competent in performing the role of leading the team. Even if they were liked, they may have simply not understood what was expected of them in the way of leading, guiding and motivating the team.

, All people perform better when given regular, decent feedback about what they're doing. A team is no different and it is important to praise both the team as a whole and individual members. Letting others in the organization that this team is valuable is important for boosting morale; without doing so, the team may feel it hasn't been adequately recognized or appreciated and this can sow the seeds of dissent.


This doesn't mean just positive feedback. It means both positive and negative feedback, namely any feedback at all! How do people know they need to make changes or that they're on track without feedback? Be sure the team is being told regularly how it is perceived as doing.

, Related to praise, if the credit due to the team's efforts was assumed by someone else or by the organization as a whole rather than being attributed to the team and its individual members, the morale can dip for future endeavors and the team will lose its motivation. There will be a sense of ""why bother since someone else gets all the glory?"" if the credit isn't attributed properly.

, Sometimes team members sabotage one another for reasons of their own, or internal bickering, competitiveness or territoriality can take over and spoil what could have been a cohesive team. Try to spot such ""rotten eggs"" within a good bunch as early as possible and move them elsewhere so that the team can get on with its work without being undermined.

, Was the team given adequate resources to complete the work needed? Were the resources given on time and in the right amounts needed? If the team had to work by the smell of an oily rag and found it difficult to make ends meet, it will be evident in failed results.

Plan ahead.,
Watch what you say.,
Stroke their ego while guiding them.,
Do not expect to please them.,
Put things in writing.",How to Work With a Controlling Person2," If you have reason to think that a difficult business client is a narcissist, try to plan ahead in your dealings with them. It is important to avoid openly argument or disagreement. This will only make them angry or, worse, lead them to turn on or undermine you. Try instead to anticipate. Imagine what sort of demands they might spring. This will allow you to be prepared upfront without having to enter a confrontation or give ground, both of which, in view of narcissistsâ inability to empathize, could be disastrous for your business relationship.

, Choose your words carefully. A narcissist will read criticism into very innocuous comments, resulting in a tantrum or a potentially damaging, unprofessional display. Tread lightly around a controlling business partner or client, knowing that the least word could set them off. You might not have a choice about dealing with a client, and your job may depend on getting along with them.


Literally watch what you say, as well: take down the minutes of your meetings and telephone calls. Communicate very clearly about your project, timetables, and your clientâs expectations. This will give you support in case they make new demands or accuse you of breaking an agreement., Controlling people are often perfectionists; some of them, like Steve Jobs, are indeed visionaries.In a business situation it may be best to play to your controlling clientâs narcissistic tendencies. Stroke their ego without being servile. For example, lead them to think that your ideas and suggestions are really their own. Try to finesse them to a desired end rather than being goaded into an argument.

, The perfectionism of a controlling client will make it difficult to please. Expect constant demands on your time and to hear that your work is not good enough. Do not be surprised if the client tries to threaten or bully you or to accuse you of mismanagement. Challenging a narcissist will get you nowhere because, to them, they are always right and you are always wrong. By the same token, however, do not show hesitation or weakness. If you must, gently hold your ground and insist upon your initial agreement, using notes as back up., You may have to spend a good deal of your time and resources on a controlling client. They will feel entitled to it and put demands on you. Make the project easier by putting things in writing if you can, at the beginning, including your rate of pay and how much time you can reasonably expect to devote to the project. Be gentle but firm. You have other clients to serve. Insist also on a by-the-hour rate rather than flat-rate payment. This will give you some protection from your clientâs exorbitant demands, and at the very least will mean that you wonât end up working free overtime."
"
Avoid, avoid, avoid.,
Stand up without being confrontational.,
Protect yourself from sabotage.,
Talk to your superior.",How to Work With a Controlling Person3," An obvious tactic is to avoid your co-worker if and when possible. Eat elsewhere if they take their lunch in the break-room. If they work in a cubicle by one restroom, use the other restroom. This method is not a cure-all, particularly for small offices. Even so, refuse to be entangled if you are forced to interact. If your co-worker asks you to do something outside of the office, politely decline. If they denigrates an office mate, excuse yourself and go back to work. They may eventually lose interest.], As said before, a narcissist will react poorly to a direct challenge and may even turn the situation against you. Learn to assert yourself without provoking a reaction. If your co-worker makes an unreasonable demand, for example, say that you will think about their suggestion and consider if you can comply â that way, you have not committed yourself. If they try to dragoon you into an extra project, tell them that you would really like to help but are working against your own tight deadlines. Repeat yourself in a calm, controlled voice, the unspoken point being that you will not be bullied or intimidated.

, Some narcissists claim disproportionate credit in the workplace or even try to steal recognition, minimizing your input. Be prepared for this sort of behavior. Protect your ideas. Record the work that you are doing and do not freely share details with your co-worker. Keep copies of all your notes and documents. Save your work online or on your computer so that it is time-stamped. Keep records of your interactions, as well, saving emails or jotting them down in a notebook â e.g. ``Monday the 1st: came late to meeting and disparaged my report.`` At the same time, communicate with your boss. Check in regularly so that they will know what you are doing and how you are specifically contributing to the workplace.Keep a look out for signs that you are being undermined, as well. Cold behavior from your boss, hostility from formerly friendly colleagues, or any sudden change in normal behavior could signal that your co-worker is quietly sabotaging you., Bringing the problem to the attention of your boss could be risky. Some bosses would rather not be bothered with interpersonal problems or will see you as difficult, ânot a team player.â They may also be under the spell of the narcissistâs charm, or your co-worker might try to turn the complaint against you. Be professional, calm, and constructive if you decide on this route. If you can, frame the issue so that it is about the workplace rather than you individually and present it in positive rather than negative terms â e.g. âimproving office moraleâ rather than âmy control-freak co-worker.â Bring documentation that supports your version of events. Your boss will be more likely to believe you if you can produce proof and if they see your professional handling of the situation. Asking for a transfer to a different department is another option, if a last resort.

"

Plan ahead.,
Watch what you say.,
Do not compete.,
Have an escape plan.",How to Work With a Controlling Person4," Like a business client, you probably cannot afford to cross your boss openly. Try to anticipate them, instead. Do they have a habit of shortening your deadlines? Recognize this and adjust project timelines accordingly. Imagine their likely demands and be as prepared for them as you can, avoiding a situation where you might be forced to object or give ground.

, Again like a business client, be very careful of what you say in front of a narcissistic boss. Do not openly criticize or challenge them. Narcissists cannot take criticism and you will find yourself the target of their anger or, worse, out of a job. It may be to your advantage to stroke their ego or even to take the blame when something goes wrong. Whether you do so is your choice. After all, you are in subordinate position and must deal with their traits somehow.At the same time, set limits on extreme behavior. A narcissistic boss will encroach on your boundaries and expect you to cater to their every whim. Be gentle and matter-of-fact: you will respond to their 2 a.m. calls or emails in the morning, not immediately. You will be in touch again as soon as your vacation ends.If you want to speak up, do so carefully. Schedule a private meeting. Tell your boss all the things that you appreciate about them, and then make specific and constructive suggestions. Frame the issue so that it is about the workplace as a whole and not a personal complaint about them., A narcissistic boss becomes dangerous if they see you as a threat. Let them make the decisions. Follow directions to the letter and present your ideas as if they were their own, while being very specific about their expectations. Follow up and let them know how you are progressing on the task. But do not expect that good results will lead them to reward you or even treat you better. To a narcissistic boss good work is a result of their managerial skill, not your industry. You cannot win and would do better not to play the game. At the same time, however, you should not overtly complain or underperform. This too could provoke your bossâ ire., Working for an overly controlling boss is taxing, exhausting, and stressful. You cannot expect such a personality type to change â in fact, narcissists rarely seek treatment for their behavior. Have an escape plan if you can. Look for jobs elsewhere and send out applications. Do this very discreetly, as your boss might interpret it as an act of disloyalty or even, if they are paranoid, a personal attack. Narcissists are not loyal but often expect utter loyalty in others.Protect yourself until something concrete comes up. Tell only those you really trust about your search. There is no need to be dishonest but also no need to say too much. If you have to leave the office for an interview, tell your boss you have a âpersonal appointment.â Having a plan in place will give you peace of mind."

Control your actions and reactions.,
Approach this situation as an opportunity for self-growth.,
Separate yourself from the negativity.,
Improve your surroundings.,
Treat your time away from work as sacred.",How to Survive a Hostile Work Environment1," While you canât control the way your coworkers or supervisors behave, you do have power over your own actions and responses. You donât want to emulate the bad behavior or negativity exhibited by the people around you.If you start to feel upset, don't lash out. Instead, take a break and a deep breath.
Think about something positive outside of work that will help get you through the workday.
Act professionally and with integrity
Continue to perform the job you are being paid to do to the best of your abilities.
A supervisor or another company will likely find your admirable behavior under difficult circumstances impressive.;
, Although it can be difficult to identify positive aspects of a hostile work environment, viewing your work situation with the goal of learning important lessons can help you cope.For example, are there specific leadership qualities this experience is teaching you about?
Is there something you do on a daily basis that makes you feel proud?

, If you feel yourself getting frustrated or depressed, itâs a good idea to try to take a few moments and escape the negativity. Here are a few suggestions:Take short breaks outside.
If you canât leave the office, walk around inside the building.
Wear headphones, if permitted, and listen to music or something you find relaxing.

, When you are dealing with a hostile and unpredictable work environment, it can help you feel more calm and in control to improve your surroundings.De-clutter and organize your workspace.
Bring a family picture, a plant, or something to remind you of home.
Post quotes that you find positive or encouraging on your desk or walls.
The changes you make do not have to be drastic or extreme.

, Try not to spend your time away from work worrying about what is occurring at the office or what might occur when you return. This will provide you with some much-needed time to unwind and distance yourself from the negative environment.When you are not at work or on the clock, avoid checking work-related emails and voicemails.
Although it might seem therapeutic to vent about work with friends or family, don't use all of your free time rehashing what occurred during the day.

Give time and understand the psyche of your colleagues and seniors.,
Be nice and cordial to all.,
Devise new ways of approaching issues.,
Be genuine as much as possible.,
To change the system is not possible and not needed/ necessary.,
Have a lower benchmark.,
Learn to play Chess â¦ yes â¦ itâs a mind game â¦ and fits in well with the office politics!,
Know when to speak, where to speak and with whom to speak.,
Practice patience.,
Learn tact.",How to Survive Office Politics," It is important to understand the people you are working with: to know what motivates them, what they do outside the organisation, what do they aspire to be, and their view of the organisation.


No one is going to give this kind of information to you on a platter. You have to be careful, tactful and above all you have to be a good listener. Everyone wants to be heard. If you can just listen to people, within a short span of time you will develop their confidence in you. Becoming a confidante is the best possible thing in any set up, personal or professional.
Listen and only listen (this is more important if you are a new employee) and if there is something that you do not agree with keep it to yourself - no need to spell it out and try to make the person change his or her opinion. This goes for all you colleagues and your seniors. Listen to them, see what drives them and then make an opinion. If you understand the people then it is easier to deal with them.;
, This is more true for bigger organisations/offices, as you donât know when and whom you might have to work with! Whereas in smaller offices, the groups once established doesnât get changed often and hence less/no issues.


So be nice to people. It will help in working and also in getting information, in knowing whatâs happening all around, the office politics etc. Being nice does not mean that you have to be the ever smiling or the flattering types. Make sure that you disagree and put across your opinion/point also for otherwise you may be taken for granted.
If you are consistent and always stand for a certain group of things, people around you will understand and start respecting it too. There is no need to show disagreement unless it is a do or die situation which is usually an illusion.

, Out of box thinking always helps most of all in dealing with human resources. Now in general if people are professional then they are expected to behave in a particular manner and at least do as expected and spelled out in their job description.


The problem arises when they donât want to do that and behave badly. Usually itâs not just a single person but a group of people who behave this way. All of them have the same attitude and the same alibi for not working â they have been in the system for long and know how it works!
It is here that one needs to devise innovative ways to approach them and get the work done and that too without disturbing the balance or encroaching on their seniority, in terms of years/experience or snob attitude! In simple layman's terms getting work done, without getting sidelined, by interfering in the office power games.
First of all be clear, what is it that you want them to do. Spell it out clearly, then figure out how much authority do you have over the people. If you are not their boss, donât worry, there still are ways! Once the task is clear, talk to them directly. Present the task in such a way that it looks like you are asking for their help. You can even go to the extent of showing your inability in doing it on your own. Then ask them if they could help in looking it over and giving their input. In most cases this approach works!
Simply because it doesnât look like you are bossing around â¦ and the other person feels important, nice that you are asking them for help â¦ that their opinion matters. It doesnât look like you are making them work â¦ so they are happy and your work gets done. The reason is simple â there are a large number of people who donât want to work when asked â¦ but will work when work is not put across as work! (Just like small children) And donât forget that all the time you have to be nice and well meaning. At any point it should not look like you are being cunning â¦or selfish â¦ which brings to the next point â¦

, While practicing any of the above, the one thing that you have to ensure is that you should come across as a genuine person. In fact you should not just come out as that but also be a genuine person. Now I know itâs not easy to be genuine while listening to someoneâs tails of treachery/cunning ways or someoneâs cribbing session! (I mean you will be genuine but in another direction!) So in that case, as have mentioned earlier also, donât speak your mind â¦ be silent â¦ which is still genuine â¦ for you neither agree nor disagree. Also be humane and more accepting of other people â¦ try to not to judge people and the result would be a more genuine/ empathetic you. It is a quality that will help always and it is only this that will bring you closer to people in any set up. So be naturally concerned and helpful without going overboard.

, Please understand and realise that systems are so because they were meant to be so â¦ and they are serving their reason and aim â¦ one person can not change and should not aim to change the system. So rest your oars â¦ be true to yourself and your values and leave the organisation if you find the system and its practices a burden on yourself. Easier said than done â¦ but there is no other way.

, There is a limit to everything and then there is a saturation point. So the moment the red light of your conscious starts glowing â¦ give it up â¦ there are other places to work. For if you continue cribbing and also continue working then the day is not far when the benchmark will cease to exist and you will join the bandwagon of people who have no self esteem and who just exist.

, If you know how to play chess you would know how to be prepared for at least the next two steps of your opponent and in your office everyone is your opponent unless you have won them over and even in that case you should be careful and never let your guard down! Chess helps in thinking and gauging what should be your next step and from where all/ who all you need to protect your assets/skills/information â¦ who is out to hit you etc. The game of Chess teaches this and much more â¦ take these as lessons for life and not just for the game!

, If only what you speak reaches wrong ears, the repercussions could be as fatal as losing your job. Need I say more? Well so the thing is that, choose your confidante carefully and refrain from making hard hitting comments against a colleague or organisation in front of people who may use it to their benefit. For most of the time people try to rise by pulling others down â¦ if only they would aim at rising at their own with their own skills/competencies/knowledge!

, There is no alternative. The more patient you become the less is the stress and the happier your disposition.

, Itâs a prerequisite in all that you do â¦ and itâs an end result of all thatâs discussed in previous points. No one can teach how to be tactful but everyone needs to learn it to be successful and happy!

Stay away from gossip.,
Perform tasks that are a result of conflict resolution.",How to Stay Positive in a Negative Work Situation," When you are confronted with a conflict at work, whether directed toward you, a coworker, or your team in general, itâs important to stay calm. This will help you evaluate the situation in order to make the wisest decisions possible.


Quickly perform any routines you have in place for relaxing under pressure, such as taking a deep breath or counting to ten. If you donât have any, learn some.Try walking away instead of speaking.
Once youâve walked away, use your five senses to calm down.For example, you could keep soothing aromatherapy at your desk in the form of a candle or bottle of essential oil.;
, If you resist the negative situation you are facing at work, this will only increase your internal conflict. Such resistance will more than likely force you into a negative reaction, which will escalate the conflict. Instead, accept what is happening around you.If a negative situation at work is ongoing, accepting the situation will help you face the problem and get it resolved, rather than letting it drag out and become a constant burden. , In the middle of a negative interchange, itâs tempting to feel badly about yourself. This negative feeling can make you defensive, causing a negative response. Focus on what you are good at until the exchange has ended.


Think about a project you recently worked on that you got praised for.
Think about all the classes you took or experience you have on your resume qualifying you for your position.

, Be kind instead of responding the same way the negative person is behaving. If someone is being aggressive, it is best to diffuse this tension by being passive in the moment.Resist the temptation to fight back. Being defensive in the moment will quickly escalate a negative situation.
Try to say things that avoid confrontation. You could say something like, ""I was not aware of the error,"" or ""I apologize for any confusion my actions may have caused.""

, Refuse to engage anyone who comes at you with an accusation. Staying calm and quiet, apologizing even when you donât believe it is your fault, can keep you out of the entanglement of a conflict in the moment. You can deal with the realityâif you didnât do somethingâafter the heat of the moment has passed.


Offering a neutral point of view, whether youâre involved in a conflict or are hearing about someone elseâs, can be a calming agent.Offering a neutral point of view can mean that you don't take sides; instead, you agree that both parties could be right, and neither is justified until evidence proves otherwise.

, This gives you time to think about what youâre going to say, and makes you appear confident. Speaking slowly also makes you look purposeful and precise, contributing to an air of confidence.


Appearing confidentânot arrogantâin the midst of a personal attack may prevent the accusing party from going too far in their negativity.

, If a coworker or supervisor is accusing you of a misstep, readily confess your part of the issue. Humility like this can quickly diffuse a volatile situation.


If you feel that you did no wrong, donât be arrogant or defensive about this fact. Be open to the idea that you might have done what they are accusing you of, and offer to try to find the cause of the error.
Some ways to respond with humility might be to defer to the superior person's experience or to admit you are not as skilled as you thought you were in the area in question.

, If you are facing a negative situation which you have contributed to (intentionally or not), admit your error. As said in the part above this one, humility can quickly diffuse a volatile situation.


Admission of error will also make the other party more disposed to reaching a peaceful resolution.

, If nothing you have tried is workingâapologizing, staying calm, keeping out of the conflictâit may be best to walk away. If you back away slowly, this might be easier for the other party to take than if you just turn on your heel and stomp away.


This may be hard to do, especially if someone is wrongfully accusing you or calls you a coward, but to avoid escalating the conflict, you may need to leave the room.
This does not make you a coward. Initially, what this does is allow you and the opposing party time to cool down and rationally decide a course of action. In the workplace, this is usually the most desired result.

, If you are in an ongoing negative situation, or are friends with someone who is, it can be tempting to snub, even provoke, the offending party. However, to minimize negative situations and interactions, treat all coworkers equally and with professionalism.


Treating everyone professionally prevents playing favorites, a situation that can cause further reason for tensions to rise.
Donât avoid interacting with a coworker because of a recent or ongoing conflict. Determine to treat them professionally, and you may find that the conflict minimizes on its own.

, Itâs important to maintain a positive attitude both during and after a negative situation at work, especially if a conflict becomes ongoing. Keep yourself encouraged by telling yourself what you are good at.


Remind yourself of the things you do well at work. Keep encouraging emails and notes from bosses and coworkers and look over them.
Donât bully yourself by telling yourself âI should haveâ¦â and donât expect too much from yourself., Think about similar negative situations you have encountered in the past. Try to remember what you did then in order to stay positive, and apply it here and now.


For example, you may have made a mistake on a document you turned in to your boss, which is similar to a mistake you have made on a document you gave to your supervisor. How did you repair the first error? Repair it this time the same way.

, After an initial conflict, it is helpful to make lists of positive things about your job or the specific task in question.Take out this list of âgood thingsâ whenever you are temped to become angry, and choose to be thankful for them.


Being thankful will help you change your perception from negative to positive.

, Distract yourself from wanting to retaliate in the moment by thinking about things that make you happy (your family, the beach, etc.). Keeping in mind people and situations that would be affected by your outburst may also keep you from losing your temper.


You can also choose to generally improve your attitude by interpreting everything in a positive light.For example, you can accept a compliment for its face value instead of wondering what you could have done to make the person say even more, or wondering why they havenât said anything before.

, Thinking about happy things means you need to keep negative thinking at bay. To do this, arrest negative thoughts and ask yourself if they are true, and consider different explanation when you are tempted to think the worst of workplace communications (or lack of them).

Focus on things that are within your power to perform, not on things out of your control.In general, people who maintain positive thinking tend to live longer., If you are the one in the middle of a conflict, you may want to seek wise counsel for how to handle the situation. This may be your boss, supervisor, or even a long-standing coworker. The point is to find someone who will give you positive advice instead of focusing on the negative.


If no one in your department can give objective advice, you may want to reach out to a trusted friend in another department, or even Human Resources (HR).

, Stay away from discussing the conflict with coworkers who like to gossip. These people will tend to focus on the negative aspects and spread your perspective around to others, making the conflict worse.


By the same token, if you are being a sounding board for someone elseâs conflict, choose not to gossip yourself. Commit yourself to confidentiality and encourage the person to confront their conflicting party in person., Finally, to show your willingness to cooperate, do what is asked of you as a result of the conflict. Being a compliant employee and coworker makes everything work more smoothly.


If you are ever asked to do something that makes you uncomfortable, speak up. Tell someone who has authority, like your boss or HR.

Research company policies.,
Follow company procedures to address workplace grievances.,
Document your claims.,
Ask for assistance.",How to Survive a Hostile Work Environment2," Most companies have specific guidelines about harassment, discrimination, and inappropriate workplace behavior and etiquette. Itâs a good idea to review these policies so that you can evaluate whether they are being followed.

, Review employee handbooks or training manuals to see if your employer provides specific instructions for addressing workplace grievances. If these are in place, document your efforts to conform to these procedures.


Evidence that you followed these instructions strengthens your case in the event that you have to seek the help of higher-up employees or outside assistance.

, If you have to address the issue of a hostile workplace environment with supervisors, human resources, union representatives, or attorneys, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your concerns.Save relevant emails and written correspondence.
Take notes during meetings and phone conversations.
Keep a log or diary detailing the date, time, and circumstance of specific encounters or incidents.
Work with other affected or involved employees to draft statements and reports detailing grievances or incidents that occur.
Keep the records you collect in a secure place where coworkers or supervisors wonât have access.

, Donât be afraid to ask for help from a colleague, a supervisor, or a member of human resources. They can provide valuable information and advice on how to improve the workplace environment.


Coworkers you approach might feel the same way, and talking with them about the situation will help everyone feel less alone.
While it might feel daunting to contact supervisors and human resources staff about a hostile work environment, it's their responsibility to address employee concerns and resolve problems that have a negative impact on employee productivity and the work environment.

"
"
Identify co-workers who might feel similarly.,
Discuss the workplace environment.,
Work together to generate solutions.,
Form a united front.",How to Survive a Hostile Work Environment3," Hostile work environments usually have a negative impact on more than one person, so it is likely that some of your coworkers feel the same way.


Think about colleagues who have mentioned encountering similar behavior.
Are their colleagues who have been present during the same situations you experienced.

, Talking with coworkers who have similar concerns helps you feel less isolated.


Itâs a good idea to have these conversations outside of the workplace so you are not behaving unprofessionally, and supervisors cannot claim you are wasting work time.
Although it might be tempting to share your frustrations with a colleague, remain professional and donât resort to name-calling. This will undermine your case.

, Your coworkers might have helpful insights and good ideas to resolve the situation.


For example, is a coworker on good terms with a supervisor or human resources staff member who might be able to help or offer advice?
If multiple employees have a problem with a supervisor's behavior, agree on a way that everyone should respond. This will send a consistent message to the supervisor that their behavior is unacceptable.
Focus on identifying some of the main concerns shared by employees, but also discuss specific solutions to resolve these problems.

, If you decide to take more formal action to improve a hostile work environment, forming a united front will be more impressive to supervisors and company management. Multiple employees working together to resolve these issues will be more effective than one person making a complaint or stating a grievance. Here are a few suggestions for group actions you might consider taking:


Write a letter addressing the groupâs concerns about the work environment, and ask coworkers interested in participating to sign.
Organize a group meeting with management or human resources to articulate concerns.
Compile records that support and document the groupâs concerns.
If your company or workplace is associated with a union, consider making a group presentation to members.

"
"
Talk with your supervisor.,
Meet with human resources personnel.,
Ask to be reassigned or relocated.,
Send a letter from an attorney.,
File a hostile work environment claim.,
Leave your position.",How to Survive a Hostile Work Environment4," If previous attempts to deal with a hostile work environment have failed or you feel the situation is too serious to wait, set up a time to meet with your boss and discuss your concerns. To demonstrate that you are a team player and not a problem employee, try to address these issues in a way that is positive and diplomatic.


Donât place blame or sound petty.
Instead, recommend concrete steps you would like supervisors to make to address your concerns and improve the workplace environment.
If you feel like your boss is responsible for the hostile work environment, it might be a good idea to talk with human resources personnel in your office or company.

, A human resources employee or representative can serve as a mediator and help resolve the workplace issues.


Remember, itâs to your benefit if you express your concerns in a calm manner and do not place blame.
Provide the documentation you've collected to support your claims.

, If you feel that a change of department, supervisor, or branch might improve your work situation and productivity, talk with human resources about this option. A small change like this could make a significant difference in your situation.Requesting the change in writing also serves as an important piece of documentation that you are trying to be proactive and resolve your situation in a professional manner.

, Meet with an attorney to discuss your concerns and ask them to send a letter articulating your grievances to your boss, a human resources manager, and the companyâs legal department. Since many companies do not want to deal with potentially costly lawsuits or negative publicity, they might work harder to correct the problems and address your concerns about the work environment.

, If the letter from an attorney does not result in the changes you had hoped or you would prefer to file the lawsuit, meet with the attorney to explore the possibility of filing a hostile work environment lawsuit. To qualify for a claim, you need to prove the issues you encountered or observed at work were not isolated incidents, but rather occurred regularly, were intentional, and interfered with your ability to work.If the problem behavior constituted harassment, particularly sexual harassment, you do not have to demonstrate that it occurred regularly.Federal laws define harassment as unwelcome conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, or genetic information.A licensed attorney will be able to help you determine if your workplace or work situation qualifies as being hostile from a legal standpoint.

, If attempts to resolve these issues are unsuccessful and you feel that remaining in your position is no longer an option, it might be time to move on. Find a company that respects its employees and creates a more welcoming environment that is conducive to productive work.It can be empowering and productive to begin networking and researching alternative career options or positions ahead of time."

Before you can examine your issues related to your challenges, you need to understand exactly what your workplace challenges are. Talk to your counselor about your work and what problems you have every day. Your counselor will be able to help you pinpoint exactly what your challenges may be. These challenges may include:Harassment or bullying from coworkers or bosses
Conflicts with coworkers
Gossip being spread about you at work
Communication problems between you and those at work
Workplace discrimination
Performance issues from you or your coworkers
Low job satisfaction
Poor fit between your skills and job
Lack of job motivation;
, Once you know what your workplace challenges are, you need to figure out exactly what you are feeling about the challenges at work. Talk to your counselor about your challenges and work with him or her to find out exactly how you feel about these challenges. If you are not truthful with yourself about how you are feeling, you won't be able to work through your challenges.Once you figure out what these emotions are, you will need to work with your counselor to learn how to accept them.


For example, if you do not feel motivated to do your job most days, perhaps you are feeling unfulfilled or bored with your work.
If you don't accept your feelings, you will likely have additional problems later. Plus, you will not be able to work with your counselor to work through your workplace challenges if you are not truthful and accepting of your feelings.
This may not be easy to do. Before you can even approach a counselor for help, you need to know what you need help with., If you suffer from extensive workplace challenges, you may have underlying issues that have resulted from your unhappiness at work. Common issues include mental issues such as depression and anxiety, or physical issues, such as hypertension or insomnia.Your counselor can help you identify some of these conditions, but you may need to see your primary care physician for help as well.


For example, if you suffer from depression, then you would need to talk to your therapist about that, but you might also consider talking to your physician or seeing a psychiatrist to discuss medication options.
If you have additional mental health issues, ask your counselor to incorporate treatment for these conditions into your session. You will need to work on your workplace issues first to help lessen the resulting mental health issues.
Additional physical issues should be checked out by your physician.

, Counseling will not provide a quick fix for your problems in the workplace. It will take time and work.If you hope to get over your workplace challenges, you need to commit to working with your counselor to change. If you don't treat the counseling as an integral part of the healing process, you will be much less likely to be able to move past your problems.


This means you need to be honest with your counselor, do what he or she tells you to do, and do everything possible to improve your situation.
For example, if your counselor asks you to journal about how you feel before and after you go to work each day, then make sure that you do so.

, If your stress stems directly from your workplace challenges, you may be able to get access to a therapist through your job. This is a common issue, which means that many workplaces provide counseling help to deal with workplace issues. There are multiple kinds of counselors that are used by employers. Employers provide help through:Vocational counseling, who work with issues related to job performance, satisfaction, and fit.
Industrial and organizational psychology, which helps with human behavior within the workplace and works on creating a healthy, collaborative workplace.
Professional counselors through employee assistance programs (EAP), which is a no cost counselor location service that provides help for work related challenges.

, When you face challenges at work, you will likely not be happy at your job. This may cause you to have thought patterns that get in the way of the way you do your job. Talk to your counselor about how to change your thought patterns. Your counselor can give you ways to change your thought patterns throughout the day..


Negative thoughts about your work can cause additional challenges at work in addition to the challenges you are already dealing with.
For example, if you constantly dread going to work because you are not satisfied with your job or feel underappreciated, you may begin to think negatively about your job, which can cause you to do poor work or be less productive than before.
If this happens, ask your counselor to teach you some ways to focus on the contributions you do make to your job instead of how unhappy you are.

, If you feel undervalued or unhappy at work for any number of reasons, you may begin to slack off. This means that you may stop fulfilling your responsibilities or fall behind in your tasks. If you see this happening, talk to your counselor about how to find motivation within yourself. Your counselor can help you come up with motivational phrases or internal confidence to help with your issues.For example, you could ask your counselor to teach you some personal mantras to keep yourself motivated, discuss ways to set goals for yourself every day, or rehearse ways to tell your coworker your goals so you are accountable to someone else.
This will help you work past workplace issues and still get your job done.

, Work with your counselor to learn how to track your emotions. Your counselor may tell you to keep a diary or write down the different ways you feel and react each day. You can see how various emotions you experience throughout the day can affect different aspects of your work performance. You can then work with your counselor to come up with ways to shift your emotions or deal with them so they don't affect your job.Your counselor may advise you to take note of the different emotions that contribute to or are caused by the challenges you have at work.
Make sure that you are writing your emotions down as directed so you can discuss them with your counselor later.
This will help you determine how to deal with the emotions that contribute to challenges at work as well as the ones caused by challenges at work you cannot change.

, When you are around other people at work, try to keep your emotions out of your interactions. If you know you are an emotional person or respond to situations in emotional ways, ask your counselor to help you learn different ways to channel your emotions into other outlets or shift your emotions away from the surface while you are at work. Your counselor can help you learn to keep a level head instead of letting your emotions decide how you react. If you allow your emotions to rule how you are at work, you can cause more challenges for yourself at work.


If you are dealing with discrimination, bullying, or other outside challenges that may cause an emotional response, work with your counselor to figure out how to remain professional until your specific challenges are handled., When you are dealing with workplace challenges, you will likely be more stressed than normal. Talk to your counselor about the best ways for you to reduce the stress levels in your life. Your counselor will have insights into how to approach stressful situations with a calmer, more focused mind. Your counselor can also work with you to find ways to reduce your stress outside of work as well.


This can be a combination of breathing exercises, meditation, mental and physical relaxation techniques, and regular exercise.
It may take a while, but find what works best for you to help lower your stress levels.

, If you have problems at work with your coworkers, try to work on your communication skills. Work with your counselor to find better ways to express yourself, work past personal hang ups that inhibit communication, or any social anxiety that may contribute to an inability to properly communicate at work.


This can help you relate better to those around you, which can help you tell your coworkers about issues you are having with them, ask for help with your job duties you are unsure about, or express your dissatisfaction with how your job is going., One of the ways you can improve your work environment and work through challenges is to be more assertive. Use your counseling sessions to come up with ways to get past personal insecurities that hold you back from being more assertive. Ask your counselor to help you find of root of your job insecurities and help you move past them so you can be more confident and assertive every day.


If you are being bullied, discriminated against, or are unhappy with your job, tell your superiors so they can help with these issues. They may not even know this is happening.If you have people who work under you that are not doing their jobs, be more assertive with them as well. They will not feel accountable until you tell them what you expect of them.

, If your workplace challenges stem from having too much to do or not being qualified to do certain jobs, learn to delegate tasks to others.This may be hard at first, especially if you like having control over things at work. Talk to your counselor about why you feel the need to always be in control and how you can be more comfortable letting go of that control.


However, letting go of some of the responsibility at work can help you and your coworkers' lives run more smoothly.

, A great way to work through interpersonal challenges at work is through conflict resolution. This can help reduce stress and tension between you and a coworker. Work with your counselor on how you should approach this resolution. This may mean working through the hurt caused by the conflict as well as learning to let go any lingering anger.


You should approach this with an open mind and a positive attitude in order to get past the challenges the conflict causes at work.
If you are not able to come to a resolution, work with your counselor to figure out a way to deal with and move past the continued conflict at work.If your employer supplies you with the counselor, he or she may be able to sit in on the conflict resolution in order to help.

, If you are having problems getting tasks done at work, make a list of your tasks every day with the most urgent at the top. If all of your tasks are not urgent, do the unpleasant ones first. This will get them over with early so you can save the more enjoyable one later.If you are having a hard time getting to the point where you can do this, talk to your counselor about why this might be and what may be holding you back from doing your best every day. Your counselors may also be able to help you come up with the best strategies for you to do that.


This may require you get organized as well. This can take effort and work, but it will be worth it. "

Find a favorite local band.",How to Survive a Co Op Session in Indianapolis," Days are boring. You will be given some interesting tasks, but on the whole, we all know you are here for the money. Many tasks you will be given will be long, drawn out, boring, and seemingly useless, you have to get through these. Updating hundreds of part routings because someone in upper management decides to use ""Ref:"" instead of ""Per"" will be monotonous to say the least, but if it is on your PDR, you had better get it done (See PDR below).;
, Bring snacks to work: Snacks keep your blood-sugar up, and providing they are healthy, will not affect your diet very much. Good snacks include raisins, peanuts, pretzels, trail mix, chex mix, fruits & veggies. Also be sure to offer whatever you are munching on to coworkers, as it will increase their respect for you, and they will share their snacks in return. Be sure to accompany your snacks with frequent trips to the watercooler. This gives you a nice short break, and allows you to stretch your legs, plus, it allows for frequent trips to the bathroom as well. Finally, visit other coops often, as they can sympathize with you, and are generally decent to chat with. Ohh, and did I mention the internet?

, Co-Op's love to go out to lunch with each other everyday, but planning can be cumbersome at best. It is best for a leader to make a decision, and then everyone can go, or not. For the health nuts, you can still pack a lunch, and just go along for the break from lunch and the company, two great things.

, First, you get to go out and get hammered (see below) when you get off of work, that is a huge plus. Second, you are more likely to get better ratings from your boss, which translates to more money when you graduate. Third, as much as I hate to admit it, it does make the day fly by if you keep busy with work. Finally, it will remove any possible feeling of guilt that might crop up later if you just mess around the whole time.

, It helps to give each day of the week a name, and some suggested ones are listed below in tips. Naming each day gives you something to look forward to, and helps with motivation. Also, it makes planning easier, as who is going to forget a day like Wasted Wednesday?

, The more butt-sitting you do then, the more you will be willing to do later at night, which might end all hope of a good night. Try cooking a dinner for everyone, or playing a sport. Soccer is always fun, and friends will kick balls into your back really hard. Or you can try basketball, and you might sprain your ankle and be forced to hang out with cool people for another day. Or, play the official Co-op Sport: Footy! Aussie Footy! Amazing to say the least. Or, you can just go home and work out every day, see tips below.

, If you have a large group, trying to organize where you are going at 10pm on a Tuesday when you all have to be up at 6am the next day is not fun, and easily leads to bitter arguments and name-calling. Have some people act as leaders, and during work that day, send out some feeler emails stating where you are going, and inviting others to come along. ""Group-Think"" should ensure that everyone will go along with your plans, as long as they are varied from night to night.

, Bars/Night clubs are generally boring for the first few hours of the night, especially if you get there at 8pm when they open. If the place is closer, you can afford staying out a bit later, and have cheaper cab rides, or even better, talk someone into being a designated driver (DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE! YOU MIGHT SPILL YOUR BEER! ).

, Drinking at a bar is fun, and it is easy to get carried away, making for a long, horribly boring, and even painful day at work the next day. Planning ahead will help keep you in check, and makes going to the bar every night easier on your budget as well. If you are planning on getting tanked, be sure to drink plenty ahead of time, as $10 will get you loaded at home, but will only buy a few beers at the bar.

, It is fun to go to 80's night here and there, but every night and it is going to start dragging. Mix it up, try an Irish Pub, or some yuppie place downtown. This also gives you a better variety of the opposite sex should you be inclined to meet new people.

, Wheelhouse is really good, and they play in a few different locations, giving you new experiences, and putting long term dates on your calendar, helping the days go by faster. This also helps you from hating this mediocre ""city"" (closer to a town!). Also, local bands attract the younger crowd, something that is at times illusive here, as there is no large college here.

Having a plan of action with your life, and knowing where you are going, is often the best place to start feeling positive.;
, Everyone gets started at a different place and heads on their own journey. You have no idea where others' journeys can get them to. Blindly making a comparison leads to wasting time and feeling negative. You can only control your own thoughts and destiny, so work on that.

, The point is getting to know and focusing on something important to you, such as the economy, your market, actions that others may take. That's to say: your inner ideas and your actions.

, More than making yourself a happier person, self-mocking can also make you powerful, influential, and attractive. Having a sense of humor helps put setbacks in perspective and reminds you that you have a life outside of your job.

, This feeling is a parasite that can nibble up your energy and well-being. You can take actions to make a change when you are not satisfied with this world. But sitting and complain accomplishes little other than getting a complaint off your chest. This can actually be a helpful way to put problems in perspective, but only if you don't overdo it. Save the sobs stories, say what is on your mind, and move on to more productive thoughts.

, Smiling is proven to release chemicals in your brain that make you happy, even if the smile is forced. That said, you should take the time to enjoy as much of your work as possible. Give yourself time to talk to coworkers you like, watch a few funny videos during lunch, and listen to music that makes you happy. Thinking positive leads to positive thinking, not the other way around.

, Being kind to a coworker ensures that you will get kindness back. There may be days when people are stressed, including you, but knowing that you have the support and friendship of those around you is a great way to let off some steam and feel more positive. Humans are social animals, so don't neglect to build relationships with your coworkers.

, Focus on the ""can do"" rather than ""cannot"" of situations. A great way to start is by looking at problems as opportunities rather than failures. Change begins with vision, and vision only begins to become a reality when it is said out loud. You need to discuss problems and failures with an eye towards self-improvement, not chiding yourself for past mistakes. Bad times happen at every office, and staying positive is not about avoiding problems, but growing from them.

Gather as much information as possible.,
Identify the parties involved.,
Pinpoint the ethical issues involved.,
Review the company's standard procedure.,
List and evaluate your options.,
Execute the best option.,
Keep a record as you monitor the outcome.,
Take things to the next level when needed.",How to Solve Ethical Issues1," Before taking action to solve an ethical issue, you need to have as thorough an understanding of that issue as possible. The problem may not be as straightforward as it first appears.Ask yourself if you really know enough information to determine what's going on. Ideally, you should gather all relevant facts concerning the issue at hand, but if you cannot collect all the facts, you at least need to know enough to make a well-educated hypothesis.
You also need to ask yourself if you might be making assumptions. Everyone has their own personal and professional biases. Some of those biases are grounded in experience, but if you aren't careful, they could be skewing your perspective and making you see something that doesn't actually exist.;
, Determine who else in the company is involved in this issue. Involvement can be direct or indirect.


On a direct level, those participating in the ethical violation are certainly involved.
On an indirect level, those who will be impacted regardless of having no say in the issue are also involved. Among others, this can include coworkers, customers, and stockholders.
You'll also need to determine who, among those involved, will be your allies. Since fixing this issue goes beyond the limits of your power, you will need the support, assistance, and direction of others when solving it. That being the case, knowing who you can trust is a very important matter.

, Instead of settling for a general sense that something is wrong, you need to ask yourself which ethical principles are being abused.


Some ethical violations are more obvious than others. For instance, if you caught a coworker stealing expensive equipment, you could make the clear distinction that theft is wrong. In situations dealing with small violations or interdepartmental strife, though, the violation may not be as clear.
Review the circumstances again and ask yourself which fundamental principle is affected. Possible options include violations of power, integrity, honesty, objectivity, professional competence, confidentiality, or fairness.

, Find out if your company currently has an internal system set up for dealing with ethical issues like this.


If you have a company manual or similar documentation, review it now. Look into the organization's policies concerning workplace ethics.
Pay close attention to the chain of command. Find out who you should involve at which points, and the correct procedure for doing so.
If the company doesn't have a set structure for dealing with ethical issues, you will need to determine who to go to using your own experience and understanding.

, Think of every possible option available to you instead of settling for the most obvious. Write out each of these options and consider the impact each one might have.When evaluating your options, consider how each one fares in the light of your company's internal procedures, any external laws involved, and any general ethical values upheld by society as a whole.
Predict the consequences that will result from each option. This includes both positive and negative outcomes. Understand that, in some circumstances, each option may come with both negative and positive consequences.

, After reviewing all of your options, determine which is best and put it into practice.


In most cases, the solution will require you to escalate the issue to an authority within the company. The correct person may depend upon who within the company is guilty of the violation. Moreover, if the highest authorities in the company are guilty, you may need to bring the violation to the attention of an external authority.
The best option should address the ethical issue in a productive manner. If multiple ethical values are involved, your solution should usually correct as many violations as possible.
Whatever option you choose, be prepared to stand by it. There will always be critics, and there is no guarantee that you can remain anonymous throughout the entire corrective process.

, Unfortunately, your work doesn't end just because you've reported the issue. Keep an eye on how things progress to make sure that the issue is genuinely addressed.


As a general rule, it's a good idea to document nearly everything in writing. This includes your own investigations, the reports you've filed, and the discussions you've had concerning this issue. You may need to use these written records to defend yourself later.

, If the initial solution you implement doesn't work, keep trying. Continue through the hierarchy until you've exhausted every possibility.


Don't be afraid of going above someone's head if he or she isn't getting the job done. Be reasonable when evaluating how that supervisor has handled things, but don't let yourself be bullied into submission by someone trying to sweep things under the rug.

Think about how you can add to your work.,
Know your limits at work.,
Personalize your workspace.,
Make sure you take care of your body with food and water.,
Stay organized but flexible.,
Be active.,
Daydream more.,
Separate work from play.",How to Stay Positive at Work2," What unique skills, perspectives, or ideas can you use to make your workplace even better. Take some initiative for your work, personalizing it and letting you do the jobs that you love the most. Having a stake in your company's goals and mission will make your work much easier to attach with relish.


These goals can be personal too. Even if you don't love the company you work for, taking initiative is a great way to improve your skills and resume for the next job.

, If you know that a project is going to cause you undue stress, for whatever reason, don't take it. This doesn't mean that you should do the bare minimum of work, it simply means you need to put your own needs before the needs of your company. Don't take extra work just because you are asked -- make sure that it is work you want to do and can handle without hurting your quality of life.

, Put up pictures, bring in a nice set of headphones and music, and place some knick-knacks around your desk. Do your best to make the space yours, not some bland office where you come to work.

, Simply eating enough food and drinking enough water may be the best way to stay positive at work. Feeling hungry or thirsty will lead to tiredness, and that drained feeling will bring you down day in and day out.

, Let yourself plan, but don't feel chained down by a schedule. Instead, use organization to avoid last minute deadlines, to keep everything where it should be, put your affairs in order. A clean, uncluttered mind starts with an uncluttered desk and calendar, so take some time to clean up your life.


That said, the ability to roll with the punches is important to maintain a positive outlook. Plans will change, and that's fine -- you just need to change with them.
Cross off tasks and events as you accomplish them.

, Get up and move around at least once an hour. Sitting in the same place all day can quickly become tedious, but staying active helps you feel better all day long. Take a walk on your lunch break, bike to and from work a few times a week, or try working out before your shift. When your body feels good, your mind feels good, and exercise is the best way to make it happen.

, Let your mind wander from time to time. This isn't just good for your mental health -- it can even make you more productive. The argument that daydreaming facilitates with your work can date back to the 20th century. You can get a unique and competitive insight when you roam your mind.

, Sometimes your work seems incredibly important in your world. You're killing a part of yourself, however, when you let your work nibble your privacy and integrity. Work is for work, not home, so learn to distance yourself. When you leave the office or sign off online, work is over. Move on to other, more enjoyable experiences.


Have an interest/hobby unconnected with your job. This is the part of your life that is totally unrelated to work - and should not include co-workers or work acquaintances. If you play golf, don't play with your workmates - unless it's a work-related event.

Objectively review the report.,
Perform your own investigation.,
Identify all involved parties.,
Identify the ethical issues involved.,
Brainstorm possible solutions.,
Ask for external support.,
Meet with the affected parties.,
Implement any necessary educational programs.",How to Solve Ethical Issues2," When an employee you supervise brings an ethical issue to your attention, you have the moral and professional obligation to hear what that employee has to say.


If the employee explains the issue to you verbally, request a formal written report. The additional paperwork might seem like a pain, but it should help protect everyone involved, including both you and the whistle-blower.
Do not allow your personal and professional relationships with the involved parties affect your judgment. You may think well of the person being reported and poorly of the person doing the reporting, and your instinct might be right when all is said and done. Until you straighten things out, though, you need to treat the complaint as potentially valid and act accordingly.

, After receiving the initial report, you need to collect all of the facts from scratch. Don't take anything for granted.


Talk with other employees who might have information to share. Review written reports, computer records, and security footage associated that may shed light on the issue.
If your company has a department dedicated to addressing matters like these, make sure that the department is informed. You'll need to work directly with that department during the investigation.

, Ask yourself which people are directly involved and which are indirectly affected. You will need to concern yourself with both groups when taking corrective action.


From your perspective, the parties directly involved will include both the employee who reported the issue and the employee or employees mentioned in the report.
Parties indirectly affected can include other employees, other supervisors, customers, stockholders, and more. Even though these persons have no control over the issue, you will still need to keep their needs and standpoint in mind.

, Draw a definite conclusion on which ethical principles have been violated. In some instances, there might be more than one principle involved.


If your investigation proved the initial report true, you'll need to evaluate the actions of those reported. Possible ethical violations could include, among others, violations of power, respect, honesty, professional competence, or integrity.
If your investigation proved the initial report false, you need to evaluate the actions of the reporter. Ask yourself if the report was made in honest error or if the reporter violated the ethics of honesty and respect by making false accusations.

, Think of different ways to solve the ethical violations committed. Keep in mind that solutions need to address both short-term and long-term needs.


Evaluate your options based on how well they actually address the issue and how well they fit into any internal procedures already established by the company.
Try to predict any consequences that will result from each of your options. Consequences can be good, bad, or a mixture of both. When choosing which option or options you'll implement, choose those that have the greatest positive consequences and least significant negative consequences.

, Depending on the overall nature of the issue, you might need to ask for support within the company or outside of the company.


Support within the company can come from your own supervisor (when applicable), human resources, or other departments you work with closely.
Support from outside the company can come in the form of ethics experts. Lawyers and legal authoritiesâlike the policeâmay need to be contacted if the ethics violation was also illegal, but for less severe matters, an ethics expert might be a counselor or adviser., Short-term solutions will usually require you to sit down with the parties directly involved. Depending on the circumstances, you may need to meet with each party separately or meet with them together in conference.


When an ethics violation was reported in confidence by an external party, you will need to meet separately to protect the identify of the reporting party.
If the violation itself involved multiple conflicting parties, you may need to sit down with all parties in conflict at the same time.
Take appropriate disciplinary measures. Those who violated an ethical principle should be disciplined for it. Make sure that the consequence fits the severity of the violation, though.
Offer counseling and support. If the incident caused trauma or other difficulties to one or more parties, find out from them what sort of support they need to heal.

, Oftentimes, ongoing ethical issues or those that affected a large group of people will result in the implementation of ethics training.


The specifics will vary from situation to situation, but overall, you should aim to make sure that each current and new employee is aware of the ethical issue and how it should be handled.

"
"
Consider the setting.,
Identify the problem.,
Collect information.,
Consider issues of accountability.,
Identify who has power in the situation.,
Use the resources that are available to you.,
Evaluate your options.,
Put your plan into action.",How to Solve Ethical Issues3," Different settings might be governed by slightly different guidelines, even though the overall process will usually be fairly similar.


Ethical issues involving minors often happen at school, but they can also occur within churches, community centers, or even just in the neighborhood.
The role played by the minor may also determine how the ethical issue must be handled within the setting it occurs in.

, Figure out what the problem is and what ethical issues it brings up. Try to define it on both an intellectual and emotional level.


Ethical violations that also break laws or institutional regulations are usually easy to identify, but for issues that don't strictly violate such guidelines, you may need to think a little more deeply.
If your only response is an emotional one, you might not be able to get the issue resolved. You need to be able to clearly and intellectually define why the issue violates some ethical principle (honesty, responsibility, respect, etc.).

, Gather as much data about the circumstances and applicable regulations as possible. Issues involving minors can be particularly sensitive, so you need to be remarkably thorough.


Identify all parties involved. Try to find out exactly what happened, gathering as much evidence as you can in the process.
Also gather data about applicable regulations from various governing sources, including professional organizations and government at the federal, state, and local level.

, You'll need to determine how accountable the involved minors and adults are in this situation.Regarding minors, accountability needs to be assessed at both legal and personal levels. Involved minors might not be legally responsible for certain actions even though they are responsible for others. When no laws were violated, some minors may not be accountable for various aspects of the situation based on their age or level of development.
Parents, guardians, teachers, and other adults in the minor's life may also be held accountable for some ethical violation committed by that child, especially if the adult in question had the ability to prevent or control the issue before it became a problem.

, You may not have the power to solve the issue alone, but someone does. Figure out who has power in these circumstances to help guide your next move.You'll need to keep in mind the minors' rights and the parents' rights. Even though their power may not be able to solve the issue, it is still a power that must be addressed and worked with.
Typically, the power to solve the issue rests with multiple people, including some type of authority. Issues taking place at school might require the involvement of school officials. On the other hand, issues taking place in the neighborhood or in a minor's home might require help from police or social workers.

, Resources can include institutional hierarchies, other people, books, and more.


You might turn to a supervisor or colleague and ask for advice on how to proceed based on his or her past experiences. That individual may also be able to provide you with additional information or clarification.
Similarly, you can read articles or books that address the issue according to setting and severity. Doing so will give you greater access to information that is more useful to your specific set of circumstances.

, Make a list of all possible actions you can take, keeping in mind that inaction is also considered an action for these purposes. Write out the positive and negative consequences of each option.


When reviewing your options and choosing the best one, make sure that the ethical issue is being actively addressed in the best way possible. You need to be able to defend your final decision on an ethical and legal basis.

, After deciding on a plan, carry it forward. Notify any authorities you need to notify and commit to any personal involvement you may need to accept.


Even if the actual power to solve the issue rests outside of your hands, you should still follow up with the process as much as you are legally allowed to do. Make sure that things are being handled properly, and if they aren't, be prepared to elevate the issue to the next level.

Have a list of items to talk about ready beforehand.,
Be alert, upbeat, and ready to talk.,
Be completely open.,
Be ready to discuss your role in the âbig picture.â Most supervisors love when their employees have positive or insightful ideas about how they fit into the company as a whole.,
Be honest about what isnât working for you.,
React to criticism seriously but never angrily.,
Consider your criticism objectively.,
Set reasonable goals for improvement.,

Donât neglect any minor criticisms you were given.,
Donât rest on your laurels.",How to Respond to a Job Performance Review," No matter whether you're given lavish praise or scathing criticism, your supervisor will want to see that you're taking the process seriously. One great way to do this is to have a brief list of talking points prepared beforehand (either written down or memorized). No matter how bad things get, a smart boss will have respect for an employee that puts in the extra effort necessary to get as much as possible from their review.


Two things youâll definitely want to be ready to talk about are your biggest accomplishments and your biggest challenges â these topics of conversation can lead to valuable advice from your supervisor.;
, Most reviews are a back-and-forth dialog between an employee and a supervisor, rather than a simple one-way lecture. You'll probably be expected to open up about your feelings about your job, your successes, your struggles, and your working relationships with your other employees. For this reason, it's best to show up alert, well-rested, and prepared to talk all about your job. Try to stay focused on the conversation during your review â your review demands your full attention, so don't let yourself daydream or lose track of the proceedings.


For people who naturally get nervous before performance reviews, it probably won't be hard to muster the energy necessary to give the appearance of being alert and focused. In these cases, however, you may want to take steps to ensure you're not too jittery â avoid coffee, take deep breaths, and, if you can, get plenty of exercise the day before to keep yourself relaxed.

, A job performance review is no place to be shy. Treat your review like a chance to be completely frank about any opinions you have about the job, whether they're positive or negative (without being rude, of course). This includes opinions about your pay, your working conditions, your coworkers, and even your managers. You don't get this opportunity very often â normally, employees are expected to be much more guarded. Keep in mind, however, that the supervisor giving the review has the opportunity to be just as frank about you.


If you're naturally shy or have a hard time talking about your closely-held opinions, it can help to practice talking about these points beforehand with a close friend or a coworker you trust outside of work. You may also want to try body language-based confidence-boosting techniques, especially straightening your posture, talking slowly, looking the person you're talking to in the eye.These basic tricks can help you loosen up in a wide variety of stressful social situations, including those related to your job.

, All companies want to be as cost-efficient as possible â they are always looking for ways to keep their costs low and get the greatest possible use out of their existing assets. Thus, showing that the work you do plays a role in the company's continued success can help paint yourself as a valuable employee even if your job isn't an extremely important one.


This is something you'll definitely want to bring up if you're being heavily criticized during your review â showing that you understand what you mean to the company can tell your supervisor that the poor behavior you're being criticized for isn't a result of you not taking your duties seriously.

, It can be stomach-churning to talk to a supervisor about problems you have with your job, especially if those problems have to do with their management style. However, since a performance review is likely one of the only times you'll be directly asked about these things, it's an opportunity you won't usually want to pass up. Smart supervisors will appreciate polite criticism â they, too, have supervisors, and they want to be able to demonstrate that they're doing everything they can to make their employees as happy and productive as possible.As hinted at above, a positive performance review is an especially smart place to bring up things that are making your job harder. A supervisor who considers you a competent, valuable employee is much more likely to take your problems seriously than one who considers your work sub-par.

, Criticism is a very real possibility during your performance review. Nearly everyone has some aspect of their work that they can improve on, so try not to be offended or scared for your job security if you receive some gentle suggestions for improvement. Acknowledge the criticism and move on â don't lose your cool, even if you think your supervisor's criticisms aren't particularly true.


Note that there is such a thing as criticism that's too harsh or personal for a job performance review. If, for instance, your supervisor insults you, makes inappropriate remarks about you, your family, or your personal life, or otherwise attacks you for something other than your work, hold your tongue during your review and contact your Human Resources department afterward to discuss your supervisor's behavior.

, It's easy to feel personally offended by criticism during a job performance review. However, unless your supervisor attacked you personally (as described above), you have no reason to be offended. A performance review is meant to be a constructive exercise aimed at improving your work, not one aimed at undermining you or making you feel bad about yourself. The only thing being judged is your work, not you personally.


If you're having a hard time taking your mind off of the criticism you received during a difficult review, try using a technique called ""Thought Awareness."" As you feel yourself getting angry, sad, or discouraged in the face of criticism, take the opportunity to think about your thoughts. Think about why you feel the way you do and critically observe your own stream of consciousness.By ""getting out of your own head,"" you give yourself a chance to react logically to your criticism, rather than reacting to the way it makes you feel.

, Once you've had a chance to calmly and objectively think about the criticism you've received, give yourself a few goals for improvement. These should be challenging, but completely within your grasp. Even more importantly, they should be sustainable â the sorts of things you can achieve consistently. They shouldn't be the sorts of things you can achieve once but won't be able to stick to â this can leave you looking even worse than when you started.


The best goals are ones with definite, quantifiable goals, not those focused on vague self-improvement. For instance, if you've been criticized for showing up late to work, it's much smarter to say to yourself, ""I will go to bed at 11:00 PM and wake up at 7:00 AM every day so that I have plenty of time to make it to work,"" than it is to say, ""I will try much harder to make it to work on time.""

, It's possible that the criticism you received during your review was a result of you simply not having the skills necessary to perform well in your job. If your supervisor didn't lay out a path for you to get this training, contact the Human Resources Department and ask them for guidance.


If your company is interested in grooming you for more responsibility, take your initial criticism as a hidden compliment â training is expensive and a sign that your company is invested in your growth with them.

, If your supervisor has seriously criticized your work, they'll be looking for some sort of measurable improvement in the near future. Don't let your hard work go unnoticed. Make a point to bring up your improvement during your next meeting or one-on-one talk and be ready to back up your claim with evidence.


To make a great impression after being criticised during a review, make an effort to start âchecking inâ with your supervisor to discuss your progress. As soon as you've made some sort of accomplishment that demonstrates your progress, bring it up during your ""check in"" session. For instance, if your boss originally brought up the fact that your level of output in terms of progress on your projects has been slipping, you'll definitely want to mention when you finish your next project early.

, Usually, performance reviews are the sort of thing you'll want to keep to yourself about. Like your salary, this type of information can lead to jealousy and hurt feelings if you're too open about it. Don't bring up the results of your review in casual conversations. Instead, only consider discussing your review with your family, your friends outside of work, and select coworkers you have a great amount of trust in.


If, for some reason, you do need to discuss your results with others, be tactful. Don't brag or joke about your results â you'll never know how they'll compare to your fellow coworkers'.

, Nothing can change the past, so don't spend time worrying about it. If you continue to fume and wallow over negative aspects of a performance review long after it's over, you won't have the energy or focus to improve your work. Instead, once you have accepted the review (and, if necessary, have sought help or training), let go of the negativity. Look to the future, seeking out new ways to do your job better than before.


It can be difficult, but try to keep a positive mood after a negative review. Being visibly sad or sullen on the job can reflect poorly on your work, making you look like an under-performer even if youâre taking other steps to improve your output. It can also call unnecessary attention to yourself, prompting your coworkers to wonder or ask about your sudden change in mood. Since supervisors know that their employees' morale can affect the business's productivity, this can get you in even more trouble., Congratulations! A positive performance review is something to be very proud about â it's a sign that your supervisor is happy with your work and that your position is most likely secure for the near future. A positive review is almost always something you have to work hard to earn, so take the opportunity to feel good about yourself.


You may even want to have a small celebration with your family and friends after a good review. This is a great idea, but be careful not to spread the word about your celebration among your fellow employees â this can hurt the feelings of people who didn't get good reviews.

, Never stop trying to improve your work. Demonstrate your long-term dedication to your job by trying to improve even after you've been told you're doing a good job. Remember that a positive review isn't an invitation to take a break â rather, it's a sign that your employer loves the work you're doing and wants more.


Keep in mind that, at most jobs, there are very real rewards to striving for excellence. For instance, if your supervisor only has one promotion to give to their employees, they'll probably give it to the person that strove to improve their work, rather than one that was content getting mostly positive reviews.

, A positive performance review doesn't necessarily have to be 100% positive. Take note of any criticisms you do receive during your review and give them the same amount of attention you'd give the criticisms from a negative review. Supervisors love employees who aren't satisfied with ""good enough"", so look for opportunities to go the extra mile and earn a 100% positive review next time.


In addition, it's worth remembering that, at your next review, your supervisor will probably bring up these past criticisms. It can be very embarrassing to explain to your supervisor that you haven't taken any action based on these criticisms, so don't put yourself in this position.

, Don't make the mistake of slacking off after you've been given a good review. This signals to your boss that your continued effort at your job is dependent on the level of praise you receive, rather than a result of your personal dedication. Over time, an employee who's content to rely on past achievements to justify their existence can make a prime candidate for downsizing, so never stop setting (and meeting) ambitious goals for yourself.

If a coworker punches, slaps, or assaults you, then they have also committed a criminal act.;
, Verbal bullying may be harder to detect since most workplaces have some amount of occasional verbal conflict. Nevertheless you should try to recognize the different varieties of verbal bullying:Shouting or swearing at an employee when you do not shout at all employees
Singling out an employee for unjustified criticism or blame
Excluding an employee from company activities or ignoring their contribution to work projects
Practical jokes that repeatedly target one person or a small group

, You may be the victim of bullying without necessarily knowing it. There are some warning signs that you should be aware of. These warning signs include:You feel like vomiting the night before you start your work week.
You use all of your paid time off for âmental health breaks.â
You feel physically and emotional exhausted all of the time.
You begin to believe that you have provoked the workplace cruelty.
Your boss calls surprise meetings that serve no other purpose than to humiliate you.
People at work have been told to stop working or socializing with you.
Human Resources tells you the harassment isnât illegal but something for you and your tormentor to work out yourselves. Also, other coworkers and supervisors recognize the bullying but do nothing about it.
You are accused of harassment yourself when you confront your tormentor.

, Bullying can have harmful effects on its victims which can last for years. Victims experience stress and depression, financial problems from missed work, and sleep disorders.According to the Workplace Bullying Institute, workplace bullying is like domestic violence, except that it takes place at work.Workplace bullying also has negative consequences for organizations, which can suffer lost productivity, high employee turnover, and potential lawsuits or investigations.If you are a supervisor and you observe your employees bullying each other, then you will want to deal with the problem swiftly.

, Your company may have policies that spell out how you may lodge a complaint about bullying. Look in your company manuals or handbook or review your employment contract. If you canât find anything, then contact Human Resources and ask what the current policy is.

, If you belong to a union, then your collective bargaining agreement should outline a grievance procedure. You should read the agreement and find the appropriate procedure to follow.


You should also contact your union representative and fill them in on the details of the bullying.

, Before reporting the bullying, you should try to document as best you can the offending behavior.If you have emails or voicemails, then preserve those. If the bullying happened face-to-face, then try to remember the important details:


when and where the bullying occurred
who participated in the bullying
the substance of the bullying
the names of any witnesses

, You should not hesitate to report bullying. Often bullies donât even realize how others perceive them; once their behavior is brought to their attention, many are willing to change.Accordingly, you should follow your companyâs procedures for reporting harassment or bullying.


If your company has no policy, then you should nevertheless speak to your supervisor, unless the supervisor is the offender, in which case you should contact Human Resources.

, If bullying is based on a personâs race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, national origin, or disability, then it constitutes illegal discrimination. Age discrimination is also illegal if the person is over 40. The federal agency tasked with enforcing the federal anti-discrimination laws is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

According to one estimate, about 20% of workplace bullying also involves illegal discrimination., Your state or county may have anti-discrimination laws that are much broader than the federal laws. You should find all applicable laws by performing a web search. Type âyour stateâ and âdiscriminationâ or âanti-discriminationâ into a search engine.


If you canât find anything, then contact your stateâs Department of Labor and ask about state-specific anti-discrimination laws.

, The EEOC has created an online assessment tool that will tell you if the EEOC is the correct agency to contact. To use the tool, visit the EEOC website at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/.

, Although the EEOC is the federal agency tasked with investigating claims of illegal discrimination, states may also create their own agencies. If you live in a state with its own agency, then you will have the option of contacting either the federal EEOC or your state agency. Frequently, state agencies provide workers greater rights, so it makes sense to go with your state agency if that is the case.


To find the EEOC office nearest you, use the EEOCâs locator at http://www.eeoc.gov/field/. Enter your zip code.

, You cannot file a complaint (called a âchargeâ) online.You must either visit the field office or send a charge by writing.


Depending on the office, you may have to schedule an appointment or you might be able to meet with someone by walking in. Call ahead of time to check if you need to schedule an appointment.

, You must make sure that your letter contains sufficient information to allow the EEOC to investigate your charge. Make sure that the letter contains the following:your contact information (name, address, and telephone number)
your employerâs contact information (name, address, and telephone number)
the number of employees employed at your worksite
a short description of the events you believe were discriminatory
when the events happened
why you believe you were discriminated against (e.g., race, religion, etc.)
your signature

, The EEOC or a state agency will investigate your charge by contacting your employer. If you want to bring a subsequent lawsuit, then you will probably want an attorney. To find an experienced employment lawyer, visit your stateâs bar association, which should run a referral service.


Employment law attorneys can charge hourly rates between $250 and $600.They may also be open to representing you on contingency. Under this arrangement, the attorney will only collect a fee if you win your case. The fee will be a percentage of your damages award (typically 35-40%). You would still be responsible for court costs, such as filing fees.
If you want someone just to talk to, then you might want to see if a legal aid organization exists in your area. Legal aid organizations provide low cost or free legal services to those in financial need. To locate a legal aid organization, use the Legal Services Corporationâs locator at http://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid.

Wash your sneakers by hand.",How to Clean Smelly Sneakers1," Take a bit of soap and water and scrub them down. Then, using a hair dryer and towel, dry them off. Be sure to scrub carefully so that you don't damage the shoe.


Consider using bleach to help. Reserve this for sneakers that won't be damaged or lose color from the bleach.;

Communicate your working hours and time limits.,
Leave the office at a regular time.,
Address boundary violations immediately.,
Learn to say âno.â It can be hard to turn down a new project but sometimes this is necessary to maintain balance between work and personal life.,
Schedule a regular day off.,
Prioritize time for self-care.,
Avoid excessive overtime hours.",How to Set Boundaries at Work1," Tell your boss and your colleagues about your normal working hours and reinforce these hours by sticking to them. In addition, be honest about how long a project might take you to complete. Do not promise to finish a task sooner than you are able to do it. It can also help to tell your boss about some of your general responsibilities at home, so there is an understanding that you have other responsibilities to fulfill outside of work hours.If you determine your working hours, try telling people your hours and sticking to them. For example, if you work a nine-hour day, tell people you work from 8AM to 5PM and stick to those hours.
If there is an expectation of availability during non-work hours, communicate the precise hours during which you are available to talk on the phone or chat online. Stick to those hours and keep the rest of the time to yourself.
Tell your boss about your commitments. You could say, âI volunteer with the food bank on Thursday evenings, so I canât work late that night. And I have basketball games right after work on Tuesdays, so I canât take any extra work on Tuesdays either.â
If you are single or childless, you are at even greater risk of overwork since many employers may think that you wonât have anything to do outside of work. In this case, you need to clearly communicate your need for balance, which is key to maintaining physical and mental health.;
, Once you have communicated your working hours and boundaries, you should stick to them. If you are scheduled to work until 5PM, you should leave at 5PM. Avoid being coerced into any workplace games such as staying at work just to avoid being the first one to leave or staying as late as possible to show your high commitment. Increasingly, employers are beginning to understand that a culture of overwork actually decreases productivity so it is healthy and productive to establish firm boundaries.You might want to set an alarm that goes off about ten minutes before you can leave. This will let you wrap up any work and start packing to leave on time.
Avoid making exceptions to this rule. If you enforce that you will only work until 5PM but you start working more and more until 6PM, then your boss and coworkers will think that your boundaries are flexible.

, Rather than waiting until your next workplace evaluation or another date, tell your boss about any boundary violations as soon as possible. Otherwise, the event may not hold the same significance and you may not be taken seriously. If you were coerced into working late on a weeknight despite having established firm evening work boundaries, you should talk to your boss about it soon afterwards. You might say, âI know we had to meet that deadline but I take my parenting responsibilities seriously and I canât afford to miss another weeknight dinner. It would be great if we could finish projects during working hours next time around.â

, If you already have a sufficient number of projects on the go to keep you busy and financially stable, you should learn to say ânoâ to new projects that will only add stress to your already busy work schedule., It is important to schedule a day for rest. Every week, you should have at least one day when you do not answer work emails, phone calls, or schedule any meetings. If possible, avoid engaging with workplace technologies such as computers or doing work online, since this could tempt you into answering a work email.Don't feel nervous or ashamed to use your vacation time. Vacations help restore energy and improve productivity when you return to work.

, By scheduling regular time for self-care such as a yoga class or a walk in the park, you can replenish your energy and maintain a sense of wellbeing. Prioritize the time you devote to self-care and maintain your commitments in this sphere of life, even if it means leaving work at a certain time or not answering email for a few hours or until the next day.Try a new yoga class. Look into new classes at your yoga studio and make time to try something new. You will feel better and get to enjoy time away from work for a few hours. Yoga can help you manage stress and improve flexibility.Schedule a massage appointment. If you are feeling stressed out from work, you should schedule an appointment for a massage so that you can physically recover from workplace stress. Massage can reduce anxiety and stress, as well as treat problems like headaches., It can be tempting to say âyesâ to overtime, especially if there is more money involved. However, remember that every extra hour you work overtime is time away from your personal life and family. If you do work overtime, try to limit your hours so you can maintain some semblance of work-life balance."

Decline an office cellphone.,
Turn off email notifications on your smart phone.,
Avoid responding to non-urgent email and phone messages.",How to Set Boundaries at Work2," If your new job comes with a company cellphone, consider whether you can turn it down. Your company cellphone comes with many strings such as constant connectivity with your workplace outside of work hours. If you turn down the company cellphone and stick to your personal cellphone, fewer people will have access to your telephone number and you will be more likely to have time to yourself on the weekend., If your phone tells you about each new email in your inbox, it can be hard to completely ignore it. This can reduce your chances of enjoying personal time during off hours or on the weekend. To avoid this problem, simply turn off the email notifications on your smart phone. Instead, just check it at regular times that work for you., If you check email on the weekend or in the evening, try to remember that not every message needs an immediate response. If you respond to every message on a workday evening, you may find you have little time left to yourself.Avoid opening work email outside of work hours. If possible, simply ignore your email inbox during non-work hours.
If you are on vacation or on sick leave, avoid checking your email. Instead, set an automatic away message explaining that you are out of the office for a few days.

Set relationship boundaries at work.,
Avoid taking things too personally.,
Share your emotional life wisely.,
Manage your emotional boundaries.",How to Set Boundaries at Work3," Decide on the boundaries that you want to have with colleagues in terms of both friendships and potential romantic relationships. You should consider whether or not you would ever date someone from work. If you know your boundary on this issue, you will be prepared if and when a romantic relationship ever presents itself as a possibility. Further, you should consider the level of intimacy and friendship you are comfortable having with co-workers such as, for instance, whether you want to share your cell phone number or social media pages with colleagues.If you do not want to share your personal cell phone number, you could tell your colleagues to contact you by other means such as email or your work phone.
If you do not want to talk about personal relationships or beliefs with colleagues and one of your colleagues asks about your private life, you could say: âI donât talk about my personal life at work. No offense, but I prefer to talk about work related matters or the news.â
If you do not want to date anybody from work and one of your colleagues asks you out, you could try saying: âSorry, thatâs very sweet but I have a strict no dating policy with people from work. I find this works best for me. Try somewhere else.â

, If you have a colleague who offers excessively frank or negatively worded criticism, try not to take it too personally. You have the right to protect yourself from negative energy and language in the workplace. First, remind yourself that you donât have to take the burden of other peopleâs emotional baggage, since it is not in your job description. Second, you can follow up with someone to resolve the issue more directly, such as by talking to the human relations department or a superior.Tell a superior or human relations manager about your experience: âA colleague of mine is being really overbearing and negative recently. They took me aside after our last meeting and told me that all of my contributions were horrible and that I should go back to my old job. Their criticisms are not constructive and make me feel really terrible. What can be done?â

, If you feel very comfortable with someone at work and sense that you can be frank with them, try not to overburden them with your thoughts and feelings. Try to filter yourself a little bit so that you are not overbearing with colleagues. If you are not sure whether or not you are overbearing, ask a colleague:Ask a colleague: ""Am I being overbearing at work right now?""
Inquire with a colleague: âDo you think I was too blunt in our conversation yesterday. Do you think I could have been more tactful in that conversation?â

, It can be difficult to find the right balance between being open and protecting yourself in the workplace. Figure out where you are in your workplace relationships and then work towards a balance between maintaining your boundaries and getting to know your colleagues in an open and professional manner. In the end, you want to find the sweet spot between too little and too much openness in your workplace relationships. This sweet spot is relaxed and professional, with established boundaries and a comfortable degree of openness.Avoid volatility in your workplace relationships. At one extreme of imbalance, some people are volatile in the sense of not being able to enforce emotional boundaries for themselves and exposing other people to their insecurities.
Avoid excessive vulnerability. You want to be able to protect your emotional boundaries at work, so avoid being too vulnerable to other peopleâs comments and opinions about you.
Avoid being overbearing. If you are excessively confident and frank, avoid imposing your opinions and feelings on your colleagues in an overbearing manner.
Avoid being walled off. If you are good at protecting yourself from others and also avoid sharing your thoughts and feelings with others at work, you may be too walled off.
Evaluate your work relationships every now and then. Are you benefiting from these relationships? If things aren't going well, distance yourself from your coworkers on non-work related matters.

Pride yourself on your results.

",How to Consistently Run if You're Overweight," It might be a hard task to think about, but a very rewarding afterwards.;
, The right gear is indeed important.

, Try getting a 2.2 liter (0.6Â USÂ gal) jug from a local grocery store, using an old soda bottle will work for a little while, but eventually you'll want to upgrade. This makes water intake easier, as you don't constantly have to keep refilling it.

, They say that people who write down their goal, and post it somewhere they will see it every day, have a 100% success rate of meeting those goals. That's because every single day, it helps them be reminded of why they do what they do. They never lose sight.

, If you run every day at the same time, be it mornings or evenings, it makes it easier to get around to doing. It will also make your body used to it that much faster.

, Those days when like fifty excuses come up, such as needing to mow the lawn, having to make dinner, procrastinating on laundry, etc. The thought of, ""Where am I going to fit in a run? I'll just do it tomorrow."" Never put a run off until tomorrow. Not only will you gain that much more pride, by looking at all the things you did that day, but your body will be that much better for it. Now that's not to say you'll go your full distance, but the majority of the time all you have to do is get out the door.

,, Songs for your MP3 player are essential for surviving any run. Otherwise, it's just running, and that sucks. So buy music. Why not just listen to what you have? Because if you run consistently, that means a good 4-5 hours a week of listening to those songs. So buy some new ones, and hold them off as an incentive to run.

Think about missed events.",How to Spot Workaholic Warning Signs," If youâre the first to arrive and the last to leave, this can indicate workaholic tendencies.Look around for who else in the office shares your hours or if you consistently work the most of all the employees.


For example, your workplace may expect employees to work 40 hours each week, yet you may often exceed these hours week after week.
Try keeping a log for a few weeks of when you arrive at work and when you leave. You may be working more than you thought you were.;
, If youâre prohibited from working for some reason, this might make you feel stressed. For example, if you go away on vacation, you may feel stressed being away from your workplace and feel like youâre missing out on getting things done. Or, you might become upset when the power goes off or the network goes down during the workday. If you feel stressed when you cannot work, this can be a sign of being a workaholic.If you forget to bring your laptop home with you one night to finish your work, this may cause extreme stress.

, You might wonder how you can spend more time at work. This might be going in earlier in the mornings, or cutting certain after-work activities so that you can stay later. While some people make adjustments to their schedules occasionally, the workaholic may spend more time at work when it is unnecessary or even discouraged.For example, you may think, âIf I cut out my morning exercise, I can start work 30 minutes early.â
Think about whether you have been cutting back on other activities in favor of work, such as your interests, hobbies, or certain responsibilities.
Cutting out time with family and friends to make more time for work is especially detrimental. If you are willing to sacrifice your relationships, then this is a red flag.

, You may turn to work on weekends, during vacations, or while youâre in bed.If you fill your free time with work, this can be a symptom. You may go away for the weekend and debate taking your work or feel negligent not doing work in your free time.


If you make time for other activities yet feel anxious being away from your work, this can be a sign of being a workaholic.

, Your friends, family, and co-workers may notice your long hours and say something to you, yet you might blow it off or ignore what they say.You may shrug the comments off or become defensive. If multiple people comment on your work habits, it might be time to listen in and be open to their feedback.


For example, your manager may say, âYouâre working a lot, yet other people are on the team, too. Why donât you cut back?â Yet, you may not be able to comprehend how to cut back or you may completely ignore the comment.
If your partner or children express their displeasure with how much you work, take it very seriously.

, You may sign up for projects or assignments when itâs unnecessary. You may think that no one else can do it or will do it, so you will take it on.Perhaps you believe yourself to be the only one capable of heading projects or completing tasks, so you do them out of perceived necessity.


For example, you might take on multiple presentations because you believe your co-workers are less capable of making sales pitches than you are, so you do all of them.
Think about whether your decision to take on extra work is need-based, ego-based, or desire-based. Try to only take on extra work that is need-based.

, A workaholic may read or do work during meals. This might include doing work during your lunch break while at your workplace or taking materials home and working during dinner.You might expect to work through meals or feel agitated or bored if you eat a meal without work in front of you.


Perhaps you count on having work with you through meals and often turn down invitations to meet for lunch or dinner due to work.

, Workaholics may experience declines in their health due to overworking.The negative influence of work can affect your health in ways that may require medical intervention. Particularly if your job is very stressful, overworking can affect your health through heart problems, poor circulation, high cholesterol, poor sleep, low energy levels, and depression.If youâve noticed major declines in your health since working longer hours, this may be an indication that youâre overworking.

Signs of depression may include sadness, irritability, trouble focusing or remembering things, intrusive negative thoughts, and thoughts of suicide or death., You may turn to work as a way to cope with feelings of guilt, anxiety, helplessness, or depression.If you tend to cope with your feelings by putting in more work or spending more time at your workplace, this can be an unhealthy way of coping and contribute to being a workaholic.


Do you tend to work longer hours when you feel stressed or overwhelmed in another part of your life? One way to test this is to clear your schedule for a while and see if your anxieties about other things become more intense.
Consider dealing with emotions by seeing a therapist, engaging in exercise, starting a meditation program, or writing in a journal.

, Your work habits may negatively affect your relationships with others, including a spouse or partner, children, family, and friends. Perhaps you previously were involved in regular events with your family, yet now spend little time with them due to work. Your friends and family may comment that they rarely see you or spend time with you because of work. Your working habits may cause tension in relationships.You may also feel emotionally disconnected or like you are out of the loop regarding your family members.
A workaholic may look forward to work more than family activities or events. Perhaps you plan a meeting or work event during a time you know your family is getting together.

, If you tend to miss important events due to work such as your childrenâs concerts or recitals or family events, this can indicate a symptom of workaholism.Your friends and family may begin to assume you will not be present at gatherings or be surprised when you show up.


You may be in the habit of saying no to events and casually dismiss other peopleâs disappointment at your absence.

Get a running buddy.",How to Start Jogging," Running requires very little equipment, but the one requirement it does have--good, supportive shoes--is crucial. Running exerts three- to five-times your bodyâs weight of pressure on your joints and muscles, which adds up to quite a bit of stress on your lower body.The two major factors you need to take into consideration when figuring out your shoe needs are cushioning and support.
The larger your body frame, the more cushioning youâll need. You can also factor in your particular preferences here: if you like a cushion-like feel, look for more cushion, while if you prefer closer-to-the ground sensation, opt for less.The amount of support youâll need will depend on the height of your arch and how flexible your feet are. If you have a high arch, your feet are likely less flexible and so require a lesser level of support, while if you have a low arch, youâll need a higher level of support.;
, Once you have a sense of what you need from a running shoe, itâs time to go out and invest in a quality pair.


Running with the wrong shoes (ie, any kind of shoe not made for running or a worn-out pair of running shoes) is the fastest way to develop an injury and sideline yourself. Running with the right shoes, on the other hand, can help your form, help prevent injury, and extend your running stamina.
Go to your local running store to get a pair of shoes custom fitted to you. Running shoes require a small initial outlay that can run anywhere from $60 to over $100, so if you plan to start jogging, figure the cost of shoes into your plan.
A number of shoe retailers and brand websites offer shoe finders that will help you pinpoint the right kind of shoe for your needs. But because you may not exactly know your needs, particularly if youâre just starting out, these can be a less-than-precise tool. Your best option is to go in person to a running store where employees can watch your stride and guide you to the best shoe.
Donât get taken in by new and innovative âextras.â You donât need any elaborate bells and whistles, just a shoe that offers the right amount of cushioning and support for your needs.Because running shoes are functional, always go for form over fashion. Yes, some running shoes come in an appetizing array of rainbow day-glo colors, but remember that ultimately your shoes need to protect your joints and muscles, not dazzle them.
Be sure to give shoes a test run before committing. This is another reason going to your local running store is ideal--it will allow you to jog around in your shoes before committing to them. If you buy your shoes online, be sure to buy from a site that will let you easily return or exchange them if needed. Be sure to wear the same socks you plan to run in when testing out shoes.Youâll know you have the rights shoes for you when you donât experience discomfort during or after the run. If your shoes give you blisters, cause chafing, or make your feet sore, you need to either have the fit adjusted or replace the shoes.
You should replace your running shoes after about 350-500 miles (560-800 kilometers), when you see any part of the shoe beginning to wear out, or if the shoes begin causing you pain., The two major options for runners are of course outdoor running or indoor running on an indoor track or on a treadmill.


Take into account the weather where you live, the time of day youâll be exercising, the kinds of surfaces available for you to run on, and the safety of areas where youâll be running.
If you live somewhere with access to soft, level surfaces, like a college track or a well-tended grass playing field, you can consider those good outdoor jogging options.
In addition to offering a soft, level surface, an ideal outdoor running location should be well-lit and fairly popular with other exercisers.
If you donât have access to a safe, well-lit area with a soft, level running surface, running on a treadmill may be more ideal.
If you plan to exercise very early or very late in the day, running indoors on a treadmill may be the safer option.
Finally, if you live somewhere with extreme weather that may hinder your ability to run outdoors, your best option may be to explore running indoors.

, Before you dive into a running routine, begin by walking, particularly if youâre new to exercise or out of shape.Start by walking for 15-20 minutes a day 3-4 times a week.
Gradually increase the pace of your walking until jogging becomes the next logical step.

, Keeping your muscles limber and flexible is vitally important to avoiding injury and overdue stress on your body. Itâs crucial to warm up your muscles before you begin stretching to avoid strain and injury.Before stretching for your run, do a 5-10 minute warmup. Moving from top to bottom (or bottom to top), rotate your joints clockwise and counter-clockwise until they feel loose and easy.
After warming up your joints, spend at least 5 minutes doing an aerobic activity that will raise your heart rate, like jumping rope.
Next, begin stretching with slow and relaxed stretches. After doing a series of slow stretches, move on to more dynamic stretches like leg raises and arm swings.
Once your muscles feel loose and warm, begin your workout.
After you finish your workout, spend 5-10 minutes cooling down with more dynamic stretches followed by more relaxed stretches. Doing so will improve strength and flexibility as well as help prevent soreness and muscle fatigue.

, When you begin running, even if youâre in shape from another sport, youâre using new muscles and will have to adjust accordingly. So start off slow.


On your first few runs, itâs recommended that you run for 5 minutes, then walk for 2 minutes and switch off for the duration of your run. This will give you a good workout while also allowing your body to adjust., Though most people assume how far and how long you run has purely to do with endurance and determination, having the proper running form actually quite significantly impacts your performance.Avoid heel-striking. When running, many people tend to overextend their leg when striding forward, resulting in an undue amount of heel striking, which is both bad for your form and for your lower body. When you land your front foot, your knee should be above your foot and your shin should be vertical.Imagine how you would run if you had on no shoes at all--you would avoid striking your heel because it would hurt. So when you go running, run with the barefoot model in mind.Keep your upper body relaxed. Consciously keep your jaw relaxed and your shoulders and avoid clenching your hands.
Hold your arms in a 90 degree position and keep them there--donât let them fall out of position on the back-swing.
Learn to ârun tall.â To help you maintain the right posture, remind yourself to ârun tallâ--that is, hold your body as though someone were pulling you up by you hair, with a slight forward lean.You want your hips and shoulders relaxed and level and your arms to the sides of your body. To help you get the sense of what the proper position feels like, interlock your hands and rest them on your head, then run. Thatâs the body position you want to maintain.Keep your arms beside your body. Donât allow your arms to cross over your body--itâs bad form and it wastes energy. Instead, imagine grabbing belt loops with your thumbs as you move your arms back and forth to help keep your arms parallel to your body.
Breathe regularly. Keep an even rate of breathing while running and âbreathe with your bellyâ--ie, take deep breaths into your stomach rather than shallow breaths into your chest. Try syncing your breathing with your steps as you run to help keep your breathing regular., Having a regular schedule is key to maintaining an exercise routine. If you find the right time of day and duration and stick to it, youâre more likely to maintain a steady and regular exercise regimen.


Look for a part of the day when you have enough time to devote to running without being stressed or rushed.
Consider safety as well--if youâll be running in the dark, wear bright colors and a light; if youâll be running in an isolated area, do so during the day and always carry a cell phone or other emergency communication device, and consider carrying a can of mace or pepper spray with you for self defense.

, There are a range of fitness apps out there that can do everything from track your average speed, distance, and calorie expenditure to turn your run into a game by putting you in the middle of a zombie-survival scenario.


Eventually, if you become a more serious runner, you can consider upgrading to dedicated running devices that track your vitals and progress in more detail.

, As you get into better shape, gradually increase your workouts to help prevent you from getting into an exercise rut.


Increase your run by about 10 percent per week. So, if you run 5 miles one week, increase it to 5.5 miles the next., Changing up your running routine is important to keep your body challenged so it doesnât fall into a fitness rut. Variation is also vital to keeping you from getting bored or discouraged with your routine.Integrating new terrain can help change up your routine, so try adding hills or stairs to your route.
Include intervals in your run. Intervals involve repeatedly alternating between running full out for several seconds followed by returning to a normal pace for several minutes.
Alternatively, you can choose a landmark, sprint to it, then return to your normal pace for several minutes before choosing another landmark, sprinting to it, returning to normal pace, and so on.Try running a longer distance at a slower pace. Doing so will vary the kinds of muscles and muscle strength needed to complete your run, which will not only help keep you in physical shape but help keep you from getting bored or complacent in your routine., Running with another person is a great way to stay motivated and to hold yourself accountable.


If you donât have any friends willing to join you, look up running-community sites online. Many of them offer services to help connect people looking for a running buddy or looking to join a running group."

Plan your usual running route.,
Run as normal.,
Slow down to the original pace, or even to a jogging pace, and allow your breathing and other systems to return to normal.

,
Add in another speed burst area.,
Vary the fartlek workout.,
Run the last part at an easy pace.",How to Do a Fartlek Workout," Identify parts of the route that you could use as indicators for when you can concentrate on speed bursts, such as a bend in the road, an area marked by trees or other objects. Note these areas mentally and get ready to start.;
, When you get near your identifying place, speed up as you head toward your landmark and maintain this speed for 200â400 meters (656.2â1,312.3Â ft).,, Again, increase your speed over a short area and slow down again.

, Runner's World has a similar suggestion which involves using a local city block as your track. Begin slowly for the first five to 10 steps, gradually increase the pace for 20 to 50 steps and then run as if you are racing for a full block. Slow it down right to a walk in between the fast parts and the gradual build-up again.

, This is important to help you to cool down and relax back into finishing the workout.

"
"
Do one long run a week.,
Gradually increase that long run by half a mile to a mile each week.,
Cut back on every fourth week or so, or you will risk injury.

,
If youâre increasing the duration of a run, cut back on the intensity.",How to Build up to Long Runs," Take good note of that â donât make all of your runs longer. If youâve been running 3 miles (4.8Â km) a day (for example) 3-4 times a week, donât suddenly make all your runs 4 miles (6.4Â km). Just pick one day a week to go longer.;
, Itâs not good to keep increasing without rest â so if you increase for 2-3 weeks straight, cut back on your long run one week before progressing the next. This means that if your long run progresses each week like so:


3.5 miles (5.6Â km), 4 miles (6.4Â km), then 4.5 miles (7.2Â km).
Take a cut-back week where you just do 3.5 miles (5.6Â km) on the fourth week.
Then go back to 4.5 miles (7.2Â km), then 5 miles (8.0Â km), and so on.

,, Do your long runs a little slower at first â later, when long runs arenât a problem for you, you can do faster-paced ones, but thatâs more of an intermediate/advanced tactic.

"
"
Look on maps or search on Google for local running tracks, fields or woods; itâs good to be able to get to know in which direction youâre running, where youâre starting from, the best routes and getting to the end.,
Invest in some good sportswear: tracksuit bottoms, tight fitting cycling shorts, and T-shirts made from breathable, light material.,
It is vital to exercise and stretch before runs.Stretching and doing some light jogging to warm up and relax your muscles is highly recommended to reduce the chance of pulling a muscle or straining your legs or ankles.

,
Eat a good breakfast before going for your run, something with plenty of carbohydrates, starch, iron and protein; these are important nutrients to take into your system as they slowly release energy, providing you with more strength, endurance and energy for your run.,
When running always start off doing a light jog and as you get nearer to your ending, increase your speed, never use up all your energy at the start because remember you have to go back to where you started donât you?,
Think about your diet; diet is very important and vital when it comes to sport, and especially running; 60-65% of your calorie intake should be of Carbohydrates; carbohydrates as I explained earlier give you slowly released energy.,Vitamins

,
Get your daily vitamins.","How to Get Into Running, Sprinting and Cross Country"," Sprinters, I would recommend using running tracks because they are better for your type of running style.;
, Always tie long hair back so you can see where you are running. Get a small, light backpack in which you can carry a small towel and water bottle to prevent dehydration.

,, Have a bowl of cereal, a glass of juice or milk, whole grain toasted bread, a banana and apple. Donât eat too much, but donât eat too little; balance out meals before doing any serious exercise, and then let your food digest for half an hour to one hour at the maximum.

, When you reach your final destination, do a brisk walk and drink some water; itâs important to do a brisk walk to cool you down and make sure the muscles donât seize up.

, You should eat things like:


Whole grain pasta
Boiled rice
Potatoes
Starchy vegetables
Fruits
Whole meal bread
Protein- 15-20% of your calorie intake should be of Protein. Runners, especially those doing long distances should consume 0.5g to 75g a day. Try to concentrate on protein that is low in fat and cholesterol such as lean meats, fish, low fat dairy products, poultry, whole grains and beans; if you are vegetarian eating nuts, tofu and greens will increase both protein and iron.
Fat- A high fat diet can quickly pack on the pounds, so try to make sure that no more than 20 - 25% of your total diet comes from fats. Stick to foods low in saturated fats and cholesterol. Foods such as nuts, oils, and cold-water fish provide essential fats called omega-3s, vital for good health and can help prevent certain diseases. Most experts recommend getting about 3,000 mg of omega-3 fat a day.

,, Runners don't get energy from vitamins, but they are still an important part of their diet. Exercise may produce compounds called free radicals, which can damage cells. Vitamins C, E, and A are antioxidants and can neutralize free radicals. Getting your vitamins from whole foods is preferable to supplementation; there's no strong evidence that taking supplements improves either health or athletic performance.


Minerals
Calcium: A calcium-rich diet is essential for runners to prevent osteoporosis and stress fractures. Good sources of calcium include low-fat dairy products, calcium-fortified juices, dark leafy vegetables, beans, and eggs. Your goal should be 1,000 to 1,300 mg of calcium per day.
Iron: You need this nutrient to deliver oxygen to your cells. If you have an iron-poor diet, you'll feel weak and fatigued, especially when you run. Men should aim for 8 mg of iron a day, and women need 18 mg. Good natural sources of iron include lean meats, leafy green vegetables, nuts, shrimp, and scallops.
Sodium and other electrolytes: Small amounts of sodium and other electrolytes are lost through sweat during exercise. Usually, electrolytes are replaced if you follow a balanced diet. But if you find yourself craving salty foods, it may be your body's way of telling you to get more sodium. Try drinking a sports drink or eating some pretzels after exercise.

Consider the surface you will be running on.This will significantly influence what kind of shoe will be best for your foot.,
Identify the kind of running you will do.It's important that you don't accidentally buy athletic shoes that aren't designed expressly for running.,
Receive a professional evaluation for your feet.,
Take your weight into account.,
Consult a doctor about injuries and physical impairments.,
Go to a specialty running shoe store for your fit.Different designs in shoes can drastically change the fit and feel of it.,
Try on your shoe later in the afternoon.,
Aim for shoes that are snug.,
Consider a half-size larger.The strain put on feet and the resulting swelling means that most runners have to buy a shoe that is a half size larger than their normal street shoe.,
Ask questions about the features of your shoe.A good pair of running shoes can be expensive, so you might want to avoid paying extra for unnecessary features.,
Keep an open mind.,
Inquire about specializations within your shoe type.Even if you are buying a specialty shoe, like a stability shoe or a motion control shoe, inside each of these categories are even more specializations.,
Break in your shoes to prevent blisters and increase comfort.While your shoes adjust to your feet and your feet adjust to your new shoes, there will probably be some very slight friction which could cause blisters.,
Ask about and make use of return policies.",How to Choose Running Shoes," For instance, if you are running on a track or court specially designed to be flat and offer grip, you won't need extra traction on your shoe. Generally:


Road/track running will require less traction and lighter weight.
Trail running should have good traction, support, and cushion for uneven ground.;
, There are many different categories of athletic shoes, like training shoes or walking shoes, though these are no ideal for indoor, track, cross country, sprint, or distance running., Many specialty running stores now have equipment that can analyze your gait (how you walk/run) and your foot type. This will help you to know whether or not you need support to prevent your foot from rolling inward (also called pronating). Though there are many different foot-types, the main three are:


Neutral footed runners, where your foot comes into contact with the ground toward the middle of the foot.
Overpronation, where your foot rolls inward too far.
Underpronation, where your foot rolls inward too far, resulting in the smaller, outer toes of your feet doing more work than necessary at the push off., The heavier you are, the greater the impact between your foot and the ground will be.This increase in impact may require you to purchase shoes with additional support, even if your foot-type is neutral and you normally would not be advised in that way.


You may want to bring this attention to your doctor or the expert helping you decide on your shoes, especially if you already feel foot, leg, or back pain.

, You may have an injury that influences your gait, or a physical impairment that does the same. In both these instances, you should check with your doctor as to what kind of shoes would offer the best support and running experience with you.

, Sometimes the materials used in making a shoe can make it feel uncomfortable, stiff, or heavy. Prevent this from happening by trying on many different pairs at a physical store.


Although buying shoes online can be affordable, there is no real substitute for trying on shoes in person.
The wrong choice in shoe can cause pain, injury, or discomfort., This may sound silly, but over the course of the day, your feet become swollen from physical activity. By trying on your shoe later in the day, you will prevent buying a shoe that is too small.You might also consider:


Trying on shoes after a run. This will simulate the max size of your foot.
If you have orthotics or generic supports, bring these with you. These should be taken into consideration during your fitting.

, If you feel pinching or uncomfortable rubbing, that shoe is likely not your best fit. Over the course of your run, your feet will swell in size. Also, over the course of your running, the uncomfortable features will likely become worse with each mile, causing you unnecessary discomfort.


Walk around in your shoes when trying them on. Maybe even take a few laps around the store, if permitted. This way, you'll have a better feel for fit of the shoe., A good rule of thumb is to test your shoe by:


Slide your foot forward in your shoe.
Insert a finger in between your foot and the heel of the shoe.
Verify there is a finger's width of space to prevent your shoes from being cramped when towards the end of a run.

, Ask the shoe clerk helping you about features like:


Vents in the shoe.
The shape or configuration of the bottom of the shoe.
Transparent parts that show an ""air bladder"" for support.

, Even if there is a shoe that looks perfect for you, that's just in your color, do not let appearances deceive you into buying an uncomfortable shoe. You will be spending a lot of time and earning a lot of sweat in your new shoes. Try on many, and note the pairs that feel best., For example, a stability forefoot striking shoe will not serve a heel striker well.


Those who are prone to injury might consider maximalist running shoes, which are intended to even further reduce the force of impact., Begin breaking in your new shoes by going on shorter runs or walking. This way you run less of a risk of developing blisters.


Some recent studies have suggested that, especially for athletic and running shoes, you should be able to put your new footwear on immediately and be comfortable., Many shoe stores allow shoes to be returned up to a month after you have bought them.If, after a few test runs, you decide that your new shoes really don't suit your feet, return them and find something more suitable.

Breathe with your diaphragm.,
Take longer breaths.,
Keep your mouth open.,
Find a breathing pattern.,
Use the ""talk test"" to determine if you are breathing enough.You should be able to form full sentences while running without huffing and puffing.

,
Run or jog regularly.,
Do breathing exercises.,
Don't smoke.",How to Breathe While Running," The diaphragm is a muscle that sits like an upside-down bowl just beneath your ribs, contracting and relaxing to move air through your lungs. Deep ""belly breathing"" that visibly moves your abdomen in and out helps strengthen this muscle and improve your endurance.If your belly stays flat and your chest pumps up and down, you're taking shallow ""chest breaths,"" and will fatigue sooner.;
, This will help ensure that you are getting enough oxygen to your body, and is the best way to prevent muscle and lung fatigue. It also helps increase endurance by getting proper oxygen circulation to your muscles.

, Your mouth is wider than your nostrils, allowing you to take deeper breaths of air.Allow air to enter through both your mouth and your nose.

, Most experienced runners coordinate their breath with their steps, such as the popular ""inhale for three steps, exhale for two"" (or simply ""3â2""). This helps you breathe more consistently. You may also be forced to switch to a different pattern (such as ""2â1"") at higher speeds, which helps you keep track of the intensity of your run.There are several popular alternatives to these patterns, such as ""2-2"" or ""2-3."" Experiment with different breathing patterns to find the right one for you.

,, Running, just like any other physical activity, improves with practice. The better shape you are in aerobically, the easier it will be for you to breathe efficiently.

, Remember that just as we work to strengthen our muscles and hearts, we must also work to strengthen our lungs.


Practice taking deep breaths from your diaphragm while sitting still or lying on your back. Put your hand on your abdomen to make sure it moves up and down with each breath. Count to 8 for each inhale and exhale. Repeat for 3-5 minutes.
Swimming regularly can also improve lung function over time, because the exercise places an emphasis on breathing. It will also help you learn how to pace your breathing, because you must learn to coordinate your breath with the strokes you take.

, Smoking causes damage to your lungs, making it much more difficult for you to take deep breaths while running.

Measure your height from the floor to your belly button.,
Factor in your body type.,
Experienced hula hoopers can choose a smaller hoop.",How to Choose the Best Hula Hoop (Adult Sized)1," This measurement will then help to determine the diameter of the hoop you should purchase. The hula hoop, when resting vertically on the ground, should reach somewhere between your waist and mid-chest. This is your base diameter measurement and can be adjusted slightly depending on your size and experience level. For example, most adults will begin with a hula hoop between 40 and 44 inches in diameter. ;
, If you are smaller than average you can take 2â4 inches (5.1â10Â cm) off of the diameter determined by your height. Similarly, if you are larger than average you should add 2â4 inches (5.1â10Â cm) to the diameter determined as a result of the previous step. , If you are an experienced hula hooper you should use a smaller hoop. Similarly if you have a background in dance or are in good shape you can likely start with a slightly smaller hoop. For example, experienced hula hoopers can take 2â3 inches (5.1â7.6Â cm) off of the diameter size determined by their height.
If you are having trouble keeping the hoop up for at least 5-10 seconds then it is likely too small and you should use a larger hoop.

Expect the hoop to fall the first few tries as you get used to the motion.,
Have fun!








",How to Hula Hoop1," Wear a tight-fitting shirt and pants so it'll be easier to hula hoop and so the hoop won't get caught on any loose clothing.


Comfortable shoes will also make it easier for you to hula hoop. They don't have to be athletic shoes, and the choice of even wearing shoes at all, is optional. It will neither influence nor harm your attempt to hula hoop.
Avoid wearing any bracelets or any dangling jewelry that can get caught in the hula hoop.;
, Choose a hoop that reaches your chest or waist when you stand it on its side. Larger hoops are ideal for beginners because they spin more slowly, which gives you more time to adjust to the rhythm of the hoop.









If you're really committed to hula hooping, you can try hoops of a variety of weight and size to see what works best for you.

,, Place your hands apart at a comfortable distance.








, Step one foot in front of the other to gain balance.

, Relax the hoop against one side of your torso.

, If you're a righty, firmly spin the hoop counter-clockwise. If you're a lefty, spin it clockwise.








, Push your stomach forward as the hoop moves across your stomach. Push the hoop back when it moves across your back. Or you can rotate your waist in small circles and when the hoop touches your left hit your waist towards the left side and when the hoop touches your right hit towards the right.









Eventually you will find a perfect motion for pumping your torso.

, Keep moving your waist in a circular motion as you let go and aim to get the hoop to wrap itself around your waist like a barber's pole, round and round and round.









If the hoop falls below your waist or even falls to the ground, pick it up and try again.
When the hoop falls, try spinning it in the other direction. Though righties prefer to spin the hoop counter-clockwise and lefties prefer to spin it clockwise, you should still find the direction that works best for you. The direction you prefer is called your ""first direction"" or your ""in-flow."", Just pick up the hoop again and keep going. It is as much about getting the feeling for the motion as it is about following instructions.









Once you become more experienced as a hula-hooper, you can discover some tricks for recovering a falling hoop.

Go natural.,
Remove any belts with large buckles.

,
Be careful about necklaces, bracelets and earrings.

,
Remove any extra layers of clothing, such as jackets and sweaters.

",How to Wear Suitable Clothing for Hula Hooping," Wear clothes made from natural fibers (cotton, silk, linen, hemp and such) as much as possible. Synthetic clothes somehow allow less ""grab"" between your body and the hoop, causing the hoop to slip down your body.;

Decide on a heavier hoop if you are a beginner.,
Use a light hula hoop if you are short.,
Pick a hula hoop that has grips or add grips yourself.",How to Choose the Best Hula Hoop (Adult Sized)2," Hula hoops that are larger and heavier are great for beginners because the added weight gives the hoop more momentum as it moves around you making it easier to keep the hoop up. Heavier hoops are also suggested if you are learning a new skill or trick.

, If you are under 5 foot 4 inches (10.2Â cm) and relatively slim you will want to find a lighter hoop with a smaller tubing diameter. A smaller tubing diameter will make it easier for you to grip the hoop with your hands. A lighter hoop will also be easier to maneuver for a person with a small frame. , A hula hoop without grips can be slippery and difficult to keep up even for someone who is experienced. Purchasing a hula hoop with grips will allow you to have fuller contact with the hoop. Grips should be placed along the inner ring of the hoop to be the most effective. You can also wrap grips around the hoop to allow for fuller contact. Types of grips include: Sandpaper: use 100 grit or 80 grit sandpaper around the inner tubing, and add grooves into the hoop, which gives more texture for your hands, clothes, and body to connect with.
Griptape: is twisted around the hoop and comes in a variety of colors.
Hoop wax: is translucent and rubbed onto the hoop in the desired area. It is very sticky.

LED and fire hoops are also an option for those who want to take hula hooping to the next level.",How to Choose the Best Hula Hoop (Adult Sized)3," If you are interested in using your hula hoop for hoop dancing a lighter and smaller hoop is best for you. Similarly, you burn the most calories by moving a lot while hooping and working your entire body. A heavy hoop can be hard on your joints, especially when completing complex arm maneuvers.
Heavier hoops could also cause injury or break something in the room if it spins off your arm.

, It is often a good idea to have multiple different hula hoops in different sizes and weights. This way as you progress you can switch between hula hoops based on the activity you are completing. At times you may want to use a light and small hoop to complete complex tricks while at other times you may want a larger hoop for a longer workout. Also, by having more than one hoop you can share with friends!

, If you have mastered the regular hula hoop and are looking for a new challenge or want to try your hand at the performance arts LED and fire hoops are available for purchase. There are many online retailers that make and sell fire hoops. It is a good idea to buy these hula hoops in a slightly smaller size than normal and to practice extensively with them before igniting. They will have a different feel from your normal hoops.
Fire hoops also have an added wick that sticks out from the hoop to keep the fire a safe distance from the person using the hoop. As a result, you will need a larger space to practice.

Learn how to recover a falling hoop.,
Master some more hula hooping skills.",How to Hula Hoop2," If you feel like you're getting the hang of it and you don't want to keep picking up the hoop from the ground, you can also learn to recover the hoop when it's about to fall. This will make you look more like a pro and can let you spin the hoop for much longer. Here are a few things to try if the hoop falls below your waist:









Bend your knees below the hoop while pushing your hips really fast to get the hoop to move back up to your waist.
Turn your body in the direction of the flow of the hoop while pushing your hips really fast.
Move your body much quicker than normal to recover the position of the hoop.

, As you become more experienced as a hula hooper, you can add to your hula hooping repertoire by trying some new skills. Here's what you can do:









Practice moving faster. You can do this by shifting the weight between your feel more quickly, or by pumping your torso back and forth more quickly.
Move around as you hula hoop. To do this, turn your body in the direction that the hoop is moving. Shuffle your feet in the right direction.
Try the ""booty bump"". Instead of moving the hula hoop around your waist, try moving it along your butt.
Try moving the hoop up and down your body. An experienced hula hooper can make the hoop move above or below his waist while still recovering it.
If you really want to kick it up a notch, you can try spinning the hoop around your head or your arms, or even around just one of your legs. Lighter hoops work better for this trick.

Warm up your body.,
Improve your walking posture.,
Walk heel to toe.,
Avoid hyperextending your knee.,

Make walking a habit.,
Start gradually.,
Aim to walk for 21 minutes per day.,
Walk almost every day.,
Track your steps.,
Buy decent shoes for walking.,
Wear the right clothing.,
Stay safe.,
Switch the locale.,
Walk on a treadmill.",How to Walk," Warming up your body by starting slowly when you walk will reduce over-exertion on your muscles. This can help you walk longer, and at a better pace. Try to warm up by walking slowly for five to 10 minutes at the beginning of the walk.


This will loosen up your muscles and get them ready for exercise. To warm up do the following for 30 seconds each: Make circles with each ankle; swing each leg; make slow circles with your hips, make arm circles; and hop in place on both feet (known as Hula-hoop jumps).
Similarly, cool down at the end of your walk by slowing down for 5 to 10 minutes. After you cool down, stretch your muscles gently.
You can also stretch before you walk but if you do so, warm up your muscles first. Stretching can help you avoid walking injuries, such as strained muscles.;
, When walking, try to use purposeful movements when you stride and pay attention to your posture. Make sure you have good, erect posture. Try to look 12-20 feet in front of you as you walk.


Walk with your head up, while looking forward. Donât look down at the ground constantly as you walk, which could strain your neck.Relax your neck, shoulders and back. Although your posture should be strong, your body should not be held too stiffly as you walk.
Swing your arms with a slight bend in the elbows if you want. Tighten your stomach muscles, and donât arch your back forward or backward.

, When walking, you should step forward with your foot. Let your heel land on the ground in front of you. Then, roll your foot forward, transferring your weight to the ball of your foot. With your other foot, raise your hell, push your foot off the ground with your big toe, and repeat the first process.Walking is different from running. Your feet should never lift off the ground completely at the same time.
Find a stride that's comfortable for you. If you're losing track of the heel-to-toe motion, and aren't rolling your feet consistently, you may need to slow down.

, Hyperextending your knee means moving your knee backwards slightly when standing or walking. Many people have a natural tendency to hyperextend their knees, but hyperextending your knee can cause increased stress to your joints. When walking, be conscious of your knees to avoid hyperextending them.Maintain a slight bend in your knee when walking, especially if you're prone to hyperextending your knee when standing. This will feel strange at first, but eventually your knees will adapt.
Go slowly up stairs, moving in slow and deliberate motions.
Avoid wearing heels too frequently, as this can encourage knee hyperextension.

, To get the greatest health benefits from walking, try to walk at a slightly faster pace than a mere stroll. Strive to walk with quick, not long, steps.


Walking should be in moderate-intensity aerobic activity. This means that youâve broken a sweat and your heart rate has risen.
How can you tell if youâre walking fast enough? You should be able to talk but not sing a song while youâre walking.
Three miles per hour is a good pace if youâre walking to improve your health. If youâre walking to lose weight, pick up the pace to 4 miles in an hour, which is a 15-minute mile.

, Try to build more walking into the course of your regular day whenever possible. If you get into a routine, youâll soon see the steps and health benefits adding up.


Walk to work or part of the way to work if this is possible. Take the stairs when you usually take the elevator. Get up and walk around after you sit for 30 minutes. You can reduce the chronic pain caused by poor ergonomics in the office by walking around for five minutes every 30 minutes. You may be surprised by how much your daily step total will go up by completing a five-minute walk every half hour.
Park your car a ways from your destination so you are forced to walk. Build a regular stroll or walk with friends or family into your day after dinner.
Some people walk around indoor malls or even up and down their companyâs stairs over their lunch hours because they donât have time or money to go to a gym.

, As with any exercise regimen, you might be more likely to quit walking if you try to do too much too soon. You also could strain your muscles. Be patient and work up to longer walks.


Even though walking is a low-impact exercise, your muscles, joints and feet must adjust to new activity levels to avoid soreness and injury. Motivate yourself by remembering that you can burn about 400 calories from a brisk walk, although it takes about 5 miles to do so.
If you want to lose weight, itâs a good idea to also reduce how many calories you eat per day and to eat healthier unprocessed foods. Try to add 2,000 steps into your daily routine when you first start walking. Sometimes you can add steps just by making small lifestyle choices every single day, such as taking the stairs at work when you could take the elevator.
If you donât see weight loss right away, it might be because you are starting to build up muscle, which is good. Be patient, and you will see results over the course of time. Slowly add more steps each week.

, If you prefer to have a few days off during any given week, thatâs fine too. Just aim to walk a total of around 2.5 hours per week.


One benefit of walking is that you donât need a lot of specialized equipment to do it. You can walk wherever you are, even if you are on vacation. You donât need to be in great shape to start doing it.
You can go over the 2.5 hours per week recommendation as you slowly build your endurance for longer distances. The standard official health advice recommends 150 minutes of physical activity a week.All of the fitness advice, although it might vary by a few minutes here or there, consistently recommends the same thing: Walking for several hours a week, however you divide those hours up, has enormous healthy benefits. Eventually, try to walk at least 30 to 45 minutes at a time.

, The number one key to many forms of exercise is consistency. If you walk irregularly or, say, once a month, youâre not going to see a lot of benefits. Make walking something you do regularly.


If you build walking into your regular activities on a daily basis (or at least several times a week), you could see many health benefits. Walking reduces the risk factors that cause heart disease and strokes.Indeed, walking can cut your risk of heart disease by 30 percent. It can also help control the risk of diabetes and cancer. Always check with your doctor before embarking on any new physical activity, especially if you have a medical condition.
Lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and sharper mental acuity are all benefits from regular walking activity, which is a low-cost way to improve your health., Buy a pedometer to track how many steps you walk each day. Many smart phones are able to download free health apps that will also track how many steps youâve taken every day.


Shoot for 10,000 steps a day. Most people already walk between 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day just doing their normal activities, so itâs not that hard to achieve if you consciously try to do it. The Center for Disease Control suggests that at least 7,000 to 8,000 steps is a good threshold for a healthy adult.
Itâs possible to walk about 1,000 steps in 10 minutes. Ten thousand steps is about 5 miles a day.Record your steps every day and figure out your daily and weekly average. The goal is for the average to go up gradually as your endurance increases and you walk more.

, Walking is a very inexpensive form of exercise, but you do need to invest in a decent pair of shoes. Shoes specifically designed for walking are sold, but running and cross training shoes can also work.


Comfortable shoes that provide adequate support while walking are very important. Donât wear shoes that cause blisters.The shoes should have good arch support and thick flexible soles to absorb shock.
Shoes that work for walking should bend through the ball of the feet pretty easily while still being fairly durable. Choose a shoe with a low heel.
High tops are not a great choice for walking unless they are specifically designed for walking or hiking, which a few of them are., Loose-fitting clothing with thin layers will not weigh you down, will reduce the chances of chafing, and will allow you to move comfortably.


Some people choose a loose-fitting T-shirt or tank top and running shorts. Bright colors or reflective tape improve visibility.
Make sure to beware of the sun, depending on season and climate. Wearing sunscreen every day is important to protect your skin from the ravages of the sun. You might also want to wear a sunhat or baseball hat.
Donât forget a jacket if itâs cold or might rain. Make sure that you look at the weather forecast before walking so youâre dressed appropriately for the temperature.

, Walking outside comes with some hazards, so itâs important that you do it safely. Dangers include being hit by a car or tripping on an obstruction.


Watch for traffic and stay observant as you walk, not lost in thought. Walk on sidewalks or on the left side of the street facing traffic if a sidewalk is not available.
Carry your ID, a cell phone, and some change so that you can use a pay phone if you need to do so. Wear reflective gear if you are walking at dusk or night (which can be very dangerous).
Take care when you wear headphones because they will screen out noise that can alert you of dangers. Consider wearing only one head piece in so you can still hear traffic.

, Although walking can be a very relaxing and enjoyable activity, it can also bore you if you do it alone and along the same exact route every day.


Instead, mix up where you walk. Walk around a park, down a riverside path, through woodlands, and down a subdivision road.
Choose a course that isnât filled with cracked sidewalks, potholes or low-hanging tree limbs that could cause injury. Listen to music on an MP3 player as you walk to reduce boredom.
Walk with other people, such as a family member, neighbor or other friend, so as to improve motivation. Itâs also less boring to walk with someone else because you can talk on the way.

, If you live in a cold climate or you donât have a good environment to walk in outside your front door, use a treadmill.


The good thing about a treadmill is that you can set your speed and incline, as if you were walking outside.
If you canât afford to buy a treadmill for your home, many workout centers offer treadmills.
Everything that applies to walking outside generally applies to walking on a treadmill, except that you donât have to worry about traffic or tripping on obstructions in the sidewalk or roads.

Hoop on grass and soft, natural surfaces as much as possible.,
Resist the temptation to use the hoop as a jump rope, or from putting a backspin on the hoop.

,
Occasionally wipe your hoops down with a washcloth and a light dose of ammonia.

,
Keep your hoops away from moisture, as some tapes (gaffer, in particular) can lose their stickiness when wet.

Put yourself first.,
Remember that your mental energy is dependent on your physical energy being in good shape.,
Get the right gear.,
Reflect on the benefits of jogging.,
Don't set yourself up to fail.,
Stay hydrated.,
Deal with pain.,
Be ready for the temperature extremes.,

Get out there.",How to Stop Making Excuses Not to Jog," A principal reason for not exercising is basically not putting yourself at the top of the day's agenda. With jobs, chores, meetings, kids to raise, and studies to complete, there are many obligations clawing at us. And yet, you deserve this quality exercise time and moreover, it is a good idea to start telling yourself that all those people counting on you need you to be in your best condition so that you can actually keep meeting their needs!


Sports psychology consultant Karen Dieffenbach, PhD, says that self-care is at the heart of caring for others and that you need to be a good friend to yourself first by giving yourself this time.Regular exercise brings emotional and physical health to the forefront of your life and increases your ability to cope with situations that confront you daily.;
, This means that the tiredness excuse is often your mental energy speaking; intellectually exhausting work can make your body feel worn out too but the great news is that exercising can rev up the body and reduce the mental tired feelings considerably.Get your blood circulating again and slough off some of that mental exhaustion with a good jog!


One key way to get around feeling tired before you exercise is to give yourself permission to call it quits if you're still feeling very tired after 10 minutes. In this case, you probably are both physically and mentally tired and need to rest properly (get to bed early). However, try your best to do the first 10 minutes before giving in to the feeling of being too tired.
Be prepared to be flexible. Sometimes life will get in the way of your scheduled exercise time. Don't sweat it; simply rearrange for that day or period of time but don't forgo the exercise altogether.

, Part of the jogging experience is looking the part. When you look good and feel comfortable, you're more inclined to feel motivated to get out there and start jogging. Buy a new pair of running shoes and some lightweight, comfortable, and attractive running clothes. Think about how great it will feel to run in these new items and how you can't let them go to waste!


For women, one excuse can be that jogging with large breasts causes pain. The response to this is to get fitted with an excellent sports bra that will support your breasts adequately. A resistant bra made from elastic material will have both support and give. Ask a bra-fitting specialist to get you sorted and you won't have this excuse anymore.
If you don't know what to wear, ask the retailer at the store selling running gear. They'll help you out. Or, check out websites for suitable running gear. The main thing is to wear something comfortable for your body and to have supportive running shoes.

, There are many benefits and they are all worthwhile; keeping the benefits in mind can serve as good motivators especially where you have specific goals in place. To whet your appetite, here are just some of the benefits:


Jogging improves your cardiovascular fitness: This means that your heart, lungs, and vascular system become better at delivering oxygen to your muscles, while your lung capacity improves and you can take in more oxygen with each breath. Ultimately, your muscles benefit and as a result, you will find that you have a reduced likelihood of getting heart disease, increases in endurance ability, and reduced body fat. You will also find increases in your good cholesterol (HDL) levels and reduced risk of cancer.
Jogging reduces your blood pressure: Again, this can help to reduce your risks of heart disease and heart attacks.
Jogging brings improved endurance: When your body is able to use oxygen more efficiently, you will find you have more energy. Thus, the longer you persevere with jogging, the greater your endurance becomes and the longer you can jog (and do other physical activities).
Jogging produces endorphins: You can actually break bad habits like smoking and excessive drinking by replacing them with the habit of jogging, a ""positive addiction"", leaving you happier and healthier.And the ""legal high"" produced by many jogs (not all of them will produce enough endorphins to make you feel great but many will) makes this a rewarding exercise activity.Jogging is fair: Whatever your size, age, or gender, you can jog. Moreover, jogging can increase your self-esteem and confidence through achievement, and it can give you the energy to take up any other sport that interests you.
Jogging relieves stress. Focusing solely on jogging prevents wipes away any other thoughts. It boosts serotonin levels which makes you more relaxed and much more positive. when you focus solely on running, you actually stop thinking about anything else.
Jogging improves your mental health.
Jogging improves your immune system
Jogging is excellent for self-discipline and goal-setting: All forms of running are improved by setting goals and working toward gradual self-improvement. By continuing to practice, you instill good self-discipline and by setting goals for competing against yourself (not against others), you can measure your progress.
Jogging provides you with the opportunity to get outside, see the environment around you, and to spend time doing reflective thinking.
And at the end of a good jog, you have every reason to soak in a hot bath. Finally but importantly, you'll find your sleep much improved., When starting to jog as a beginner or going back to jogging after a break, having too much ambition about where you're planning to get with your jogging can stall it before it even starts. If you're afraid you'll fail because you've set yourself too big a task, recognize that you're sabotaging your chances and pull back to simply trying your best and looking to enjoy the experience. Avoid telling yourself that you think it'll become boring, painful, or too hard; this can become self-fulfilling. Instead, tell yourself that you want to do this because it's fun, it's beneficial, and that you will allow yourself to ease into it gradually and build up over time.


One excuse could easily be that you are disappointed because you can't jog for more than five minutes. Turn this around on itself and ask yourself why you need to jog more than five minutes anyway. For a beginner, five minutes is way better than no minutes! Accept that it's normal to breathe faster and to feel exhausted after only a few minutes when it's all new to you. Instead of panicking and giving it up as bad for you, slow right down and alternate it with an easier pace, including walking. Start small and only do what you can, building up very gradually.
Remember â there is no right or wrong speed to jog and there is nobody monitoring your speed. If you need to jog, walk, jog, walk for weeks or even months until you feel your rhythm kick in, so be it. Don't sweat it, just be sure to persevere.

, It is important to drink water before, during, and after your jogging activity. You will sweat a lot when you begin to jog and water will replenish what you lose. If you don't replenish it, your muscles feel fatigued and you'll feel tired.Buy a comfortable and convenient water vessel that you can wear easily as you jog.

, Pain is a major source of dissuasion from any activity in life, jogging included. It is important to source the reason for pain and deal with it adequately so that you can remove this excuse from the list. Some reasons for pain might include:


You're not warming up enough before jogging. Warming-up stretches will help to flex your muscles and prevent you from harming them as you jog. Be sure to warm up and warm down prior to and after jogging.
Stay adequately hydrated. As outlined above, keeping your liquids up is important; muscles that are fatigued will cause you painful responses.
A deep pain in your chest after jogging may indicate that you're not eating enough or you're eating too much, or that you're not breathing correctly during the workout. Try to eat a banana or have a glass of juice half an hour before working out. During jogging, pay attention to each breath and breath regularly and deeply.
Hurting knees can happen where your muscles are under too much pressure. Stretch for ten minutes before jogging.
Your feet hurt. This could be a sign that your shoes are not comfortable and are not providing enough cushioning. Look for a more comfortable pair and make sure that they fit properly.

, If one of your excuses is that it's too hot or too cold to go jogging, it's important to work around that as much as possible, to ensure you're still getting out there and doing so safely.


If it's hot outside, wear appropriate clothing that wicks away the sweat and have plenty of water to keep you hydrated. Avoid jogging in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest. You may need to adjust your schedule to find the coolest part of the day. Don't push yourself too hard and obviously, steer clear of jogging on really hot days.
If it's cold outside, and there's ice all over the roads: Too bad! Scope out a trail where there is very little to no ice, and dress up in warm lightweight jogging clothes. If not, jog back and forth on a section of trail that is ice free or even make your own jogging trail in the backyard.

, With a little motivation from another living being, anything is possible. Your jogging partner can be a relative (brother, sister, mother, father), a friend, a coworker, or a neighbor. You might even want to jog with your dog. Find someone or some being who can motivate you and in turn you can motivate them, and be determined to enjoy yourselves.


If your kids have become an excuse for why you're not getting out there, bring them along. Put them in the buggy and push, or choose a space where you can jog around them while keeping an eye on them if they're too young to jog too. The repetitive nature of jogging in circles is worth it when the kids are in the outdoors with you, seeing you exercising. When they're old enough to jog, have them join in. Also, have a spouse or friend tag-team if you both want to jog - share the child-care arrangement in turns while the other jogs.
Use time spent waiting for kids at sports to do your own exercise. Circle their sports field as many times as time permits.

, The biggest excuse is that you feel overwhelmed. All the above excuses have responses. For the feeling of being overwhelmed, the answer is always action. Just make yourself get out there and do a little something. You will be much happier with yourself if you actually make the attempt and it's more than likely that once you've hurdled your mental state of confusion, the jogging will restore clarity and you'll be able to keep going with the feeling that you're glad you made the effort after all.


Accept that there will be good days and bad days when jogging. Not all runs will end in a high; some will probably leave you feeling crotchety and ready for bed. However, in the overall scheme of things, it's likely that your jogging experience will be good to great more times than not, and this balances out the less desirable days. You can say the same about most of your daily activities, so it's important to be accepting. Moreover, by being consistent, you allow yourself the room to have sluggish days without throwing in the towel; slow down but don't give up.
Every new jog is a new experience. That's part of the fun and adventure and can also be part of what surprises you as a beginner. Expect it and it'll be easier for you to understand when things don't go according to what you'd hoped.
Schedule time by putting it in your diary. Have the time beep, leap out at you, or interrupt you â do whatever works to remind you!

Get some comfortable shoes.,
Wear reflective clothing.,
Wear white.,
Bring water and a snack, if desired.,
Wear layers if it is chilly.,
Use a pedometer.,
Use a headlamp or flashlight.",How to Walk for Exercise at Night1," Although you can walk in other kinds of shoes, a good pair of sneakers can help to make your evening walks more comfortable. A good pair of walking shoes will provide adequate levels of lift in the arch, as well as ankle support. Good shoes will help you get the most out of your walk.If you already have a pair of shoes you enjoy walking about in, then you can just keep wearing them.
If you think you need a new pair of shoes, or want to start going on longer walks at night, visit your local sporting goods store. Talk to a shoe specialist and ask for their help finding shoes that are appropriate for walking at night, such as a pair with reflective material on the heels and sides.;
, Reflective clothing can help you to stay safe on your walks. If youâre wearing reflective clothing, you will be more easily seen by drivers and other pedestrians. This will keep both you and others safe.Your reflective clothing should cover your back, front, shoes, and sides.


You can easily purchase reflective bands, vests, and hats at most sporting goods stores.

, Light colors tend to stand out more against the darkness of night than dark clothing. So in addition to wearing reflective clothing, choose white clothing. If you donât have any white clothes, wear something bright. Bright red, neon green, and orange will help drivers and pedestrians see you better. , It is always a good idea to bring water along with you when you are exercising. If youâre headed out on a long walk, carry a water bottle with you and a snack as well. A small snack like a granola bar or trail mix can help you stay energized on a long walk. Water will keep you hydrated. This is especially important when youâre walking on a hot summer night.If you are going for short walk and you feel hungry, then try having a small snack before you head out, such as a piece of fruit or a small granola bar.
You can also go for a walk after eating dinner to improve your digestion.

, Layering means wearing multiple thin clothing items that you can easily remove if necessary. You might overestimate how cold it is outside, or find that once you get up to speed on your walk, youâre warmer than you thought you would be. If youâre wearing layers, you can (for instance) remove your jacket. If youâre still warm, you could remove your sweater.A good way to layer is to wear a t-shirt, a long-sleeved shirt, a thin sweater, and a light jacket.
If you have a backpack with you when you walk for exercise at night, stuff your excess layers in the backpack. You could also pack a sweater or hoodie in the backpack in case you anticipate getting cold.

, A pedometer is a small device that measures how many steps you take. If youâre trying to track how far youâre walking at night for exercise, investing in a pedometer is a helpful tool to do so. Some pedometers also have calorie counters and mile/kilometer counters as well.For the ultimate experience in tracking your own biological information, invest in a FitBit or similar fitness tracking device. These devices provide information on not just how many steps you took and how far youâve walked, but also on your heart rate, blood pressure, and calories burned.

, If you donât have many streetlights near you, or if youâre walking a woodland trail, bring a flashlight or strap on a hands-free headlamp. Having a portable light will help you see where youâre going when walking for exercise at night."

Look for high-traffic areas.,
Walk indoors.,
Find a nighttime walking event.,
Stick to a well-lit path.,
Stay on the sidewalk.,
Take a route you know.",How to Walk for Exercise at Night2," Footpaths and established trails that attract a lot of walkers, bikers, and runners are the best option for walking at night. This way, youâll always have someone nearby.


High-traffic areas, in this context, refers to high numbers of pedestrians. Areas with abundant automobile traffic, however, should be avoided.
If you donât have any high-traffic walking areas, buddy up with a friend or bring your dog along for the walk. Not only is there safety in numbers, but sharing a walk with a friend is great fun.Alternately, you could walk through neighborhoods where you know people.

, Walking inside is a great option if the weather is bad or if the temperature is too cold. If you have a treadmill, you can walk for exercise whenever you want. If you donât have a treadmill, you could visit a gym and use one there. Alternately, find an open space within your own home to walk at night. Walking up and down your stairs, for instance, is a great way to challenge yourself and get a good workout., Many major organizations and nonprofits sponsor night walks for a variety of important causes. For instance, you might be able to find nighttime walking events to support leukemia, lymphoma, and other cancers. Check your communityâs local events calendar online or browse your local newspaperâs event listings for information about nighttime walking events near you., Youâll have a much better time walking if you can see where youâre going. If your path is poorly lit, you might step on sharp objects or broken glass. You might stumble on rocks or an uneven sidewalk. Walking in areas that have streetlights also makes it easier for other people to see if you need help.Look for paths that are not only well-lit, but have regular lighting. In other words, try not to trace a path that leads from a brightly lit street with many open businesses and lots of vehicular traffic to a street that has only a few street lights. It takes your eyes time to adjust to these different levels of lighting.

, The sidewalk is there for a reason. Walking in the road means youâre closer to auto traffic and therefore in greater danger. The sidewalk is reserved for pedestrians like you. Use the sidewalk when walking for exercise at night.If you have to walk in the street â for instance, if the sidewalk ends â walk against oncoming traffic.

, If you walk a route youâre used to, youâll know it backwards and forwards and even if there are hazards, youâll know right where they are. New routes that you havenât walked before, though, present new challenges.This is not to say you should exclusively walk the same trail every time you walk for exercise at night. In fact, you should try to vary your route from time to time in order to avoid becoming bored.But if you want to try a new trail, give it a test run during the day before trying it at night.

Start slowly.,
Assess your fitness level.,
Assume the proper walking form.,
Slow your pace as you near your destination.,
Build yourself up.",How to Walk for Exercise at Night3," When you begin walking, you might want to walk at only a moderate pace for about 10 to 15 minutes each night. You donât need to walk continuously when accruing this time. You could, for instance, walk to the store for seven or eight minutes, do some shopping, then walk home over another seven or eight minutes., Assessing your fitness level is especially important before walking for exercise at night if you are sedentary or have health issues. The easiest way to assess your fitness level is to see a doctor. Your doctor can tell you what your physical capabilities and limits are based on your age, weight, health, and lifestyle., Walking for fitness requires you to keep your head up, back straight, and eyes forward. Keep your arms relaxed at your sides. You can pump them a little, but donât clench them too close to your body. Tighten your stomach slightly but keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.Donât lift your feet like a marching soldier. Instead, roll your foot off the ground from the heel to the toes.

, Once you get close to the end of your walking route, slow your pace slightly. Walk slowly for the last five minutes of your walk. This will help your muscles relax and provide a brief cooldown period.Once you arrive at home, do a few simple stretches. For instance, rotate your neck and tilt your head from side to side. Bend down and try to touch your toes. Put your right arm over your head and tilt your body to the left. Hold the pose for 20 seconds, then repeat on the opposite side.

, As you improve your pace and become more familiar with your route, you could increase the benefits you gain from walking. For instance, you could walk faster if your goal is to burn more calories. You could also extend your route and walk for a longer time each night. Walking for a longer period will also burn more calories compared to walking for a shorter period.Never push yourself too hard or increase speed at the cost of personal safety.
Aim to walk at least 10,000 steps each day.

"
Look out for tripping hazards.,
Listen to your surroundings.,
Use caution near vehicles.,
Cross only at crosswalks.",How to Walk for Exercise at Night4," You might encounter any number of obstacles on your walking path. While these are easy to see in daylight, they become more difficult to see at night. Keep your eyes focused on the path in front of you to avoid injuring yourself due to a nasty spill. Some of the most obvious hazards you might encounter include:roots
rocks
uneven sidewalks
potholes
bikes laying on the sidewalk
trash bags or containers

, Even though youâre walking at night, there are many sounds that you should listen for to stay safe. Cars might honk if you step into the road carelessly. Runners might warn you theyâre coming up behind you. Hearing these audio cues can keep you and others safe, so listen up when walking â day or night.Listen for animals, especially when walking in a rural area.
Avoid using headphones. If you really want to listen to something, put only one earbud in and keep the volume low.
Try bringing some emergency equipment along with you like a whistle, pepper spray, phone, and flashlight or flashlight app.

, If youâre struck by an automobile while on foot, you could be seriously injured. Therefore, itâs important to limit your risk for auto accidents while walking for exercise at night. Important steps you can take to limit your likelihood of being hurt include:Walk against traffic if youâre walking in the road. In other words, walk on the side of the street where cars are headed toward you. This will allow you to better see and react to vehicles.
Always look both ways before crossing the street. Stop and look up both ways before stepping onto a roadway. Even if you have the walk signal, look both ways. Many drivers barrel through red lights.

, Jaywalking is dangerous. Most pedestrian deaths â 78% â occur outside street intersections. Always cross the street at a designated crosswalk. Wait for the pedestrian crossing signal to turn on before heading across. It might require patience and be inconvenient, but itâs also safe.If thereâs no crosswalk signal at the crosswalk, look both ways before heading across.

, If this is the first time you've walked for this sort of trip, it will help to plan your route.

, Walking is slow and requires some effort, compared to other modes of transportation.

, Online maps or GPS may be able to help. Try for relatively quiet streets with sidewalks, if you have the choice. Lighting is a plus, if you will be walking in low light or darkness.

, If you live in the place, you may already know which areas these are. If you are new, or are not certain, try to ask someone who is local to the area.

, If this is your first walking trip, or your first walking trip in a new area or on a new route, allow extra time, in case the trip takes longer than intended. Remember, it can take a lot of extra time to correct if you make a wrong turn or have to detour around an unexpected obstacle on foot.

, You may get quite warm as you get going, because walking is good exercise.


Layers are a good choice. If you get too warm or cold, you can add or remove layers.
Take along an umbrella or other rain gear if needed.
Wear comfortable, movable clothing that fits well.

, If you normally wear dress shoes at the office or elsewhere, you may want to leave them there or carry them with you. The right shoes will make walking comfortable and will not disintegrate when you really walk in them.-

, Dark clothes don't show up well on in low light or darkness. Better choices include reflectors or reflective materials and light or brightly-colored clothing.


Look for bags, jackets, shoes, and hats with reflectors built in, so that it is effortless to use them. Carry lights with you if you will be out at night.
Remember that motorists may be looking through windshield glare or dirt. If you're not sure, go for extra visibility.

, For a workout or exercise walk, ID and a water bottle may be all you need. For a day at the office, you may need more. Keep the items carried to a minimum, because every additional item adds weight to your load and complexity to your life. Both will tend to slow you down.

, You may not have an easy trip to go get something you omitted to bring. Use a checklist, mnemonic, or ""launch pad"" strategy to make sure you take what you needâno less, no more.

, Make way for other pedestrians and groups you may meet. If the sidewalk is crowded, keep with the pace of traffic. Stay to one side if you are going slower than everyone else.

,


Keep alert for motorists and bicyclists. Remember that you may not be able to hear a bicyclist until he/she is very close.
In many places, bicycle traffic should not be on the sidewalk, but it is a frequently broken rule. If you do encounter bicycles on the footpath, avoid making sudden moves. They will most often go around you.
Motor traffic should definitely not be on the sidewalk, but it will cross driveways. Look for it before crossing these places.
Do not walk out suddenly from behind or between parked cars.

Cross streets safely.
When practicable, make eye contact with motorists before crossing their paths. Many motorists will acknowledge a wave or nod, so that you are certain they have seen you and agree to wait for you to cross.

, Giving the appearance of taking command of your space may help with keeping a pace; deterring panhandlers, salespeople, and would-be thieves; and being visible and getting your turn when you encounter motorists and others.


Face forward and keep your head up. Use your eyes to scan the ground, if you need to keep watch for broken or missing pavement. Look side to side if you need to.

Choose a route that includes an incline, uneven terrain, or stairs.,
Commit to walking at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week.Results won't be instant, and when you're doing moderate exercise (instead of high-intensity exercise, like running), you'll need to exercise for longer periods of time and more frequently.Try going for a walk during your lunch break at work.,
Find a friend to walk with you.,
Start slow and stay safe.,
Squeeze your butt cheeks periodically as you walk.,
Add a walking lunge to your routine.,
Incorporate squats into your walk.,
Set the treadmill on an incline.,
Try interval training to burn more calories without reducing muscle mass.,
Walk backwards on the treadmill to engage your glutes.",How to Tone the Butt With Walking," The unfortunate truth is that simply walking on level ground is not going to to fully engage your gluteal muscles. If you're walking on a track, in the mall, or somewhere that is completely flat, you will still reap the many benefits of walking, but you won't be working the muscles in your butt enough to really firm it up.Scope out your neighborhood for hilly areas where you might walk. Look at nearby parks and hiking trails, which might be more likely to have a varied landscape.
If you live somewhere completely flat, consider walking up and down the stairs in your office building or home several times a week.
If that's too boring, look for bridges with staircases where you can walk up and down, stadiums, or buildings or monuments with tons of stairs out front (think of the ""Rocky Steps"" that Sylvester Stallone runs up in the Rocky movies).
Walking up stairs, even at a slow pace, can burn calories two- to three-times faster than walking on a level surface.Even if you're not fully engaging your glutes, one of the benefits of walking regularly can be weight loss. Your backside might start to look better simply from walking and losing weight.;
,
You can break up your 30 minutes throughout the day. You can walk for three 10-minute intervals if that makes it easier for you make walking part of your routine., Ask a friend or coworker to join you on your walks. You should be able to carry on a conversation when engaging in moderate-intensity exercise, so you can chat with your workout buddy and keep from getting bored while you exercise.Having a partner to hold you accountable can make it easier for you to stick to your walking regimen.If you're new to the area or can't find anyone else interested in walking, search for a walking club in your area that you can join., Staying safe while walking means having shoes that are comfortable and provide adequate support, talking to your doctor about reasonable goals (especially if you haven't exercised in a long time or have health issues), stretching before and after your walk, and staying alert to traffic and other hazards.


Don't jump into an intense walking schedule if you haven't exercised in a while. Maybe start out on a level terrain and work your way up to an incline or stairs. Increase your stamina and avoid injury from overuse.Try not to go for walks alone when it's dark out, either late at night or very early in the morning, when you might not be as aware of your surroundings or visible to traffic.

, Tightening and releasing your butt will get your glutes more engaged in your workout. Try squeezing your butt for several 10-second intervals during your walk.Don't keep your glutes tightened for the entire duration of your walk. Clenching your cheeks for long periods of time can change how you walk and lead to hip and back pain., After walking for five minutes, switch to walking lunges, doing 25 reps per leg. Lunges improve your balance, stretch your muscles, and work your legs and butt. Just make sure you keep proper form so you don't injure your knees or lower back.








Begin with your feet hip-distance apart. You can place your hands on your hips for balance, or do whatever feels comfortable.
Take one huge step forward, planting your foot firmly in front of you.
Lower your body, bending your knees to a 90 degree angle (or 45 degree if you're just starting out). Don't extend your front knee past your toes â your knee should always be right above your foot.
Bring your back leg forward and rise again to a standing position. Then repeat the lunge with the opposite leg.

, Squats are considered one of the best, most effective workouts for a shapely rear. You should practice them at home to get comfortable and master the correct form before trying a walking squat. You want to make sure you sink your hips, keep your back straight, and stick your butt out behind you so you don't injure your knees.








Start with your feet together. Step out to the side with your dominant foot (you will be moving laterally, so if you are walking down a path you may want to turn to the side, leading with your dominant foot).
Slowly lower your hips, making sure your knees don't extend past your toes.
Rise back into a standing position, bringing your nondominant foot in next to your dominant foot.
Do 12 reps. Your squats will carry you sideways, with your dominant foot leading. Make sure you perform the exercise on both sides, alternating leading with your dominant and nondominant foot.

, Striding uphill, against the force of gravity, will force your legs and butt to work harder.Walking on an incline can also be easier on your knees.After warming up, increase the incline on the treadmill every few minutes until you reach a 10% incline.Your legs, butt, and lungs should feel challenged, but not exhausted. If you are unable to talk, lower the incline. If you have enough breath to sing, raise the incline higher.

, Steady cardio can actually lead to muscle loss, which is not what you want when you're trying to tone and shape your butt. Interval training means you alternate between periods of sprinting and walking, but it can be adapted for just walking, too.Try applying intervals to inclines. Set the incline to 8% and hold on to the handles, digging your heels into the treadmill and lifting your knees. It should feel like you're dragging yourself through the mud.After one or two minutes, go back to a 1% incline and rest for a minute.
To practice intervals without sprints, walk at a slow pace for 90 seconds. Then increase the speed to a quick walk, but not a run or jog, and do that for 30-60 seconds. Then go back to your slower pace for another 90 seconds, and so on.

, Pay close attention to what you're doing so you don't fall and walk at a slower pace than you're used to.Walking backwards expends more calories and makes your glutes and hamstrings work harder than walking forwards.Because walking backwards on a treadmill is risky, make sure you are not overtired when you try it. Start with the treadmill on the slowest setting, then increase speed slowly once you feel comfortable.
Set your treadmill on an incline for an additional challenge, or alternate between walking forwards and backwards to keep your workout interesting.

Walk in the shade.,
Walk somewhere with a breeze.,
Schedule your hot weather walk carefully.,
Give yourself time to acclimate.",How to Stay Cool on Hot Weather Walks1," Instead of walking on the sunny side of the street, walk along the side of the street that provides tree cover. Alternately, take a hot weather walk in the woods of your nearest public park, where tree cover keeps temperatures low.If shade is available only intermittently along your walking path, rest beneath patches of trees or other sources of shade to cool down, at least temporarily.;
, Walking next to a lake, along the beach by the ocean, or on a higher elevation may be cooler because there is often a breeze in these places. If you have some options about where you go walking, opt for someplace that is more likely to be breezy.

, Going out for a hot weather walk doesnât require that you walk during the hottest part of the day. Walk in the evening or early morning (close to dawn) to prevent walking during the hottest part of the day.The hottest part of the day is usually between 3:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon.Check your local forecast before heading out. If your local temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) or above, exercise caution and keep your weather walk brief. If your local temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or more, many healthcare experts would advise against going on a hot weather walk.

, Take it easy when exercising in hot weather, especially if you do not typically walk or work out in hot weather. Start slowly at first, and gradually increase the intensity and speed of your walk.If you do typically walk or workout, but not in heat, adopt a slower-than-usual pace when out on a hot weather walk. Increase your speed after a few minutes if you feel up to it.
The amount of time needed to acclimate to hot weather varies from person to person. Hot weather walks will feel uncomfortable, but if you get dizzy, nauseous, or fatigued, slow your pace or consider ending your hot weather walk.

Drink plenty of water.,
Walk from fountain to fountain.,
Dress properly.,
Remove layers.,
Fan your face.,
Wet your body with water.,
Use a cold pack.",How to Stay Cool on Hot Weather Walks2," Drinking water â especially cold water â can lower your body temperature and keep you cool during hot weather walks. Fill a water bottle with ice cubes and pour water over it. Take it with you on your hot weather walk and sip from it regularly.In hot weather, drink water even when youâre not thirsty to prevent dehydration. Take a sip (five ounces, or 150 milliliters) at least once every 10 to 15 minutes.Drink at least 16 ounces (500 milliliters) of water one or two hours prior to your hot weather walk. Drink the same volume 15 minutes before heading out.If youâre planning on a particularly vigorous hot weather walk, bring a sports drink along, too. Sports drinks like Gatorade can help you replenish sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. that you lose through sweating.
Do not drink juices or soda, as they contain high levels of sugar that wonât be readily absorbed during your hot weather walk.

, If youâre at a public park or on a walking course, water fountains might be located at regular intervals along the path. If this is the case, stop and sip from them as you walk. This will help you preserve the water in your bottle, which you might use quickly depending on the temperature outside and the length of your hot weather walk., When taking a hot weather walk, wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing.Avoid dark colors, as they absorb more heat. Wear a wide-brimmed hat if possible.When looking for hats, look for lightweight, mesh fabric around the scalp with a brim that covers the forehead and back of neck. The hat should also be made from breathable material that allows perspiration to quickly escape.
Select clothes made from synthetic moisture-wicking fabrics instead of cotton, which retains sweat and can cause discomfort.

, If you have layered clothing on, remove excess layers. Place them in your bag or just carry them by hand. For example, if youâre on a hot weather walk and youâre wearing a sweater, remove it and roll it up. Carry it by hand or throw it over your shoulder., There are several options for fanning your face during your hot weather walk. You could use a folding fan to blow air over your face. Just unfold the fan and move it back and forth using rapid wrist motions (either up-and-down or side-to-side) rapidly to increase the air flow near your face. Alternately, you could bring a handheld electric fan. These are usually powered by a battery and can fit easily in a bag or fanny pack.

, Bring a water bottle with you on your hot weather walk. Use it to squirt, pour, or sprinkle a bit of water on your face, head, and the back of your neck. Allow the water to trickle down your back. As it evaporates, it will cool you., Cold packsÂ , bags of ice, or even wet towels are great for staying cool on hot weather walks. Cold packs can be frozen before your hot weather walk begins, then kept in a bag or fanny pack until youâre ready to use it. Some cold packs donât need to be frozen ahead of time, but instead become cold when youâre ready to use them through an endothermic (cold-creating) chemical reaction.Always use your cold packsÂ  as directed.
If you donât want to invest in a special cold packÂ , you can just throw a handful of ice cubes in a resealable plastic bag or wet a small hand towel with cold water. Wrapping a wet towel around your neck is a great way to stay cool. Or, you can also wet a bandanna and refrigerate or freeze it and then wrap it around the back of your head and neck to stay cool.
Remember, as you continue your hot weather walk, the cold packÂ  or ice bag will become warmer.

Use sunscreen.,
Know your own fitness level.,
Stay on the lookout for heat-related illness.",How to Stay Cool on Hot Weather Walks3," Ensure you wear sunscreen with strength of at least 30 SPF. Look for a sunscreen that has both UVA and UVB protection. Cover your face, nose, neck, arms, and shoulders. These are the areas most exposed to the sun and the areas that tend to burn most easily. If your chest or back are exposed, cover them with an even coat of sunscreen, too.Avoid scented sunscreens, as they attract bugs.Additionally, wear sunglasses. Protecting your eyes is extremely important no matter the weather. Choose sunglasses that offer 99% or greater UV protection., Do not push yourself beyond what you can manage. If youâre new at exercising, or if you exercise only irregularly, keep your hot weather walk brief. For instance, you might have a ten-minute hot weather walk to gauge your fitness level. If you feel fine throughout the walk, you could increase your hot weather walk to 15 minutes the next time around.Keep in mind that your hydration level will greatly affect how you feel before and after your walk.


Continue to add time to your hot weather walk in five-minute increments up to a time limit you feel is adequate and safe.
Factor your own health and medical history into your decision to head out for a hot weather walk. For instance, if you have a medical condition that is exacerbated by hot weather (such as heart failure), or are taking medication (like diuretics) that could put you at greater risk for a heat-related illness, avoid hot weather walks.Talk to your doctor if you are unsure about the relationship between hot weather walks and your medication or medical history.
If you believe you have any reason to be concerned about taking a hot weather walk, stay indoors.
Take a rest under some shady trees or head home if you feel you cannot complete the full circuit youâd planned on walking.

, Despite your best attempts to stay hydrated and dress properly, you may still succumb to the heat. Learn the signs and symptoms of too much heat exposure to know when your body needs respite. There are several heat-related illnesses that may afflict you if you fail to stay cool on hot weather walks. Common heat-related illnesses include:Heat exhaustion. If you suffer from heat exhaustion, you might experience nausea, vomiting, headache, fainting, thirst, or feelings of general weakness. Your skin may become cold, pale, and clammy.Heatstroke. Heatstroke occurs when heat exhaustion is left untreated. Youâll experience all the symptoms of heat exhaustion, plus a few additional symptoms. Your skin will be hot and your heart might be racing. You may or may not sweat. Seek medical attention immediately if you have heatstroke.
Heat cramps - Heat cramps cause the muscle to contract painfully. Your body temperature might remain normal and your muscles might feel tense or firm.
Heat syncope and exercise-associated collapse â Heat syncope causes feelings of lightheadedness or fainting in high temperatures. This is unlikely to affect you during hot weather walks, since it tends to occur after standing for a long period of time. A related condition, exercise-associated collapse, also causes feelings of lightheadedness or fainting, but you are more likely to experience it because it tends to strike after exercising (such as after vigorous walking).

Evaluate your need for a gait test.,
Gather the right materials.,
Look for an appropriate place to walk.,
Measure out your walking course.,
Set up the gait speed course.",How to Measure Your Gait Speed1," Not everyone will need to measure their gait speed. Generally, this test is reserved for those that are suspected to have difficulty walking or have difficulty balancing.For most people, a gait speed test won't be overly beneficial. This is especially true if you have no health conditions or any difficulty walking.
For example, a 15 year old that plays sports, has no current health issues and no obvious difficulty walking, will most likely not benefit from a gait test. However, an 80 year old that's recovering from a hip fracture will most definitely need a gait test.
Do not try to measure your gait speed or measure someone else's gait speed that requires physical assistance.Also, do not test someone's gait speed if they have significant shortness of breath.;
, Although many hospitals and physical therapist test gait speed as part of normal protocol, it's easy enough to perform a gait test at home. Gait tests are easy to perform and require little to no equipment. This makes it a perfect test to repeat over time if you need to continuously measure your gait.The first thing you'll need is a stop watch. Since gait speed is based on time, you'll need to time yourself with either a regular watch or stop clock.
It's best if you can have someone else with you to watch the stop clock or watch. This is especially true if you have difficulty walking. It might be hard to walk, while looking down at a clock.
You'll also need a measuring tape. You'll need to measure out the appropriate distance of which you'll be walking.

, Remember, testing gait speed is generally reserved for those that have difficulty walking. You need to find an area to walk that's safe for this test.The most important part of the gait test, is finding a walking path that's flat and free of debris. A side walk, pavement or turf is a great place.
Try to avoid grass paths, hiking paths, or a path that either goes uphill or downhill. This will affect the ability of the person to walk and also affect their results.

, Although the main method of testing gait speed is the same, there are a variety of distances that you choose to test. Choose the distance that best works for you or the patient.Gait tests vary in their distance. It can be as short as 4 meters or as long as 10 or 20 meters.
If you are just recovering from an injury or have a significant difficulty walking, a shorter gait test is best.
If you have been working on improving your gait speed, you may be able to try a 10 or 20 meter test.
You may be able to progress to a longer gait test if your physician or physical therapist finds it appropriate and safe.

, After you've determined the best place to conduct your gait test, set up the course. This will require you to measure out specific distances and put out markers.


Measure out your desired gait test distance. For example, measure out a 10 meter walking area.
In addition, measure out a 5 foot starting area and a 5 foot finishing area.The purpose of the starting and finishing area is to allow the person to build up speed to either their comfortable or maximal gait speed.
In this example, you'd need to set up cones or some sort of marker at the beginning and end of the 10 meter walking area. This is the area where you start and end the timer.

Measure your comfortable gait speed.,
Attempt a maximal gait speed test.,
Calculate gait speed.,
Determine if your gait speed is within normal limits.,
Evaluating your gait speed.",How to Measure Your Gait Speed2," When you measure your gait speed, there are two different speeds you can measure. The first and most common speed is your ""comfortable"" or normal gait speed.Comfortable gait speed is when you perform this test when you're walking at a normal pace.
You shouldn't be walking faster or slower than normal. It's a comfortable pace for you.
Start walking and have someone begin timing you at the start of the first marker or cone. Walk normally until you get past the second cone. Stop the timer just as you pass the marker of the end of the walking area.
To get the most accurate results, its perform this test 3 times. Then, record those results and take the average.

, The maximal gait speed test will measure your fastest walking speed. It's generally reserved for those that have been working on improving their speed.


Unlike the comfortable gait speed test, the maximal gait speed test is designed to see how fast you can walk safely. For example, how fast you can cross a street.Although the speed will be different for this test, the method of testing is identical to the comfortable gait speed test.
Begin walking and build up speed during the initial starting area. This way, you are walking as fast as you can when you're in the timed walking area.
You can slow down once you have past the second marker and are in the finishing area. Again, repeat this test three times.

, To calculate your gait speed, there is a simple equation that you input your data and information. It's simple to use and will give you a fairly accurate result.


Before calculating your actual gait speed, take the average of your three results. Add up each of your 3 results and then divide by three. This will give you your average result.
The equation for gait speed is: total distance / time.For example, if you did a 10 meter gait speed test and it took you 7 seconds, the equation would like: 10 meters / 7 seconds = 1.4 meters per second.

, Once you have your gait speed results, you can compare these to standards or normal limits of other people your age and gender.


For men between the ages of 60-70, your gait speed should be around 1.26 meters per second. Women of this age group should have a gait speed of 1.24 meters per second.For men and women between the ages of 70-80 years old, your gait speed should be 1.25 meters per second.
For men between the ages of 80-90 your gait speed will decrease to around 0.88 meters per second, while women of the same age group should have a gait speed of .80 meters per second.
Men and women over 90 years old should will generally notice another decline in gait speed to around .70 meters per second.

, Once you've compared your gait speed to averages, you can determine whether or not you need assistance improving your gait speed.


If you've calculated your gait speed and it's at or faster than the normal limits for your age and gender, you're considered normal and have an acceptable gait speed.
If your gait speed is below what's considered normal, consider speaking to a doctor or physical therapist for help.
Make sure to compare your gait speed to the right normative values. Although age and gender are important, you also need to factor in health conditions. There are specific gait speeds for those that have strokes, hip fractures, multiple sclerosis, lower limb amputation, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.

Talk to a physical therapist.,
Start resistance training.,
Supplement your exercise routine with aerobic exercise.,
Consider training in rhythm with music.",How to Measure Your Gait Speed3," If you've taken a gait speed test and notice that your gait speed is not normal, you might benefit from speaking to your physician or a physical therapist.


Gait speed is not just an indicator of how fast you can walk. It's an indicator of how many body systems are responding and functioning. If you have an abnormal gait speed, it's worth speaking to your doctor about.
Just because your gait speed is below normal, doesn't mean you cannot improve. Your physician may recommend that you get regular physical therapy. This will help you build strength, coordination and endurance.

, Improving gait speed is not based on continued aerobic exercise. In fact, one of the best ways to improve gait speed is by incorporating regular and consistent resistance training.One exercise you can try are chair sits. Start by sitting on a sturdy chair - it shouldn't be soft or reclining. Without using momentum or your arms, stand up to an upright position. Then slowly sit back down without using your hands. Repeat 10 times if possible.
Also try calf raises. While standing in front of a sturdy backed chair, slowly press up through your heels until your are on your tip toes. You may need to hold on the back of the chair for support. Repeat 10 times if able.
In addition, you can try step ups. Find a step - either on a stair case or use an aerobic step. If you cannot step up very high, a low aerobic step is best. Hold on to a railing or another person for support and step up with one foot. Bring your other foot to meet it on the step. Then step back down. Repeat about 10 times with each leg.

, Although resistance training seems to be the biggest determinant in whether or not you improve your gait speed, it' still important to include aerobic training.Aerobic exercise in particular, improves endurance and will help increase the length of time you can walk.
It's important to start with low intensity exercises - like walking - and slowly working up to higher intensities over time.
While you're walking, you can try: practicing walking over objects, walking both forwards and backwards, walking while you carry light weight objects or alternating speeds of walking.

, In addition to resistance training and some balance training, studies have also found that exercise in rhythm, especially when listening to music, there were improved results in gait speed.These studies showed that participants who walked or danced in time with music had better long-term results compared to the control groups.
If you are working on improving your gait speed, consider finding music that has a steady and slow beat.
Over time, work on walking to a faster beat to help you improve your gait speed.

Plan a route.,
Go immediately after you eat.,
Wear the proper shoes.,
Walk for fifteen minutes.,
Repeat after every meal.",How to Take a Walk After Meals1," Think about where you want to walk after you meal. This should be a path that is immediately outside of your door. You might walk around your neighborhood, stroll around the block of your office, or visit a local park.


Set a goal for yourself when you plan your route by identifying a local landmark you want to reach. For example, you might decide to walk to the mailbox down the street and back.
You can use an app or website like Map My Walk or Plot a Route to plan new walking routes in your area.;
, Walking immediately after a meal will prevent your blood sugar from spiking, which can reduce the sleepiness you may feel after you eat. Instead of waiting after a meal, take your walk as soon as you finish.If you have heart disease, you may want to wait half an hour to an hour before walking.Some people may cramp easily if they exercise after a meal. If you start cramping, try waiting fifteen or thirty minutes before you start walking.

, Put on a pair of comfortable sneakers, trainers, or walking shoes. A comfortable pair of walking shoes can help protect your joints and your feet as you walk. Good walking shoes should fit your feet well while providing support to your whole foot.


The insole (the bottom of the inside of the shoe) and the heel collar (which rests against your heel and ankle) should both be cushioned.
The bottom of the shoe, or outsole, should have grooves and treads so that you can maintain traction in all weather.Waterproof shoes or boots may be useful if you live in a wet or snowy climate.

, Fifteen minutes is all you need to reap the benefits of a post-meal walk. You can time your walk on your phone or fitness tracker.If youâre having difficulty walking for fifteen minutes, you can start with five minutes. Add a minute or two every day until you can walk for fifteen minutes.
If your route takes you less than fifteen minutes, you might loop back around it.
If a fifteen minute walk is too easy, once a day you can walk for up to thirty minutes.

, A short walk after every meal will maximize your benefits. It may even be better than a longer walk at the end of the day. Try to fit a walk into your schedule after every meal.If this is difficult to do, you might aim for walking after at least two meals, such as breakfast and dinner.

This can minimize your risk for injury, maximize your workouts, and prevent you from being disqualified during competitions.Consider doing a local workshop or watching a video of proper technique to boost your knowledge of race walking. Working with a professional race walker may provide you with insider tips on maximizing your performance.;
, Keeping your body properly positioned can help maximize your race walking performance. The most optimal posture for race walking is holding your head and body in an upright position with your hips directly underneath you.Let any leaning while you walk come from your ankles. Leaning from your waist can prevent you from rolling your hips, which is a key component of race walking.
Keep your neck and face muscles relaxed.

, Keep your toes pointing forward, and your ankles, knees and hips in the same vertical plane. This will allow you to maintain proper posture in your hips and knees, which can maximize your stride and minimize the risk of injury. It also sets your legs up to propel you into the next step.Lift your foot off the ground, which will cause a slight bend in your knee. Keep the other foot on the ground at all timesâthis is the primary way race walking differs from running. You must maintain contact with the ground at all times.Place your bent knee and foot back on the ground as you begin to push forward with the other foot and ankle.

, Straighten your bent knee as you place your foot on the ground. Using the momentum you have, keep the forward leg straight as you begin to push forward with the opposite foot and ankle. You should feel a slight pulling action in your front leg, especially in the hamstring, with this movement.Keep your stride length and quickness at a comfortable level for your body and level of fitness. Readjust them as you improve.
Notice if your straight leg feels as though itâs pushing and pulling the ground underneath and behind you. If you feel this, youâve got the stride down.

, Allowing your hips to roll as you progress through each stride helps increase your leg turnover. This makes you a faster race walker. This action is unique to race walking and it may take some time to become accustomed to it.Let your hips move as you walk. As you place a leg on the ground, the hip connected to it will rise slightly, driving you forward. As you raise the back leg and knee, the hip connected to it will fall slightly. The turning action comes as your exchange legs and keep moving forward.Avoid swinging your hips out to the side, which can cause injury., Hold your arms at a 90-degree angle and pump them vigorously in conjunction with your strides. This can help maintain your speed, maximize your strides and propel you forward.Hold your hands at the midpoint of your chest, but no higher than breast level.
Avoid tightening or hunching your shoulders when you swing your arms. This can waste considerable energy and may have a negative impact on your stride.

, You can race walk anywhereâindoors or outdoorsâand you donât need any special equipment or clothing.However, consider wearing gearâshoes and clothingâto get the most benefits from your race walking.Make sure you wear a pair of comfortable and flexible shoes. Most race walkers wear running shoes that combine cushioning and stability.
Put on clothing that fits where you are walking. For example, a sweat wicking tank would be great in the summer, and a long-sleeved merino t-shirt can ward off chills in the fall.

, Race walking training often looks much like that of a distance runner.In fact, you can race walk distances from 1 mile to 50 kilometers (30 miles). Figuring out a plan for yourself can build your fitness and improve your race walking performance. You should mix hard and easy days with periods of rest for maximum training benefits. An example of a race walking workout schedule, which you can modify to fit your lifestyle, is:Sunday: rest or recovery day with no activity or light activity.
Monday: economy workout, which is a fast-paced workout to build your speed. For example, you might walk at a fast pace for 20 to 30 minutes on these days.
Tuesday: easy workout to let your body recover. For example, you might walk at a moderate or slow pace for 30 minutes.
Wednesday: threshold workout that pushes your aerobic capacity and takes you to your limit. For example, you might walk for 30 to 60 minutes at a very fast pace.
Thursday: light recovery workout. Walk at a moderate or slow pace for 20 to 30 minutes
Friday: threshold workout, consider adding a few intervals. Walk for 30 to 60 minutes alternating between a moderate pace and a fast pace.
Saturday: distance workout that is slower and allows you to go for a longer distance and time. For example, you might walk for 60 to 90 minutes at a moderate pace.

, Before you start your race walking workout, itâs important to warm up your body. This can prepare your joints and muscles for the workout and minimize your risk of injury.Start with a slow five minute walk.
Follow up with warmup drills for 30 to 40 seconds each. Some drills you can do include: rotating your shoulders, doing arm circles, stepping quickly, and extending your leg long behind you. Hip circles, limited range of motion squats, and lunges are also good warmup exercises.

, If you are race walking for fitness or even competitions, follow your workout plan as much as possible. You may need to adjust it as you improve. In addition, take rest or easy days if you are sick and feeling fatigued. Sticking to your plan can help you improve your form and maximize your results.Scale back your workouts if you are sick and have symptoms above the neck such as runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat.Give yourself rest days if you have a fever, fatigue, or widespread muscle aches.
Revise your workout plan if you donât feel it is challenging you any longer or youâve made noticeable improvement.

, Cooling your body down after a workout is as important for you as warming it up. It decreases body temperature, can loosen tight muscles, and help you make process in your race walking.Walk for 5 to 10 minutes at an easy pace at the end of your workout., Stretching is an important part of any cool down. It helps loosen your tight muscles, increase range of motion, and prevents injury. Perform any of the following stretches for 20 to 30 seconds, or until you feel your muscles elongate without pain:Calf stretch.
Shin stretch.
Hamstring stretch.
Quads stretch.
Hip stretch.
Groin stretch.
Shoulder stretch.

, Just as recovery is an important component of your workout, so is rest. Give yourself at least one full day of rest each week. Youâll also need to make sure youâre getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.This helps your body recover and build endurance and muscle that you need to race walk.

Vary your route.,
Track your steps.,
Pump your arms.,
Walk around the house if it is raining.",How to Take a Walk After Meals2," If walking around the same loop is becoming boring, you might plan multiple routes to take for your walk. You can take a new route every week, or you can have a specific morning route that differs from your evening route.

, A pedometer or fitness tracker can help you measure how far you have walked. By keeping track of your progress, you may be more motivated to walk after every meal. Tracking your steps can even encourage you to beat old records or to compete with your friends.These pedometers may clip to your pants, or they might be worn around your wrist.

, Involving your whole body as you walk can burn more calories. Try pumping or swinging your arms as you walk. The more vigorously you do it, the more calories you will burn., If it is raining, you may not want to walk outside, but you can still do an activity after your meal. Walk a few circles around your house or office building. Try doing another low-intensity activity, such as stretching, instead.


Chores are a great low-intensity activity for when you cannot go on a walk. After your meal, wash the dishes and put them away. Scrub the table, and dust the shelves. As long as you are moving and standing on your feet, you can reap some of the same benefits as walking.If you own a treadmill, you can take your walk on the treadmill instead. Adjust the speed to a lower setting, and walk leisurely for fifteen minutes.

Build it into your schedule.,
Start small.,
Wake up earlier.,
Go with a buddy.,
Bring lunch to work.",How to Take a Walk After Meals3," To maintain a consistent schedule, write both your meal and your walks into your calendar. If you keep a digital schedule, block off time for both so that you do not feel rushed or too busy for your walk., Starting a heavy walking schedule might not be helpful if you did not walk at all before. You may only want to start taking a walk a few days a week, or you might start by only taking a walk after dinner., If you feel as though you donât have time in the morning to walk, you may want to set your alarm for fifteen or thirty minutes earlier. You will not lose much sleep, and this extra time will give you a little more room to squeeze in a post-breakfast walk., A walk can be a great time to chat with your friends, and it will help both of you get in your daily exercise. If you have a friend waiting for you, you're less likely to skip the walk.At work, you may ask one of your coworkers if they would like to take a walk with you during your lunch break.
At home, your partner or kids might want to join you.
Even your dog can be a great companion on walks. Walking the dog after every meal sets an important schedule for them and you.

, If you want to fit in a walk during your lunch hour, you should bring your lunch instead of ordering takeout or visiting a restaurant. This will save you time. You can use half of your lunch hour to eat and the other half to take a walk.

Try walking meditation.",How to Nature Walk," Whatever your reason, be it for a relaxing walk to recover from a hard day or for reasons of discovery of your local wildlife, the best time is when you have at least a half hour free and the weather is favorable. It is safest and easiest to go nature walking when light. However, if you wish to walk at night and spot some night nature activity, be sure to choose a place that is safe and to carry sufficient lighting to see where you're headed.;
, There are some commonsense basics to observe before taking a nature walk. Ensure that you're in good physical health before setting out on the walk. Take adequate water and maybe a snack, if needed. Wear supportive walking shoes that are suitable for the terrain and comfortable. Check the weather and take appropriate gear, such as a raincoat or layers of clothing, as required.

, If possible, go somewhere that is close to your home and is not too much of a hassle to get to. However, you might wish to catch local transportation or take the car if you would like to go to a specific natural area. However, anywhere that has sufficient greenery is ideal, and indeed, it can be an excellent opportunity to discover what nature exists in your local urban environment just by being prepared to be observant of nature around you.


If possible, it's best if you can walk in an area with less commotion and more greenery.

,, Instead, focus on things around you (not the people). Look around to see the buildings, shops, pavement stones, vehicles, plants, trees, flowers, and so forth.

, Notice small details about each one of these and admire them.

, It is important that you do not think about yourself or any other person (relationships), or any past incidents or future issues. Just focus on the present and look around you.

, Slowly take a walk and breathe in a relaxed manner.

,, You can continue to walk for an hour to get the optimum result, such as reducing your stress levels.

, This nature walk will not only de-stress you but also help you to realize that the world is a big place and your problem is not as insurmountable or as huge as you thought before. This walk will also ensure that you relax and soothe your nerves and make you feel mentally better.

, Whether it's just down your street or in a local park, there will be plenty to discover when you are focused on finding nature.

, Even in the middle of the city you will find nature. Look down to find the plants that are pushing their way up through the pavement, look at eye level for street trees and butterflies and other flying insects. Find the gardens in your area, whether private, community run or publicly owned. Walk by them, and if allowed, through them. Look up to see which birds are soaring in the sky above you.


Notice how people bring greenery to the city.
Notice how animals find niches in the city environment, including birds, insects, small and medium sized mammals and people's pets.

, Use this knowledge to reattach yourself to the natural world and to help you distance yourself from the concrete, the technical and the hermetically sealed environments we create for ourselves. Realize that you can always discover nature while walking about and pass this wonder onto your friends, your children and your loved ones. Taking time to notice the ways in which nature has a way of reestablishing itself even in the most reshaped of environments is a way of helping you to remember that you are part of a much bigger and interconnected whole.

, Seek to imagine what it would be like to be a part of the nature around you, such as being a tree or bush, a soaring bird or a furry animal. Stand in your desired location and breathe deeply and soak in the energy of the place and of the nature around you. Close your eyes and imagine you are a tree or a bush or something planted to the landscape. Or, imagine yourself as the animal you've chosen. Simply be for a time, seeking to think as that plant or animal might.

, This can be especially good if doing a nature walk with the kids. Have them check off natural features on a simple chart, such as animals, tree types, plant elements, rock formations, and so forth. Some other ideas include:


Create a nature counting chart

Help children to appreciate nature; and

Make a nature journal upon your return from a nature walk. Keep in mind what you'd like to include in that journal as you walk about.

, This can be a wonderful way to meditate, reflect, get exercise and feel at one with the world.

Remind yourself of all the benefits of taking a morning walk or run.",How to Go for a Morning Walk or Run," If you want to go for a morning walk or run, then you have to be equipped for it. Even if you're just doing some light jogging, walking, or doing a walk/jog combo, having the right shoes and clothes can go a long way in making you feel comfortable and excited about going on the morning walk or run. Here are some things you should get:


Go to a runner's store and have a staff member help you find a pair of sneakers that fits you correctly. The shoes should have enough wiggle room between your toes and the end of the shoe and a secure fit in the mid foot and heel.
Get light-weight, non-cotton clothes that can let you move around comfortably. Cotton clothes absorb sweat and will leave you feeling damp and uncomfortable. This means that you should get socks that are non-cotton, too.;
, The most important thing is that you give yourself enough time to actually go on the run or walk. Decide how long you want it to be -- 30 minutes is a good time for a nice long walk, and 20 minutes is a good time to run or do a running/walking combo if you're a new runner. Make sure you give yourself enough time to eat a bit, digest, get dressed, and shower and get ready for your day, too.


You don't want to go on a run that ends up jamming up your day, making you rush out to work or school, and actually make you more stressed out, instead of being more relaxed.

, If you're just going to run or walk around your neighborhood for a certain amount of time or until you get tired and know where you're going, then there doesn't have to be so much planning involved. But if you want to walk or run for a certain distance, such as 2 or 3 miles (3.2 or 4.8Â km), then you can go online to a site like Gmaps Pedometer to plan a route that would cover the amount of distance you want to travel., Some people like to go running or walking with music because it can keep them motivated, keep them from being bored, and just make the whole experience more enjoyable. However, other people like to run or walk without music, so they can be alone with their thoughts, and get their mind going at the beginning of their day. It's up to you. You can prepare a list of your favorite music and see if it works for you; if not, ditch it the next time you step out.


If you're running, you can prepare a list of your favorite ""pump up"" music. If you're walking, some more relaxing or inspiring music can work, too.

, If you're planning on getting up an hour early to go on your walk or run, then you should plan to go to bed earlier than you normally do. If you don't account for the extra sleep you need, then you'll be ready to hit the snooze button for an hour or just won't want to get out of bed when the time comes. No matter how busy your day is, you can always find a way to go to bed half an hour earlier if you need to.

, Pick that magical time when you want to get up and set your alarm accordingly. Now, all you have to do is get up and wait for the fun to begin!

, This is an important point. If you hit snooze, you'll just be falling back into a restless, ineffective sleep. If you want to start off on the right foot and really enjoy your walk or run, then get up as soon as you can after your alarm goes off. You can put your alarm across the room if necessary. After your alarm goes off, raise your arms up over your head, stretch your body, and take a deep breath. Then, drink a glass of water and step out to breathe some fresh air. Splash cold water on your face to wake up your senses. This will help you wake up more quickly.

, If you plan on eating a big breakfast, then you should wait 3-4 hours before stepping out for a run; absent that, you should just eat a smaller snack that will give you some energy and get your metabolism going around 30 minutes or more before you step out. Some great snacks include a banana, fruit juice, a low-fat bagel, an English muffin, or low fat yogurt.


Don't go running or walking on an empty stomach. You will feel tired very quickly, and may even have to deal with some dizziness.
If you like to drink coffee in the morning, make sure you drink it with some food. Drinking coffee on an empty stomach can cause digestive problems.

, You've put on your clothes, you've got your iPod, you've had some food, and now, all you've got to do is get out there and face the day. Start running if you wanted to run, or begin walking if that's what you were in the mood for. If you've planned your route in advance, then great, and if not, just enjoy the scenery and the sensation of your body moving. There are different schools of thought about whether you should stretch before running; some think it has no impact on whether you get injured, while others disagree. Some light stretching won't hurt, if that's what you decide to do.


You can string your house key through your shoelace so you don't lose it. You should also consider bringing a phone in case you get lost or fall and need some help.
If you're a first-time runner, just make sure to have the right form: keep your spine straight, look ahead instead of down, keep your elbows at a 90 degree angle, your shoulders low and loose, your hips pointed forward, your knees slightly lifted, and hit the ground lightly with your feet, landing between heel and mid-foot and rolling onto your toes.
You can take a bottle of water if you want, but if you're only going for 30 minutes or less, it's not really necessary if you've hydrated properly before and you don't want that water weighing you down. (If it's already hot outside, though, then you should bring it.)

, This may be the most ""me time"" you get all day, so use the time to think about whatever you want to think about. You can think of the day ahead and make a mental list of all that you want to accomplish. You can replay something that happened the day before. Or you can go the opposite route and not think about anything you have to do or anything that is troubling you, and just relax, focus on your breath and body, and enjoy your surroundings.

, If you finished running, then walk for a few minutes to cool down. If you were walking, then stay in place for a minute or two. Let your body temperature return to normal before you start getting on with eating, showering, or any of the other tasks ahead of you.

, Stretch when you're done with your morning run or walk so your body can feel limber and so that you can prevent injury. Just a few basic stretches, like bending down to touch your toes, stretching your hamstrings, or rolling your head or shoulders can go a long way in making your body feel recovered from your exercise. You can also sit down and do a straddle stretch, or put your feet together and reach for your toes to stretch your calves.

, If you're having a hard time getting yourself out of bed to go running every day, then you can find a friend to join you. It could be a friendly neighbor, a roommate, or just an early bird you know who lives nearby. Having a person to go with will make you accountable to someone else, and will make it less likely for you stay in bed instead of going for your run or walk.

, You can find a runner's club almost anywhere, and plenty of them meet in the mornings, before work. You will probably be expected to be able to run for at least a few miles, though you can find a club for beginners, too, so that you're running with people who are on your level. Joining this club is another great way to make sure that you actually do go for those morning walks or runs.

, If it's raining or really windy out, don't use that as an excuse to stay in bed for an extra hour. While you may not want to go running in freezing or rainy weather, you could join a gym so you can go running or walking in the early morning. Sure, running on a treadmill may not feel as exciting as running in the great outdoors, but it's better than nothing.

, Anytime you feel like staying in bed for an extra hour instead of walking or running, just remind yourself that taking a morning walk or run is one of the greatest things that you can do. It will help you start your day off right. It will give you some time to yourself, a precious 30 minutes before your busy day gets going. It will give your body some great exercise that will boost your energy levels throughout the day. Chant these reasons like a mantra, if you need to, and soon you will see that your day won't be the same without that morning walk or run.

Obtain a sturdy set of Nordic walking poles, sized appropriately for your height.,
Go outside before beginning your first session.

,
Hold the left-handed pole in your left hand and slip your left hand into the strap.,
Walk normally, and do not actually use the poles at first.,
Imagine a line on the ground perpendicular (at a perfect right angle) to your chest.

,
Grasp the poles and move forward with your right foot, stepping on the imaginary line you have drawn.,
Complete your stride and now step down with your left foot.

,
Place the right pole down as you step.,
Practice in this manner for about 30 strides or so and you will probably be able to pick up some good speed.

",How to Do Nordic Walking," Good quality poles will come with hand straps.;
,, Firmly affix the strap using your right hand. Now place your right hand into the strap of the right-handed pole and affix the strap firmly.

, Just let them dangle from your hands as you walk. This will help you get the feel of how this works.

,, Put the left pole down at the same time, on that same imaginary line. Your left pole will hit the ground at the same time as your right foot. Now just push down and backwards as you walk through the stride.

,, Once again, the pole and the foot will touch down at the same time, and on a new imaginary line drawn on the ground perpendicular to your chest.

, Be sure to switch it back and forth during your walk.

, It could be something like a foam pad, rubber ball, flashlight, camera, etc.

, You may be doing that unconsciously, so pay attention.

, Do this fairly often and for a few seconds at a time. Move them around like you are playing an instrument.

, Don't do it suddenly or in an extreme fashion. You can hurt your shoulders.

,, Keep your arms bent at an almost 90 degree angle. Be sure that your shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't opening and closing your arms at the elbows.

, This is bringing your hands up above your heart and you aren't bending your arms too much.

, When you walk, more than likely, you will sweat (if you are doing it right, anyway). Be careful not to drink too much, but be sure to be hydrated. If you don't want to carry water with you, (okay for a shorter walk), be sure to have at least a glass of water in the hour before you walk. Also, drink up when you come home.

Although not as 'refreshing', water that is less cold is easier for your body to absorb.

Give yourself a treat.",How to Maintain Your Walking Regimen," If you've previously lived a relatively sedentary lifestyle and didn't exercise much, you need to start at a lower level than someone who has been exercising consistently throughout their life.Be realistic about your starting goals. Just getting up and walking out the front door may be all you can do for a few days. Get used to the habit and go a little further each day.
At the same time, you'll get physically â if not mentally â bored if you stay too long at the same level. Increase your time or distance on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to keep yourself constantly challenged.
Aim to walk between 20 and 30 minutes a day, four or five days a week. You may want to start with five minutes the first week, increasing to 10 minutes the week after that, and 15 minutes a week later until you've reached your goal.;
, A pedometer or electronic step-counter can be a good way to measure your progress as well as set goals and motivate you to maintain your walking regimen. Downloading a fitness tracker on your phone also can help.Fitness trackers often add a social element to your exercise. You can team up with friends on social media, compete with each other, and keep track of each others' progress.
If you're a fairly competitive person (even against yourself), these trackers may work well for you not only to motivate you but to keep you on track every day.

, Even though walking is not as intense as many other forms of exercise, it is still exercise. Skipping warm-ups and stretches can increase your risk for injury.Walk at a slower pace for a minute or two to warm up. Then stretch out your legs for a minute or two and start your regular walk.
To cool down, slow your pace for the last minute or two of your walk.
You may find it helpful to measure your walk using location markers instead of time. For example, you might say that you're going to walk at a slow pace until you reach the corner, stretch on the corner, then walk around the block. When you make your way back, you can use the same corner as your marker to start your cool-down.

, If you're walking for 20 or 30 minutes, you won't have the same eating routine that a bodybuilder would have. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't have a snack before and after your walk, as well as drinking plenty of water.Before your walk, a snack such as a banana or other piece of fruit will give your body the carbohydrates it needs to provide energy for your walk.
Take a bottle of water along with you on your walk. Sip from the bottle rather than guzzling â too much liquid sloshing around in your stomach can make your walk uncomfortable.
After your walk, you need something with protein that will help repair your muscles. A handful of almonds or a glass of milk provides plenty of post-walk fuel.

, Walking is moderate cardio exercise. It shouldn't be so intense that you're gasping for breath. Generally, you should be able to carry on a conversation through the entirety of your walking regimen.Talking pace is ideal for general health. If you're walking for weight loss or cardiovascular fitness, you should walk at a faster pace. You should be breathing harder â maybe not able to carry on a long conversation â but still not gasping for breath.
To get more exercise, walk for a longer period of time â not at a faster pace, at least not until you have the strength to handle it.
If you get worn out or out of breath, it may be that you're going too hard. Slow down or cut a few minutes off your walk until you can handle that level of exercise.

, For general health, you want to walk at least three or four days a week. However, you may want to walk more often at first so you can get in the habit of doing it regularly.Walking every day also is helpful if you're just starting your walking regimen, and can't walk for a longer period of time. For example, if you're only able to walk for 10 minutes, you should be walking every day.
If you've tried to start a walking routine and have problems maintaining your regimen, doing it every day for at least a couple of weeks can help you develop a habit and solidify walking as a part of your daily routine.

, It will generally be easier for you to establish a habit if you're doing it consistently. This means trying to find a time in your schedule where you can fit in walking every day, which can be difficult if you have to work around many different commitments.Many people find mornings to be easier than afternoons or evenings. You want a time when there will be very few possibilities for interference, and mornings typically are clearer.
In contrast, many things can pop up in the evening, particularly if you work or go to school during the day. You may have to stay late at work, or have a community meeting or social engagement that interferes with your regularly scheduled walk.
Another reason it may be best to start your day with exercise is that you won't have the excuses a hard day can generate. In the morning when you're looking at a fresh day and your mind is clear, you'll have fewer reasons to avoid the exercise.

, One of the easiest ways to turn a new activity into a habit is to ""lock it"" to something else that you already do all the time. Over time, you'll come to associate walking with the established habit in your mind, and if you do one you'll do the other.If you've decided to walk in the morning, and you already have a morning routine, figure out where to fit your walk into that routine. For example, if you make coffee every morning, make the coffee and then go for a walk. When you come back from your walk, your coffee will be hot and ready for you.

, If your goals are too far away, or impossible for you to meet, you'll quickly lose heart and be tempted to give up on your exercise. To maintain your walking regimen, you need constant encouragement.Set your goals based on your performance, rather than attaching them to something else. For example, if you started walking to lose weight, don't attach your walking goals to your weight loss goals. It can make it seem like you're not getting anywhere if you follow your walking regimen for two weeks straight and don't lose a pound.
If you have a fitness tracker, it can help you with this. You may want to set goals in terms of steps, such as setting the goal of walking 500 steps a day for a week. When you achieve that goal, increase it to 550 or 600 the next week, and so on.
Make a walking calendar for yourself, and put it up on the fridge or in another prominent place. Mark off the days you meet your goal for the day, and give yourself a reward if you meet your goals for the entire month.

, Particularly if you walk outside, there are a number of different ways that your schedule could fall through. When this happens, having an automatic ""Plan B"" that you can fall back on ensures you're able to maintain your regimen.For example, it might be tempting to say ""Oh well, guess I can't walk today!"" when you see that it's raining outside. However, if you already have a back-up plan to use a treadmill, you've eliminated that excuse.
Having a go-to alternative also will keep you from scrapping exercise entirely for the day just because you slipped up.
For example, suppose you've scheduled your walk for every morning before work, requiring you to wake up 40 minutes earlier than you did before. If you happen to hit the snooze, it can be tempting to just skip the entire walk. However, you should still go for a walk anyway â even if you can only get in 10 or 15 minutes.

, Taking along a media player and headphones when you go on your walk gives your mind something to focus on so it doesn't wander and cause you to lose interest. It'll also make the time go by faster.Listening to an audiobook can be a good way to multitask â especially if you have trouble finding time to read your favorite novels or other pleasure reading. You also could choose a nonfiction title to learn about current events or gain some background knowledge about a new issue at work.
Music can put a rhythm in your step, especially if you're walking at a faster pace. Look for songs that are between 120 and 130 beats per minute â this is the typical speed for most pop songs, and the beat will closely match your pace.If you decide to listen to music while you walk, make sure the volume is low enough that you can still hear what's going on around you â especially if you're walking next to a busy street.

, If you're walking outside, such as around your neighborhood, it can get easy to get stuck in a rut when you're walking down the same streets every day. The fact that the terrain doesn't vary also can bore you physically.Open up a map application on your computer and map your main route. Then use the information from that route to design two or three other routes that are roughly the same distance.
Throughout the week, you can switch the routes randomly or based on your mood or personal preference.
If you're walking on a treadmill indoors, you can't exactly change your route. You might want to watch something on television (if the option's available) to give yourself some visual stimulation. If you have programs available on a portable device, you could even use your regular walk as an opportunity to catch up on your favorite show.

, Walking with a friend is a good way to keep from getting bored, as well as add a layer of accountability. Your friend can keep you honest about your exercising and help you meet your goals.Your companion doesn't need to be another person, however. If you have a dog, taking your dog for a walk can make the walk more enjoyable for you.
If you don't have a dog, ask a friend or neighbor if they'd mind if you took their dog walking with you. They probably won't, and that way both you and the dog can get a little extra exercise.

, If walking isn't doing it for you anymore, adding other activities or motions into your routine can challenge your body and help keep your walking regimen fresh.For example, you might walk a block, then do jumping jacks on the corner for a minute or two, then resume walking.
You can also add brief jogging intervals into your walk. If you're just starting to amp up your walking regimen, start slow with very short jogging intervals and long breaks of walking in between.
As you progress and feel yourself falling into a rut, add more intervals to continually challenge yourself.

, Never underestimate the power of positive reinforcement. If you attach good performance or meeting a goal to something you enjoy, you can motivate yourself to maintain your walking regimen.If you have the money in your budget, you can use material items such as a shirt you've had your eye on as a reward. However, you can reward yourself without spending a dime.
For example, you might treat yourself to a bubble bath, or time watching your favorite television show or movie, as a reward for meeting your goals with your walking regimen.

Forget isolation exercises, you're not a professional body builder, so ignore them.,
Working out a muscle once a week is a bad idea, you need to do it at least 2 times a week; but don't worry to much about this because a workout program based on compound exercises will prevent this.

,
Proper form is very important.,
Perform reps of 6-8, and about 4 sets.",How to Build a Solid Workout Routine1," All you really need is a barbell, a bench and some Olympic weights, so think about whether joining a gym is really necessary.

, Don't make it too easy or you will be wasting your time.


""I only want big arms and chest, nothing else"" This is not how you will workout. Your body will be completely out of proportion, accept this now. Your workout will cover the entire body, building solid strength.

, Concentrate on compound exercises which use several muscles at once; this will be faster, more effective, and more fun too.

,, When squatting bring your rear end to the floor, if you aren't doing this then you are wasting your time. Also don't do ultra slow reps, do it naturally and controlled.

, use the same weight for each. Hard, boring, but effective (a lot better than pyramid)

You will be more successful at maintaining your weight if you intentionally see yourself as a healthy person.
Make exercise and healthy eating a part of your daily life. Resolve that you will be an active rather than a sedentary person.;
, Some people are able to maintain a healthy weight this way though you may find you need to increase your time to 45 minutes or an hour, or even to 55 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You will soon learn which plan works best for you and allows you to maintain a healthy weight.

, Stretch before you begin your walk.

, Lifting or carrying light weights as you walk helps build muscle and burns calories.

, Increase your walking time and resolve to begin again.

, An illness or injury might put you off your walking routine for a time. The weather may be too hot, cold or rainy to allow you to walk outdoors. Plan alternative exercise such as using a treadmill or doing aerobics until conditions are right for you to return to walking outdoors.

,


Team up with a friend or walk your dog. Having someone else along on your walk will make it more interesting, as well as keeping you motivated to keep it up, even if you may not exactly feel like a walk on a particular day.
Vary your route from time to time to keep it from getting boring.

, Park some distance from the entrance of your workplace, for instance. Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator. Take a walk during your lunch break.

, Activity can actually lessen your appetite.

,


Walk briskly and purposefully. Maintain good posture. Attempt aerobic walking for a good cardio workout. Look for places to walk where there is an incline. Walk with hand weights or wear a backpack.
Consider interval walking where you increase your pace for short periods of time and revert again to your normal pace. You might even jog for short stints during your walk.

Take supplements.",How to Build a Big Chest," Studies show that lifting fast and hard causes muscles to grow more quickly than lifting slowly. ""Explosive"" weight training is the key to getting bigger chest muscles. Instead of counting your reps, you can try timing your workouts. Set a timer for a minute or two and do as many reps as fast as you can during the allotted time period.This type of training requires perfect technique. ""Fast on the concentric, slow on the eccentric"" is the most effective way to build muscle. In bench press, the push up is the concentric, and lowering the bar to your chest is the eccentric. In pec flyes, bringing the arms together is the concentric, and lowering your arms to the sides is the eccentric.;
, In addition to exercising more quickly, you should take a more intense approach to working out. Muscles need to be challenged in order to grow. That means you should be lifting as much weight as you can for ten reps or so. It doesn't matter how much weight you lift in relation to others; if you're lifting enough to challenge yourself, you'll see muscle growth.


Determine how much weight you should be lifting by experimenting with different weights until you find the one you can lift about 10 times before you have to stop. If you can only lift a weight 6 or so times, it's too heavy. If you can lift it 15 times, it's too light.
Working with a trainer is a good idea if you're a beginner. Make sure you don't push yourself too hard, or you'll risk injuring yourself.

, One method of weight training is to gradually move on to heavier weights. Every other week or so, see if you can handle a little more weight. It's not helpful to push yourself to exhaustion or to risk injury, but it's good to find that sweet spot where your workout is doable but challenging.

, You shouldn't work out your chest muscles every single day. They need time to recover and build up stronger and bigger in between workouts. On the days when you aren't exercising your pecs, work on your legs or back. Be sure to get a good night's sleep each night, too, so your muscles repair fully after workouts.

, Cardio exercises like running, biking, swimming, and team sports improve heart health and provide other benefits weight training cannot. Now's not the time to spend all your energy running marathons, but aim for cardio sessions that last at least 30 minutes, five days a week.


If cardio is getting in the way of your lifting, switch your priorities and do weight training first, then cardio second.

, The bench press is considered the single most effective exercise for those seeking to build a big chest. Lifting heavy weights with few repetitions is the best way to build muscle. You can use a bench press machine, barbell or even dumbbells to perform this exercise.


Have someone spot you. If you're lifting to failure (or the point where your muscles physically cannot support the lift), you absolutely need a spotter to catch the weight for you. Make sure that person is physically capable of catching whatever you might drop.
Select a weight that you can lift at 7 to 10 times.
Lie on a weight bench on your back. Grip the bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Lower the bar slowly until it touches your chest. Then return to the starting position.
Repeat until you have completed this movement 5 to 7 times, or reached failure.
Rest for a bit, then do 2 more sets.
If you can perform 10 repetitions easily, add more weight.

, Lighter weights are recommended for this exercise. The weight limit is determined by your shoulder, which is the pivot of a long lever formed by your extended arm.


Lie on your back and grasp a dumbbell or cable handle in each hand.
Extend your arms straight up in front of you.
Keep your arms extended and slowly lower your hands to either side of your body.
Return to the starting position.
Repeat for a total of 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions.
Increase weight after you can perform 12 repetitions easily.

, Supersets force your muscles to work harder, because you're doing one exercise right after another. They can be very effective in building up muscle.


For instance, after doing 10 reps of the flat bench press, go immediately to dumbbell flyes and perform as many reps as you can. Or, follow the bench press with as many push-ups as you can do.

, For a drop set, lessen the weight on each successive set and go to failure.


Perform at least 10 reps of the bench press or flyes. Immediately remove 10 pounds and perform the exercise to failure. Then, remove 10 pounds again and once more perform the exercise to failure.

, For maximum benefits, do a variety of push-ups. There's nothing more effective than the classic move:


Space your hands farther than shoulder-width apart, shoulder-width apart or close together.
Place your feet on a bench and do decline push-ups, or place feet on the floor and hands on a bench for incline push-ups.
Push yourself to failure for each set.

, These can be performed on a dip bar or even between two high-backed chairs.


Hold yourself upright between the bars or chairs, then bend your elbows and lower your body until you feel a stretch in your chest.
Return to the starting position and repeat.
For added benefit, tie a weight plate around your waist or grasp a dumbbell between your ankles or knees while performing this exercise.

, Pull-ups will not increase the size of your chest, but they complement your efforts by strengthening the back and stomach. Chin-ups (with arms closer together in an underhand grip) do engage your pectoralis major, but still focus primarily on other muscles., Your body will consume muscle if you do not intake enough calories to sustain your activity level. If you want to gain muscle, you need to create a calorie surplus, and most of that should be complex carbohydrates and protein. Avoid overloading on simple carbs and fats, which do not provide long-term energy and can encourage fat gain instead of muscle.


Eat a balanced diet of whole grains, protein (meat, fish, eggs, tofu, etc.), fruits and veggies and fiber.
Avoid sugary drinks and desserts, fast food, meat that is laden with nitrates and hormones, and salty snack foods.

, When you're focusing on muscle growth, your body needs a lot of fuel. Eating three regular-sized meals a day isn't going to cut it. Add two more meals, each with a protein source roughly the size of your palm. You may have to eat more than you actually feel hungry for, but you'll be happy with the results when you see your chest getting bulkier.


If you are lean and want to gain muscle weight, increase portion sizes. If you have excess fat you'd like to lose, keep portion sizes under control.
Eat a healthy meal an hour or so before working out. Go for healthy carbohydrates like quinoa, beans, or brown rice, paired with a light protein.
Eat another meal after you work out to help your muscles repair and build up stronger.

, You should be drinking 8-10 glasses a day, both to keep you hydrated and to help your muscles process the protein you're taking in. Drink water before and after each workout., Big muscle growth is often helped along with supplements. Creatine replicates a natural enzyme the body produces to promote muscle growth and strength. Taking the recommended dosage has been shown to help muscles get bigger, faster..

Beware of scams and supplements.",How to Body Build During College," Bodybuilders are built on clean quality wholesome food. This will require you to cook and pack your meals. You will need tupperware, pots, pans, cooking utensils, and bags.;
, Find out what classes you need to take and register for them as soon as the registration is open. Create the best schedule that fits your work schedule and workout regimen.Â Set up a workout plan, of what muscles to train each day of the week.


Set up reminders for all the important dates, for tests, quizzes, and assignments in your phone, or a planner book.

, College is a time where all your focus needs to be on you. You are spending tons of time and money for it. Friends and going out are not important as your school. Your college education comes first, then your body. What comes after is up to you.

, College schedules and social obligations can be unpredictable, but for best results, you need to get your rest. Go to bed as soon as you can. Wake up everyday in the early morning. Pack your gym bag and school bag so that you can get an early start on the day.

, An excellent workout partner will keep you motivated on the days you feel to tired or unmotivated to train.

, If friends or whoever asks you to hangout only agree if your schedule is free and school and training is taken care of.

, Eat a big healthy balanced breakfast in the morning, and prepare your meals for the day. As a college student you will always be on the go, but food is crucial, and you need to avoid resorting to fast food and junk food. Pack meals in tupperware, pack healthy, snacks and a one gallon water bottle, and carry everything wherever you go.


For aspiring bodybuilders, the fact is, if you don't eat enough , you will not grow any muscle. You need to get your calories in. It is a must to prepare your meals for the entire day, or the length of how long you will be away from home. Chicken, rice, fruits, vegetables, boiled eggs, potatoes are some examples of what you can cook quickly and pack easily. There are several Fitness YouTubers that broadcast what they cook, eat, and pack on a daily basis you one can learn from.
A bodybuilding meal should consist of a lean source of protein like chicken or fish, complex carbs such as rice, potatoes, or whole grain pasta, and veggies.

, Study, finish your assignment on time, prepare for exams, and make sure school is taken care of. Avoid going to public places where you will meet other friends. This will only waste more time, and cut time out of work, studying and training.

, Find a time gap or window where you have enough time to workout, shower if possible, and eat. When you are at the gym weight training, put your phone on airplane mode, blast music and zone out. Avoid getting caught in conversations at the gym; this is a waste of your precious lifting time. Train hard, with high intensity, making sure you destroy every muscle to the fullest after each set. Check out Youtube for different workout ideas, several bodybuilders make videos showing how they train.

, Always carry a gallon of water and drink it throughout the day.


The human body is made of 70% water, you must always drink and stay hydrated in order to build muscle.

, If you have a job during college, try to find some sort of a desk job, where you can do homework and study. If not, try to compress your school schedule in as few days as possible. Do not work those days; instead study and try to finish all your school work during this time and train. Then the rest of the week only worry about working and training.

,


Say you are full time, try to take all these classes in 2-3 days, and then work the rest of the week. Speak with your manager or boss to work out your new job schedule.

, It will all pay off in the long run. Bodybuilding is the only sport that requires 24 hours of non-stop dedication. It's all about how you look.

, Bodybuilding supplements are expensive and a waste of money. Real food beats supplements every time. If you want to take a supplement, take a multivitamin and fish oil. This will ensure you are getting all of your micronutrients for the day. Micronutrients are vital for all bodily functions.

Place the first set of plywood boards on a solid, flat surface.,

Materials needed for this step: Two plywood 4' x 8' boards;
, The difference in this step is that you want to lay them in the alternate direction of the first set.(see image) Goal here is to create structural integrity once the four boards are all screwed in together. Before proceeding to the next step, ensure that all edges of the now square platform are flush with each other and the platform is perfectly square

.

Materials needed for this step: Two plywood 4' x 8' boards

, Proceed by driving in screws at a distance of up to twelve inches apart from each other around the entire circumference of the platform, one inch from the edge(see image). For further structural integrity, drive some 1 1/2 inch screws in along the center seam of the platform. Take care not to over drill the screws as they may protrude out the other end.

, Flip the assembled platform base over onto the other side. The next steps involve cutting, assembling and screwing down the rubber mats to the edges of your platform to create a bumper barrier for your weights to hit after a completed set., It is of paramount importance to make these cuts as straight as possible in order for the finished product to look the best.

, Next, place the finished nice piece of wood in the middle to check for fit(see image 6b). Note that it's best to place the factory cut edges of the rubber mats up against the finished wood piece in the middle. This ensures the best looking fit between them and virtually no seam between the rubber and the wood edges.

, Once the center board and the rubber mats have been positioned it's time to attach the rubber mats. With help, ensure that the mats and center board don't slide while you are driving the screws into the mats. Also note that it's important to place the screws in positions close to the edge of the mats to ensure that the area where the weights will hit the mat is unobstructed(see image). Make sure to not screw in the center board at this point!

, Flip the platform over one more time on top of the center board and shimmy the nice top board (now underneath the platform) until it's perfectly flush with the edges of the platform which now is on top., Reason this was done was to make the center board where your feet go look really clean and not have any screw heads on the surface.

, Dedicate yourself to your goal! Set aside an hour or two on training days for workouts. Plan to train five to six days every week.To build this time into your schedule, wake up a few hours earlier than you have in the past.
You can also break up the workout into two to three sessions that you fit in over the course of your day.

, Once youâve got exercises that hit every muscle group in the body under your belt, mix them up for maximum effect. Instead of running through all the exercises you know in every workout, create plans that use exercises strategically. For example, you can:Pair two opposing muscle groups together by doing whatâs called âsupersetting.â Work out the biceps during one set, then the triceps during your ârestâ before the next set of bicep exercises.Hit muscles groups once every 2-3 days.Break up your upper-body training days with either rest days or workouts for your lower body., Start with very small weights, and go up a few pounds (or kilos) until youâve found the weight that lets you complete (but work hard for!) 8-12 repetitions, or âreps.â Donât worry about how big or small the number is when youâre starting out.These reps should be tough, especially by the end, but you shouldnât be straining or hurting yourself. Any weight that causes you to loose your form (such as slumping your shoulders) is also too heavy.

, Make sure youâre doing enough reps of each exercise to make it effective. Generally, a good workout includes 3-4 sets of at least 8-12 reps in each set for every exercise. If you just lift a weight one time, you wonât get very much out of your gym membership!If youâre working with really heavy weights, you can bring the reps down to five per set. You can also increase your set to fifteen reps per set if youâre using lower weights.
You can also increase your number of sets to four or even five.

, Build up to your target weight with a few lighter sets. This will warm up your muscles. You donât want to jump right into the thick of your workout, as this could lead to strain or injury.For example, do one set of 10-15 reps with a very low weight. Next, do a set of 8 reps thatâs about 50-60% of the weight youâre training at. Next, do 5 reps at 70-75%, then 3 reps at 80-85%. End with 1 rep at 90-95%.You may also want to do a brief cardio warm up, such as a 10-minute brisk walk or jog on the treadmill., Be sure you keep proper posture any time youâre weightlifting. Your shoulders should be back and together, and your back should be straight. Donât continue lifting if you feel your shoulders start to slump over the weight, or if your back is twisting.Itâs also important to breathe when you lift weights. Breathe out when you lift the weight, and breathe in when you put it back down."

Keep testing your weight limits to increase your lifts.,
Do low reps for heavy lifts to build strength.,
Do high reps for lighter lifts to build endurance.,
Take rest days to let your muscles recover.,
Work out with a partner to push yourself.,
Enter a competition to test your skills.,
Prepare for the competition by getting serious.",How to Be a Female Bodybuilder3," At the end of every month, test yourself to see where your new optimal weight is for training. Use the same rules as when you started out, increasing the amount youâre lifting until youâve found the weight that allows you complete (but work hard for) 8-12 reps.Some workout plans ask you to do a percentage of your â1RMâ for several reps. â1RMâ refers to âone repetition maximum,â or the maximum amount of weight you can lift for just one rep. This can be a dangerous number to test for, especially for beginners. For safety, go online to find calculators that give you your approximate 1RM based on the weight and reps youâre using in your current workout.

, Sets with lower reps and higher weights build muscle strength and bulk. Plan for sets of between 5-10 reps, depending on how heavy your weight is., Even though youâre focusing on bodybuilding, itâs important to add sets for endurance to your workout plan. Aim for sets of between 12-15 reps when youâre working on endurance., Rest days are just as important as exercise days. Your muscles need to heal in order to continue building up and getting stronger. An optimal workout plan has at least 1-2 rest days., Finding a workout buddy will help you keep track of your goals and stick to them. Itâll be much easier to keep yourself motivated if you have a friend cheering for you and struggling alongside you. You two can also spot each other and check for safety., Decide whether you want to compete in âbikini,â âfigure,â âphysique,â or âbodybuildingâ events.Go online to see if there are local competitions, or if youâll need to drive to the nearest city. Once youâve picked your spot, enter by using an online form and paying any entrance fees.Bikini competitions look for the traditional female shape.
Figure emphasizes muscle definition and symmetry, although these events still aim for a âsoftâ look.
Physique judges on muscle size and development.
Bodybuilding is all about being heavily muscled.
Research your show options to find out about their standards and requirements for posing, costumes, and judging.

, Keep track of what you eat, and make sure youâre getting enough protein. Youâll also need to keep your workouts consistent and high in their intensity. Buy a competition suit, and donât forget to practice posing.Eliminate all junk food and simple carbohydrates from your diet three months before the competition.
Make your workout more intense by keeping the weights and reps pretty consistent, but decreasing your rest periods in between sets. Be sure to superset exercises together.

Get enough protein to support muscle growth.,
Consume protein no more than 24 hours after workouts.,
Get enough calories to keep your energy high.,
Eat whole grains for carbohydrates.,
Donât skip healthy fats.,
Consider adding a powder protein supplement.",How to Be a Female Bodybuilder4," The most important element of a diet aimed at building muscle is protein. Aim for about 1.7-1.8 grams (0.06 oz.) of protein for every kilogram (pound) you weigh. Get this protein from lean meats such as chicken and fish, or vegetables like peas, hemp, or spinach., In order to make your protein consumption effective, eat it soon after you work out. This will allow the protein to target and build up the muscles youâve just worked out., Donât undereat! Youâre working out and sweating, which means you need lots of nutrition. The average woman should get about 2,000 calories per day. If you want to cut that number down, keep track of signs that youâre not eating enough, such as:Fatigue
Low motivation for workouts
Extreme soreness after workouts
Increased moodiness and/or depression

, Not all carbs are bad! Carbohydrates are actually a key source for the production of insulin and glycogen, both critical to your health. Get carbs from healthy sources such as whole-grain rice and pasta and quinoa.While thereâs no precise amount of carbs needed for bodybuilding, start with about 3 grams (0.11 oz.) per kilogram (pound) per day. Adjust this number by listening to body, checking your energy levels, and monitoring any weight gain or loss.

, Fats that come from unprocessed foods are critical to your overall nutrition. Eat eggs, nuts, and avocados to add these essential fats to your diet., Many bodybuilders take a daily powder supplement of whey protein. Taking this supplement in moderate, recommended amounts can aid weight loss while also promoting the building of lean muscle.Be sure to follow the instructions for dosage. If you take very high doses of whey protein, you could experience nausea, stomach pains or cramps, headaches, and fatigue.
Protein supplements arenât necessary for bodybuilding, and they canât replace natural sources of protein.

Select dumbbells of the appropriate weight.,
Concentrate on form not repetitions when you start.,
Observe your form.",How to Work out With Dumbbells1," If you have not previously done weight training, you will need to select a set of dumbbells that will meet your needs at the beginner level. You can buy a set that has a wide range of dumbbell weights, so you can start light and work up. Alternatively, you can buy adjustable dumbbells which you can increase the weight of as you go.If you're trying to tone your muscles and build endurance, rather than significantly increase muscle size, select weights that allow you to do about 12 to 20 repetitions of a given exercise before feeling overly tired.
If your goal is specifically strength training and building muscle mass, opt for a weight that you can only use for about 8 repetitions before being too tired to continue.
Scale to heavier weights once the repetitions lose their challenge by the end of the set.;
, Concentrate on using the best possible form and technique, rather than trying to rush through repetitions, to keep your workout safe and focus on your muscles. Because weights strain your muscles and require stabilization and muscle resistance, slow and deliberate movements can help you maintain control and focus on the muscle you are trying to work.


Slow movements also help build muscle and give your body a better workout, because it forces your muscles to stabilize and support the weight in every phase of the motion for longer.
Take particular care not to overcompensate with another part of your body. For example, if you are doing a bicep curl, make sure you keep upright and maintain good posture. Don't transfer the work to your back., When you are working out with dumbbells it's important to pay attention to your form and body position, to get the most out of each repetition, but also to avoid the chance of an injury. Holding your wrists, elbows, arms, and legs in the proper position can prevent injury and improve the workout you receive from your efforts.Performing exercises in front of a mirror may help you to ensure that your form is appropriate for dumbbell routines.
Check videos online, magazine articles, and speak to gym staff if you need some guidance on proper form. A trainer can help teach proper posture and body mechanics for dumbbell workouts.

Add squats to your workout.,
Do barbell squats.,
Do daily heel drop exercises.,
Do sets of behind-the-neck presses.,
Do sets of lying triceps extensions.,
Perform partial reps.,
Perform sets of exercises that target the same muscle groups on particular days.",How to Strengthen Tendons1," One of the best ways you can strengthen the tendons in your legs is through a workout that includes a healthy dose of squats. To perform a squat, stand up straight with your feet flat and shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed slightly out. Slowly bend your knees and lower yourself as though your were attempting to sit in a chair. You want to lower yourself until your hips are situated lower than your knees.Hold this position for ten seconds before rising. You may need to lift your arms out in front of you to act as a counterbalance.









You can vary and add complexity to squats in many ways. Try doing the squats facing down an incline such as on a ramp, or try doing one-legged squats while holding onto a bar for support.;
, If standard squats are already a large part of your routine, you can increase the weight you squat by doing barbell or dumbbell squats where the weight is held on the shoulders and a limited range of movement is used.Use a power rack to set the barbell height just below shoulder level, brace the bar across the shoulders behind your neck, lift off the rack by pushing with your heels and straightening your torso, then do a partial squat starting at only about 4 inches (10.2 cm).








Barbell and dumbbell squats are considered advanced technique exercises, so itâs a good idea to have a trainer around before attempting.
You may also want to wear knee wraps for additional support., Heel drops are easy exercises that require little time and no gym equipment at all, and theyâre great for strengthening Achilles tendons. Stand on a raised surface such as a step with the balls of your feet on and your heels off. Raise all the way up on your toes, and then slowly lower your heels as far as you can and hold this bottom position before rising again.








You can perform this exercise with your knees either straight or slightly bent. The different stance will work different muscles, but both are great for your tendons.You can add variety and complexity to this exercise by doing single-leg heel drops or even by adding weight from holding a dumbbell.Three sets of fifteen reps each is enough to see and feel results., This is a great exercise for strengthening tricep and shoulder girdle tendons.Use a power rack to bring a loaded barbell onto the shoulders as with as barbell squat. With your feet directly under your hips, bend at the knees just a few inches, and then reverse direction with power to straighten out and lift the barbell to full extension above your head.Use your legs to absorb the impact as you return to the starting position with the barbell resting on your shoulders.This exercise can lead to injury with improper form, especially in oneâs rotator cuffs, so practice form with a trainer with regard to weight and reps., This is another great exercise for tricep tendons.Lay down on your back on a workout bench. Lift the loaded barbell with an overhand grip straight up at full extensionâperpendicular to your torso and the floorâwith your elbows tucked in.Keep your upper arms stationary and bend at the elbows, so you bring the bar down until it nearly touches your forehead before returning to the starting position.Many people find an E-Z curl bar more comfortable for lying tricep presses.

, In addition to targeted exercises, you can target tendons even further with partial reps.A partial rep focuses on a limited range of motion. By limiting the range of motion to only a few inches, you will be able either to use more weight or to perform more repetitions, which helps to strengthen tendons.








For a barbell squat for instance, try only squatting only about four inches instead of bringing yourself further down.Since half or quarter reps allow for more weight, you should make use of a power rack to avoid injury., For instance, on Monday you may work out your shoulders, on Tuesday you may work out your chest, rest on Wednesday, work out your thighs and legs on Thursday and work out your arms on Friday.









Consistently working all core muscle groups also means consistently working all of your core tendons, which will not only add to strength but also tendon flexibility, which is important in avoiding injury in any fitness regimen."

Lean forward so that the arm youâre holding the dumbbell in has the elbow aligned near the same knee (not resting on it). Swing your arm downwards slowly to the floor, and then back up to shoulder in a set of 10. Repeat the exercise on both sides., Hold two dumbbells, one in each hand, while standing straight up. Keep the dumbbells in front of you, parallel to the front of your thighs. Bring the dumbbells up to your chest, bending your elbows outwards, and keeping them parallel similar to the motion of rowing a boat. Slowly drop the dumbbells back down to the front of your thighs, and repeat the exercise in a set of 10., Stand with your feet spread shoulder-width apart and a resistance band under your feet. Hold each of the ends of the resistance band in your hands at your sides, and slowly bring them to your shoulders. Drop your hands from your shoulders to release the tension, and bring them back to your sides., Stand upright holding a dumbbell in each hand. Hold the dumbbells like you would a hammer, with your arm bent to your shoulder and the two ends of the weights directed upwards/downwards. Slowly bend your arm downwards do your side (as if you were hitting a nail with a hammer in slow-motion), and then bring it back up to your shoulder. Do this exercise in a set of 10.

, This exercise places your hands on one bench and your feet on another, bridging the space between the two with your body. With the front of your body facing upward, use your arms to drop your body below the upper bench, and then push yourself back up. To increase the difficulty of the exercise, place a weight in your lap as you perform it.

, Kneel on a bench with a single leg and the arm from the same side of your body, while your opposite leg remains upright on the ground and you hold a weight in your opposite hand. Bend your elbow on the side with the weight to 90 degrees, and then extend your arm backwards. Slowly bring your arm back to the 90 degree angle starting position, and repeat the exercise 10 times., Lay on the floor in the plank position, and hold your hands together so that your thumbs and index fingers form a diamond shape. Slowly lift yourself up using your arms, and drop yourself back down to the starting position. As you perform this modified pushup, keep your elbows close to your body to ensure that you are actually working the triceps and not the pectoral muscles. To lower the resistance, place your knees on the floor or place your hands on an elevated horizontal bar., Lay on an exercise ball on your back, with your arms extended to your sides and a dumbbell in each. Slowly bring your weights up so that they are parallel with your forehead, and then drop them back down to the straightened position at your sides. Repeat this exercise 10 times.

, This exercise works your rear deltoids and will improve the appearance of both your arms and your upper back. Stand upright with two dumbbells in each hand, at your sides. Bend slightly at the hips, turn your hands slightly so that your pinkies are the closest fingers to the ceiling, and bring your arms outwards and up (like wings). Slowly bring them back to your sides, and repeat the exercise., Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and a resistance band underneath them. Hold the resistance band in front of you with both hands, and bring it to your chest by extending and bending your elbows outwards, similar to the motion of rowing a boat. Slowly drop your hands back to your sides and repeat the exercise.

, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your elbows and bring your hands to your shoulders, and then push the weights directly upwards above your head. Slowly bring the weights back down to your shoulders, and then repeat the exercise.

, Sit on a bench holding a dumbbell in each hand. Without resting your elbows on your torso or thighs, bend your arms and bring the dumbbells to your shoulders. Slowly release the tension and drop your arms back down so that they are parallel with your lap.

, This exercise requires you to use your hands to walk your body in a circle while you rest your shins on an exercise ball. In addition to challenging your upper body, this exercise will help you to build your core stability.

, Lay on your side so that your body is perpendicular to the ground. Slowly raise your body up into a sideways plank, and hold the position for as long as you can. Do this on each side of your body. In addition to building your arm and chest muscles, you will strengthen your abdominals and your back.

, Pushups are great for toning your chest, arms, and shoulders all in a single exercise. Lay on your stomach, and use your arms to push yourself up onto your toes. Slowly lower yourself back to the ground so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. Repeat the process; if you find it too difficult, bend your knees on the ground and work from there instead of your toes.

, As with all processed foods, processed sugars give you empty energy that lacks nutrients, leaving you only with calories. As a result, you gain fat, lose muscle tone, and feel lethargic. Whenever possible, avoid consuming processed sugars like those found in candy, junk food, and packaged baked goods and substitute in healthy sugars - like those found in fruit.


Donât jump into a processed sugar-free lifestyle immediately, as you will be less likely to stick to your regime. Instead, slowly drop processed sugar from your daily consumption. Start with nixing one thing a day - such as the soda you drink at lunch or the candy you have for a snack.
When you get a craving for processed sugar, try eating only a small amount in addition to some fresh fruit. Eventually, youâll be able to eat just the fruit as an alternative without feeling those pangs of desire for the bad sugars.

, Similar to processed sugars, saturated fats give you lots of calories with no nutritional benefit. Because of recent studies of saturated fats, many foods have clear labels marking whether or not they contain them. When you can, cut out saturated fats from your diet and substitute them for healthy fats like those found in coconut oil, walnuts, and avocados.


If you eat a diet high in saturated fats, donât cut them all out at once. Instead, reduce your daily intake a small amount each week until they are nearly or completely removed from your diet.
Take supplements such as fish oil to provide your body with omega-3 fatty acids - the type of fat your body needs to start building muscle.

, A diet high in salt can cause water retention and high blood pressure among other things. Help give yourself more energy by looking for low-sodium foods and avoiding salty junk foods - the primary high sodium culprit., Although it may sound like a broken record, fresh fruits and veggies are the ultimate muscle-building/fat-burning foods out there. Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and nutrients, making you feel fuller after consuming a complete serving than processed foods do. Aim to eat 1-2 servings of each as a minimum on a daily basis. Look for the most colorful fruits and veggies you can find, as these tend to have the most nutrients.


Some of the best vegetables for fat loss/muscle building include kale, spinach, broccoli, carrots, and squash.
Super fruits for toning your arms include blueberries, pomegranates, apples, bananas, and blackberries."

Perform bicep curls.,
Work your triceps.,
Strengthen your shoulders.,
Use dumbbells to strengthen your chest.,
Practice exercises that target your back.,
Build your trapezius muscles.",How to Work out With Dumbbells2," Your upper body consists of your arms, shoulders, upper back and chest. There are dozens of potential dumbbell variations that you can try which will work these muscles. For your biceps, the classic dumbbell move is the bicep curl. To do this, start with arms relaxed at your sides and pull up the dumbbells to shoulder height individually or together in two to three sets of eight to 20 repetitions.As you raise the dumbbell keep good posture and try not to jerk your body. Aim for a smooth and controlled motion.
Variations include a sitting bicep curl, and a hammer curl, where you turn your palms in towards your body.

, Tricep extensions are a good dumbbell exercise that you can do to work out your triceps. To do a tricep extension hold the dumbbells up over your head, one in each hand. Then, bending your arm at the elbow, lower one hand down and back to the rear of your shoulder. Raise your arm back up so it is above your head. Repeat this on the other side. Keep your arm still, and your posture upright.


For a variation you can do a two-handed extension. Hold a dumbbell in both hands and perform the same movement as before.
An alternative tricep exercise is a kickback. To do this, put your knee and hand on a bench, and hold a dumbbell in the opposite hand as you lean over.
Push the dumbbell back so your hand goes up towards your hip as you extend your elbow.For each of these exercises try to perform between two to three sets of eight to 20 repetitions.

, There are a large variety of dumbbell exercises you can do to work your shoulders. Many of these are variations on the shoulder press. To perform a shoulder press, begin by holding the dumbbells at shoulder level and then push your arms up, raising the weights straight above your head. Keep them elevated for a moment, before carefully lowering them down to your shoulders. This is one repetition.


Don't lock you elbows out when you have the weights at the highest point, and take care not to jerk your back as you try to lift them.Keep your back straight and engage your core to support you.
Presses can be done while standing or while seated.

, You can use dumbbells for bench presses, the most commonly used exercise for strengthening the chest. Bench presses with dumbbells, just as with barbells, are useful for working out the chest muscles and require extra stabilizing muscles to help you lift. This move can be varied by performing a bench press on an incline, decline, or with a neutral grip.


Laying down on a bench, with your hands in front of your shoulders, press both dumbbells toward the ceiling, hold for a moment, and lower again slowly.For variation try fly exercises for the chest. Seated on an incline, decline, or regular bench or chair, hold dumbbells out to the sides at shoulder height with arms slightly bowed.
Perform a hugging motion to bring the weights in front of your body and slowly return them out to the sides.

, You can use dumbbells to work out your back in a number of ways. Rows, bends, and dead lifts are useful and simple dumbbell exercises for strengthening the back, but they require extra attention to safety. If you suffer from back pain or injury, do not perform these routines except under the guidance of a trained fitness professional. Because of the danger of back injury, always use a weight you are comfortable with.


To perform a row, stand with your knees bent and lean forward, holding the dumbbells in each hand. Take care to keep your back straight.
One at a time or both together, lift you hands up towards your core.
As you lift the dumbbells breathe out. Breathe in again as you lower them back down.
You can also do this in a squat position, or with the arm and leg of one side of your body resting on a bench.Do two to three sets of eight to 20 reps.

, To target your traps, the muscle between your neck and your shoulder, you can do a very simple dumbbell exercise. The shoulder shrug simply involves holding dumbbells in each hand by your sides. Then make an exaggerated shrugging motion, lifting the shoulders, and slowly returning them back down to normal posture. You will soon begin to feel fatigue in your traps.Perform two to three sets of eight to 20 reps.

Use dumbbells for extra resistance with crunches.,
Perform weighted side bends.,
Try some woodchops.",How to Work out With Dumbbells3," Multiple moves can be performed with dumbbells to work out your entire core. One example of adding weight to a normal core exercise is weighted crunches. To do these, simply hold a dumbbell in front of your chest when you complete your crunches. The extra weight will make each repetition harder and increase the workout your abdominals get.Holding the dumbbell above your head will increase the difficulty significantly.
The more weight you add, the more your abs will have to work to complete each set.
Do two sets of twenty crunches.

, These are good exercises for working the oblique muscles that run either side your abs. Holding a dumbbell in one hand, lean to the opposite side. Focus on lifting the dumbbell slightly, without resting it entirely on your hip. Switch arms and sides after two to three sets of eight to 20 reps., Woodchops are a great exercise for working your core with a dumbbell. Start by holding the dumbbell up above your left shoulder with your arms extended. Then, with a chopping motion, pull the dumbbell down as you rotate your core and squat down. Bring the dumbbell down so it is on the outside of the shin of your right leg. Keep your core engaged as you swing the dumbbell back to the starting position above your left shoulder.Complete all your reps for that side, before switching and repeating on the other side.
Try not to allow your back to bend and concentrate on your core.
Do two to three sets of eight to 20 reps.

Perform toe raises with dumbbells.,
Practice lunge variations with dumbbells.,
Use dumbbells with leg squats.",How to Work out With Dumbbells4," Dumbbells can also be used to exercise leg muscles. This works by adding weight to resistance moves that force your muscles to work harder. To perform weighted toe raises, hold dumbbells in each hand, slowly raise yourself to tiptoe, and then lower yourself slowly to the normal standing position. This will focus in on your calf muscles.For variations, you can do this one leg at a time or both together.
You can also do this exercise while standing on a step. This modification will increase the range of motion by enabling your heel to drop below the level of the rest of your foot.
Do two to three sets of eight to 20 reps.

, Lunges can be performed by stepping a single foot forward or backward and keeping body weight evenly distributed between each foot. Add dumbbells to each hand to add resistance. As you bend your knees and drop down, you will feel the burn in your thighs.


You can perform a side lunge just by stepping out one leg to the side and lowering your backside towards the ground.
When performing lunges keep your back straight, don't let it round. Engage your core and concentrate on working your legs.Do front, back, and side lunges around two to three times for each leg.

, Adding dumbbells to regular squats can make a big difference and will really test your leg muscles. Hold dumbbells in each hand and slowly lower your body by bending the knees at a 90-degree angle into sitting position. Hold the pose for a moment before slowly standing up straight again. Keep your upper body steady on the way up and down.One-legged squats will increase the difficulty significantly.

Consult a physical therapist.,
Practice full extension exercises without weights.,
Add a light weight to the extension exercises.,
Add an elastic exercise band to the motions.,
Focus on the eccentric phase of each repetition.",How to Strengthen Tendons2," One of the most common reasons outside of committed personal training for which people seek to strengthen tendons is after a tendon injury. If you have an injury you suspect may be related to a tendon, first see your primary care physician for a diagnosis. If you are correct, your doctor will likely refer you to a physical therapist who can assign the proper exercises for rehabilitating the tendon.


Many tendon injuries can require several weeks of limited use rather than exercise to strengthen the tendon, so it is especially important that you consult with a professional.You may unwittingly exacerbate the problem by trying to strengthen a tendon that actually requires rest.

, Tendons receive the most work at the ends of their ranges of motion. For instance, you feel the most stretch in your Achilles tendon when you bend your ankle to full flex such as in a lunge exercise. To begin gently working tendons, do full extension exercises without any weight.








Vary the movements as well. If you are strengthening your wrist tendons, for example, make sure youâre not only full extending your wrist from side to side and up and down, but you should also turn your arm over and do the extensions in the reverse direction.You want to practice these exercises around the injured tendon for approximately ten minutes at a time as long as no pain is involved. If the movements begin producing pain, take a break from them for a day or two, and if the pain persists, contact your physical therapist.
Tendons receive the most work at full extension, so you can add to the exercise by pausing at the ends of your range of motion for ten seconds.

, Once youâve rehabilitated the tendon to the degree that you can complete the full extension flexing exercises without pain or difficulty, try adding a light amount of weight to the exercise. The amount will depend upon the degree of injury and the tendon you want to strengthen. For wrist extensions, you want to begin with only one- or two-pound weights. For a more substantive tendon such as a quadricep tendon, you may start with a five-pound ankle weight.Your physical therapist will have additional recommendations about how much weight depending upon the specifics of your injury.
If you find the weights too difficult, you can always use less weight, no weight, or stagger the days between using the weights and not.

, Elastic exercise bands are great for aiding in the rehabilitation of injured tendons because they allow you to control the amount of tension on the area, and they also increase tension toward the end of the range of motion, which is where tendons receive the most work. Place the band with a moderate amount of tension on it at the beginning of your range of motion so that extending through it increases the stretch on the band and the workload on the tendon.


As the tendon gains strength, you can add time holding at full flexes to this routine. As with muscles, time under tension helps strengthen tendons, so pausing with the tendon at full extensionâand therefore the band under the most tensionâat the apex of the repetition for ten seconds will give the tendon additional exercise.

, The eccentric phase of a repetition refers to the moment at which a muscle contracts while lengthening. For example, the eccentric phase of a dumbbell curl comes as you slowly lower the dumbbell, simultaneously elongating the muscle by straightening your arm while still actively contracting it by resisting gravity to lower the weight slowly rather than letting it drop. Focus on the eccentric phase of an exercise is often recommended for tendinopathy.Though more difficult to do with bands, the use of even light dumbbells with focus on eccentrics can help to strengthen tendons.

Do not start ripping phone books immediately unless you have already used your grip in training, in sports or in your occupation.,
Warm up for optimal results.,
Think of this stunt like a running event.",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half1," Football players and grapplers in sport have strong grips and in occupations - carpenters and other laborers have strong grips (and especially at the index finger). You must have knowledge on the workings and limitations of your hand and fingers. Knowledge and experience go hand in hand.;
,


Do a general warm-up. Such a general warm-up could include: brisk walking, jogging, cycling, circuit training, or any other invigorating activity such as washing a car. Keep the warm-up time between 10 - 20 minutes.
Next, do a few specific warm-up exercises. Estimate what phone book thickness you can easily rip and divide a book, at the spine, to those thicknesses and do at least two sub-maximal rips.

, But not as a quick oneââthink of it as more of a 100 meter (328.1Â ft) sprint than a 10,000 meter (32,808.4Â ft) run. The initial tearing of the book is powerful and the force needs to be sustained for several seconds.


Concentrate on your form and put out a lot of force quickly. There are two methods of applying force. The first method is to accelerate like a rocket launching. The second method is more impacting, like a karate chop breaking a brick or a short plank of wood. This article advocates using the second method and especially when ripping the thicker books. Whatever the case, even with a quick and powerful rip, if you have just moderate strength, your technique has to be perfect and with little room for error. The technique and strategy increase in complexity as the difficulty of performing the task increases; for example, compare ripping several sheets of paper versus ripping a 1,000 page phone book.
Review the many videos available online on the technique used by various people who have successfully ripped phone books.

"
"
Strengthen your chest muscles with push-ups, parallel bar dips and bench pressing.,
Do chin ups or rowing motions for your upper back muscles.,
Do pulling movements with a view to improving strength when moving the arms.,
Use the strongest parts of your chest muscles.,
Do plenty of grip work.",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half2,"


For bench pressing, keep the reps low but more than five reps. Obviously, the lower pecs come into play and the decline bench presses and parallel bar dips work the lower pecs.
For push-ups and dips increase the repetitions for added strength. Although the resistance, in a push-up, is the same (your body weight), your maximum bench press for five repetitions would be more if you could do 75 push-ups versus 25 push-ups.

, Again, keep the reps low for strength. There is a fine line between upper body exercises like dips and chins in terms of muscles used: both these exercises use the chest and upper back muscles.


Include some curling if doing rowing instead of pull-ups. Absolutely do curls if doing bent over rows, but if doing inverted rows omit curls if your biceps are getting a workout from this row variation.

,


When doing any pulling movement, stop the lift when the upper arm is in line with the body as shown in diagram A. As a cool down set, use a light weight and pull your arms to past your body line as shown in diagram B, for a full-range movement. Muscles can only pull (in this case, the prime mover is the latissimus dorsi or lats or wings) so when the upper arm passes the body line, the lats are out of play. This can be applied to pull-ups, rowing, chin-ups, pull-downs, and any pulling movement. So, if you are doing a rowing movement (or chins) like in diagram B, you are lifting too light, so add some plates (or an extra repetition or two) until the end of your lift is like that shown in diagram A.
Think about your technique for book ripping and apply your muscles in the angles that they are at their strongest. When doing the initial rip, think of this as a big lat and chest movement primarily instead of an arm movement to impart the maximum strength. Also, add exercises for small muscle groups that are not directly stimulated from doing the multi-joint exercises and which would help to make your book ripping stronger.

, In the bench press, the decline variation is stronger than the prone or incline. With the arms (triceps), the partial movement to full extension is very strong. When ripping a phone book, use your chest and arm muscles at their strongest range.


Note: although the chest muscles are strong in the decline position, the prone position (the flat bench press) has a higher weight lifted because of stability issues (sliding off the bench head first while in the decline position).

, Ripping a phone book demands a strong grip, so do two types of grip work: 1) thick bar lifting or pinch gripping and 2) lever bar lifting. To strengthen the grip in all fingers, the simplest way is to use a thick-handled dumbbell or barbell. A normal diameter bar is 1 1/16th inch, so lift with a thicker bar than this. Notice the rotation movements when doing lever bar movements. Besides the basic rotating movement with the weight on your thumb side of your fist, do a variation with the weight on the little finger side of you fist. When doing forearm rotations with the weight on the little finger side, be careful to avoid momentum movements because this variation is prone to momentum taking over the movement.

"
"
Use chalk to maximize your grip.,
Take the proper stance and have the proper ""feel"" before you start.,
Look at your hands and the phone book.,
Look at the book and check if the V shaped crease is to your satisfaction.,
Rest between your efforts.,
Have a well balanced training program.",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half3," Sporting goods and weightlifting stores have this item. Apply the chalk on your hands to keep them dry if you are dripping with perspiration or just got through washing your car.

, Stand up, bend your knees slightly and bend over at the waist a bit. Have your back comfortably straight and your lungs inflated (do not hold your breath). Use easy breathing exercises (the general warm-up inflates your ribcage which is the base for your upper body muscles). Breathing exercises correct the posture and prevent slouching.


Remember to exhale when applying force.

, Keep your fingers togetherââthere should be no space between them. Your forefingers are supported by the other three fingers on each hand.


Focus your strength on the initial break and especially with respect to your grip. Gripping the phone book for too long a time will sap your energy, so grip the book hard just prior to the explosive start.

, Tweak your technique as needed.

, In maximum poundage lifting, lifters will do as little as one repetition for a set and take a lengthy rest between sets. The nervous system has to recover before doing another intense effort. Before even attempting to do a rip, gripping the book hard for any length of time is a source of great energy leakage in itself.


For fitness and exercise - rest a minute or several minutes between efforts and with book thicknesses that are moderately difficult.
For power - rest as much as 15 - 20 minutes between efforts. Between efforts, stay warm and keep focused.

, Include phone book ripping as a grip exercise and short-term diversion. It's not something you'll be able to do long-term, especially since phone books are not always available and they should be recycled.


Train like you would train any other lift - train intensely, rest several days (or even a couple weeks), train intensely, repeat.
Have a complete program of: strength training, running, aerobics - if you have a sedentary job, flexibility exercises and some agility exercises.

Make a thick bar barbell by first deciding on its length.,
Using your new barbell, do some lifting to determine the space between the inner collars (you do not want your elbows to bump into the 25s or 50s).,
Use the thick bar for most lifts, except lifts like squats, front squats and bench pressing.,
Do pinch gripping of weight plates with timed holds as another alternative or as an auxiliary exercise to thick bar lifting.,
Use a lever bar to:



Strengthen grip: Strengthen your grip, at the index finger, and the other fingers too.,
After doing these exercises for several sessions, try ripping a phone book again.,
Move on to ripping thick phone books after you can easily make a clean rip with the thinner book.,
Finally, when building to a peak, do so gradually and with good form.",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half4," To make a thick barbell, go to a home improvement store and buy two lengths of pipes (the gripping length of pipe would be 1 3/4 inch thick and the longer pipe would be 1 1/8 inch thick).


Slide the thicker pipe over the 1Â 1â8 inch (2.9Â cm) pipe and permanently secure this with two inner, wrench fastened collars.
Outside of these inner collars are the plates; these plates are kept on by collars that are hand fastened. The hollow (1 1/8 inch) pipe by will bend at about 200# but with a sleeve over it, this device will not bend unless you are superman. If the plates are too snug on the bar, sand the holes of the plates with sandpaper rolled around a dowel. The sleeve can be a size or two (for big hands) thicker than 1 3/4"" in diameter.

,


Keep some space between the inner and outer collars (in the space you will load, on each end, your weight plates).
Have some space between the outer collars and the ends of the pipe. In calculating the amount of space to put on plates on a thick bar, decrease your poundage from a standard grip (1 1/16"") by 20%.

, Do chin ups or timed holds on a thicker bar. A number of outdoor gyms have bars thicker than 1 1/16"" because they are more durable, so you could get your upper back and grip work together. An example of a timed hold: Grasp a thick-bar barbell, stand up, and time the amount you hold it.


If you must do bench pressing with a thick bar, use a solid, seven feet bar, as the inside bar, instead of a pipe because serious bench pressing should be done with spotting devices and most spotting devices are made for seven feet bars. The grip also gets taxed in pressing movements, so you could do bench pressing with a thick bar for your grip work. Let the sleeve rotate by not making the inside collars tight against the sleeve.
When cleaning a barbell, having the sleeve rotate, even just a little, makes it easier.

, With these timed holds, gradually increase the time of the holds and the amount held. Pinch gripping works the thumb better than thick bar lifting, however, pinch gripping works mostly the grip. Thick bar lifting works the overall grip and other muscles.

, The position of a lever bar is like using a hammer. The lever bar lifts can be done with motion at the wrist (radial flexing) or static (isometric). A thick, long hollow pipe or a sledgehammer can also be used as a lever bar instead a short, plate loaded lever bar.

Strengthen forearm rotators: Strengthen your forearm rotators and especially the supinators. Forearm supination work will make the initial break in the phone book easier (making that initial break in the phone book is the difficult part).

Strengthen biceps: You could also strengthen the biceps and supinators by doing dumbbell curls with unbalanced dumbbell. At the start position have the hand in the neutral position (palms facing the body) and at the top position the palms are facing up.

, Strength gains are quite rapid, in the beginning, when doing new exercises and your phone book ripping will be easier. (This effort is suitable when you have just a small supply of phone books to rip.)

, As with the thin books, try to get a nice clean rip, when ripping the thick books. Ripping thick books is not just a decision based on your ability to do so, but whether the thick book is within the range of ability of your hand size. Grasping objects that are too big can cause acute pain at the base of the thumb, and it does not reflect a lack of strength.

, Have enough rest between sessions and record your rep, set, and poundage scheme. After you are satisfied with your progress with phone book ripping, give it up, and move on to another exercise or stunt. When doing the new stunt, start from a moderate (or moderate/easy) intensity and cycle up from there. Let your mind and body have some much needed rest, at these lower levels.

Begin with bicep curls.,
Practice inner bicep curls.,
Try hammer curls.,
Do seated isolated dumbbell curls.,
Practice Preacher bicep curls.,
Do tricep extensions.,
Try tricep dips.,
Practice tricep kick backs.,
Plan to do your workout three times a week.,
Vary your workout exercises.,
Use weights or resistance bands.,
Do full contractions for every exercises.,
Maintain a healthy diet as you work out.",How to Get Cut Arms," Your biceps are your strongest arm muscles and when they become more defined, they create a nice curve just above your elbows. Use free weights, also called dumbbells, that are comfortable for you to hold in each hand and provide just enough weight to be challenging but not impossible to lift.Bicep curls can be done in a standing position on even ground or seated on a workout bench.


Stand with your legs shoulder distance apart and a dumbbell in each hand on either side of your body, with your palms facing each other. The dumbbells should be horizontal in each hand.
Breathe out and raise the dumbbells until they reach the height of your shoulder. Pause and then breathe in as you lower them back down. Do not jerk your upper body as you lift the weights. You want smooth, fluid movements, with a full contraction as you move your arm up and a full stretch as you move your arm back down.
Repeat these movements for three to four sets of 12 reps.
You can also do alternating bicep curls as a variation on standard bicep curls, six times per arm, alternating each arm.;
, You are targeting your inner bicep muscles with this exercise. You can do these exercises standing or seated. If you do the seated version, sit on the end of a work out bench and keep your abdominal muscles tight as you raise and lower the dumbbells.


Hold one dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other.Breathe out and raise both dumbbells so they are on either side of your body at shoulder height. The dumbbells should be horizontal in your hands as you raise them.
Pause and then breathe in as you slowly lower them down.
Repeat these movements for three to four sets of 12 reps.

, These exercises are great for building your bicep muscles and can be challenging if you increase the reps over time.Start in a standing position with your legs shoulder distance apart. Hold one dumbbell in each hand along the sides of your body with your palms facing your body.
Raise both dumbbells by curling your forearms towards your body. The dumbbells should be vertical in your hands. Keep your upper arms straight and even. Pause and then lower them back down.
Repeat these movements for three to four sets of 12 reps.

, Itâs best to do these exercises in a seated position so you can focus on working your bicep muscles.Sit at one end of a work out bench with your legs shoulder width apart. Hold one dumbbell in your hand and place your elbow extended against the front area of your inner thigh. You should have enough room between your legs to raise and lower the dumbbell against your inner thigh without hitting your other leg.
Breathe out and raise the dumbbell until it reaches shoulder height. Pause and breathe in as you extend your arm back to the starting position.
Repeat this movement six times on each arm for three to four reps.

, To do these exercises you will need access to an arm pad that you can raise and lower according to your height.Start with Preacher bicep curls using a supination grip, where your palms are facing up. Place your upper arms against the arm pad so your palms are facing up, with a dumbbell in each hand.
Breathe out and raise one dumbbell until your forearm is parallel to the floor, pause, and then breathe in as you lower your arm back down. Repeat these movements with your other arm.
Alternate on each arm, six times each arm, for three to four sets.
You can also do Preacher bicep curls with a neutral grip, where your palms are facing each other. Repeat the same movements, alternating each arm, with a neutral grip for three to four reps.

, Strengthen your triceps by doing extensions with a dumbbell on your back, lying down. This will allow you to target your tricep muscles in a comfortable and stable position. You will need access to an exercise bench to do this exercise.Lie down on your back on a bench with your legs on either side of the bench. Hold one dumbbell with both hands so it is directly over your chest.
Breathe in as you bend your elbows and lower the dumbbell towards your forehead. Pause and then breathe out as you straighten your arms back into the starting position.
Repeat these movements 12 times for three to four reps.
You can also do overhead tricep extensions, which are done standing. Hold one dumbbell between both hands over your head. Breathe in as you bend your elbows and lower the dumbbell behind your head, pause, and then breathe out as you straighten your arms back to the starting position.

, You can do tricep dips on an exercise bench or sitting in a chair. This exercise is ideal if you do not have access to free weights as it requires you to use your body weight.Sit on the edge of an exercise bench or on the edge of a chair, with your legs bent or extended in front of you. Place your hands on either side of your hips behind you on the bench or chair.
Shift your hips forward so they are two to three feet from the bench and bend your elbows. Breathe in and lower your hips down towards the ground, bending at the elbows and creating a 90 degree angle with your arms. Pause and breathe out as you raise your hips back to the starting position.
Repeat these movements 12 times for three to four reps.

, This exercise will help to define your triceps, especially if you increase your reps over time. You will need an exercise bench to do this exercise.Start with your right leg bent on the exercise bench and your right arm flat on the bench. Keep your left leg straight on the side of the bench.
Hold a dumbbell in your left hand. Keep your lower back straight as you bend forward at the hips so your torso is almost parallel to the floor. Your left arm should be bent so your arm forms a 90 degree angle and the dumbbell is parallel to the floor.
Breathe out as you extend your left arm behind you, lifting the weight up and back. Pause and breathe in as you return your arm to the starting position. Be careful not to jerk your body as you lower the dumbbell back down.
Repeat these movements six times on each arm for three to four reps.

, When doing an exercise routine that involves weight lifting or resistance bands, you should allow your body 48 hours to recover. This means you should do your arm workout on alternating days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, for example) so your muscles have a sufficient amount of time to rest.Your arm muscles are a small muscle group and can be easily injured if they are overworked. Prevent injuries or pain by always giving your muscles time to recover between sets and between workouts.


Try to stick to the same three days schedule every week so you can commit to your workout routine and integrate it into your work schedule.

, Muscle development plateaus when you complete the same routine each session. Avoid this by challenging your muscles with different exercises on different days or slight variations on existing exercises.You may want to create a schedule of exercises where you do different arm exercises each week and rotate the exercises so you are always varying your exercises from day to day or week to week.
Your body adapts to workouts around four weeks. Change your routine within four to six weeks to prevent your body from plateauing.

, Before you start doing arm exercises, you should buy free weights that are comfortable and challenging enough for your level of fitness. You can also use resistance bands in lieu of free weights if you are looking for a more portable and convenient training tool.If you have never used free weights before, you may want to ask an assistant at your gym for tips on how to lift weights properly. For these arm exercises, you will be doing at least three to five sets of each exercise, 10-20 times each time. You should look for an amount of weight that you are able to lift 10-20 times without experiencing muscle failure or extreme muscle fatigue. During your workout, muscle failure should occur right after you have done your last rep.
The more you lift weights, the more familiar you will become with your muscle failure point. Depending on your current fitness level, you may begin with lighter weights, 5-10 pounds each, so you can build muscle strength over time.

, To maximize your workouts, you should try to complete a full contraction for every exercise. This means completing a full contraction at the top of the movement and a complete stretch at the bottom of the movement. You should move from the starting position of the exercise to the ending position of the exercise with full effort and a complete range of motion.It can help to begin by practicing these arm exercises in a full body mirror so you can watch your form and make sure you are always completing a full contraction for each movement. You should also try to squeeze or flex your arm muscles between sets to keep your muscles active and to always stretch between sets to maintain your range of motion and prevent your muscles from cramping up.

, A big part of building muscle effectively is maintaining a healthy diet, before, after, and between workouts. Itâs important that you eat properly after your work out to maximize your muscle definition and help your body replenish itself after a workout.


You should plan your meals around your daily calorie intake requirements and make post-workout meals that are high in protein and carbohydrates. Avoid foods high in trans fat and empty calories after a workout, as these will not help your body recover and can reduce your bodyâs ability to stay healthy, fit, and toned.
If you are trying to build muscle, you should eat a diet that will encourage your body to build muscle as you work out. Your diet should consist of 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men of protein (the amount of protein varies greatly on your weight, your goals and how active you are, most people only need to take in 0.37g per pound in bodyweight, athletes and the like would be having around 0.7g to 0.8g per pound of bodyweight), such as red meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy. Focus on eating complete proteins, instead of incomplete proteins, particularly animal products and vegetarian sources of protein like beans, soy, quinoa, and chia seeds. Your diet should also include healthy sources of carbohydrates, such as brown rice, rolled oats, sweet potatoes, and whole rye bread. You should cook your foods in healthy fats like olive oil (olive oil should not be be cooked with but rather used as a salad dressing sparingly, as exposing it to high temperatures changes it's structure and turns it into a bad type of fat) and sunflower oil, and consume plenty of fiber through vegetables and fruits.

Set clear goals for a safe program.,
Make an adjustable schedule.,
Alternate muscle groups.,
Include different types of exercises.,
Stretch.,
Include recovery days.",How to Avoid Overtraining1," By setting up an effective training schedule, you can workout responsibly and effectively. Making a schedule and sticking to it will help you to avoid over-training. Before you create a schedule, you need to clarify your fitness goals. Make sure to include ""Train safely and responsibly"" as a goal.Write down your goals. Be as specific as possible when you list what you want to achieve.
For example, you could write, ""I will run the Chicago Marathon in 2017."" Then you can make smaller, more specific goals that relate to your overall objective.
Make daily and weekly goals. For instance, one of your goals could be ""I will log 30 miles a week during my first month of training.""
You can also make general fitness goals. For example, you could write, ""I want to lose 5 lbs during my first month of training."" Just make sure to make sure that all of your goals allow flexibility, so that you avoid over-training.;
, Choose how many days a week you want to work out. If you are training for a specific event, you may want to try to workout most days of the week. If you are just beginning your fitness regimen, consider only working out 2-4 days a week. In order to avoid over-training, make sure to schedule a reasonable amount of training sessions.Make sure that your workout schedule fits your personal schedule. For example, are there days of the week that you absolutely cannot work out?
Don't set yourself up for failure. If you will have a difficult time working out 6 days a week, don't schedule yourself for 6 workouts. Set goals that you can feel good about accomplishing.
Make your training sessions a priority. Put each of your sessions on your calendar or in your planner.
Commit to your training sessions the same way that you commit to anything else. If someone asks you to go to the movies during your scheduled session, say, ""No, I'm busy at that time. Could we go later in the day?""

, One of the biggest risks when you are training is that you will over-train a specific body part or set of muscles. In order to effectively avoid over-training aim to alternate the muscle groups that you work. Make sure that you don't perform the same workout several days in a row.If you are focused on weight training, you will want to develop different workouts for different muscle groups. For example, your leg workout will be separate from your upper body workout.
Allow your muscles to recover for 48 hours between workouts. You can strength train daily, just don't do your leg workout two days in a row.
If you are training for a race, vary your runs. For example, choose a day of the week to do your long runs.
If you make Sunday your day for the longest run, make sure to follow up with some upper body strength work or yoga on Mondays.

, When you are training, it is natural to want to focus on either strength or cardio. Maybe cardio is your priority because you are training for a triathlon. Or maybe you lean towards strength training simply because you hate cardio. If you include both cardio and strength training, your training program will be more effective and will considerably help you to avoid over-training.One way to include different workouts is to simply schedule different activities for different days. For example, in your plan it can say ""Monday--40 minutes of cardio"" and ""Tuesday--upper body strength workout"".
If you prefer, you can also do elements of each in one workout. For example, you could run for 30 minutes on the elliptical and then head to the TRX bands for some upper body strength work.
Do your cardio first if you have a light strength session planned. Even if you push yourself to your aerobic limit, a hard run likely won't impact your performance on a light day of weights.
If you like to mix up your workouts, you can do 20 minutes of cardio, 20 minutes of strength, and then finish with 20 minutes of cardio.

, For many people, stretching is an afterthought. It's something to be done if there is a little extra time before or after a workout. But stretching should actually be an important component of your training plan. It helps you to maintain healthy muscles, and can allow you to improve your fitness without over-training.Stretching improves your joint range of motion. This can help prevent injuries that could otherwise occur.
Stretching can actually help improve your performance in many athletic activities. For example, if you're a swimmer, you will increase the length of your stroke as you gain flexibility.
Focus on major muscle groups, such as calves and hamstrings. Hold each stretch for 30-60 seconds.
Consider adding some yoga sessions to your training plan. This will help you remember to check in with your body and avoid over-training.

, You must rest in order to avoid over-training. Your muscles need time to recover each week. Make sure to schedule at least one recovery day per week. Add more if you need to.One rest day a week is recommended for regular exercisers. If you are new to exercise, schedule a rest day every third day.
Every eight weeks, schedule a de-training week. This means that you will lift lighter weights or log less miles. Your body needs more significant periods of rest every so often.
On your off days, do moderate activity. You can take a long walk or a restorative yoga class.
Just don't count reps or miles. Your mind needs time to rest and recover from training, too.

Divide the books.,
If you don't have a lot of books to rip, try some of the following substitutes:


Rip phone books as an occasional stunt and lead up to this by practicing on old magazines and newspapers.",How to Train for Ripping a Phone Book in Half5," Instead of ripping a few whole books in a session, divide a dozen or more books at the spine into halves, thirds or quarters. Then rip 25 to 30 times. This will prove to be more fun and extends the ripping opportunities over a longer period of time. Doing it this way allows you to build up a base of strength (and technique) and future workouts will be easier and less reliant on your nerves.


A good rule to follow is one taken direct from weight trainingââif you cannot do five repetitions of a lift, you are lifting too heavy. Applied to phone book ripping, if you cannot rip a few books in a session, you should be ripping thinner books.

,
Train your grip (very important), forearm rotators, upper back muscles and chest muscles. The arms get worked from doing the chest and upper back exercises; do not do any arm work unless you are doing a row instead of the the pull-up. Rows do not work the biceps much.
After training for at least three or four workouts, you will be rearing to go, so go tear those few phone books in half.

Meet with a trainer about a responsible program.,
Join a workout group to keep yourself accountable.,
Do your research about safe training.,
Talk to your doctor about methods to avoid over-training.",How to Avoid Overtraining2," Whether you are training for your fourth marathon or just starting out, you might benefit from working with a trainer.A trainer can help you create an effective program based on your goals and fitness level. A good trainer can also help you train safely so that you can avoid the perils of over-training.Find a reputable trainer. Ask friends or neighbors if they have anyone they can recommend.
Ask for a free consultation. You want to make sure that you and your trainer are compatible. Ask to see a sample workout before making a commitment.
A trainer can be a great way to change up your workouts. A fitness pro probably knows a lot of new exercises and routines that can change the way you train.

, Training with others provides great motivation. If you workout with a group, you will be held accountable for finishing your workouts. And your buddies will likely notice if you are working out too hard. If you have a habit of over-training, ask other members of your group to help keep you on track.Look for a local running group. There are many different kinds, from beginners to competitive distance runners.
Look for a gym that offers small group training. If you are lifting weights, doing it with others can inspire you to set a new personal record.
Take a class. Group exercise classes are a great way to add variety to your training routine. Try a boxing class or a boot camp style class.

, If you are serious about fitness, it's a good idea to learn more about the body and how to keep it healthy. You can find some great information about the right amount of training, and what constitutes too much. Start doing some research about the type of training you are interested in. For example, if you are a runner, look for a magazine to subscribe to.Running magazines will have a lot of great information about effective training plans. They will also offer tips on how to avoid over-training.Join an online group. There are many communities devoted to encouraging and supporting fitness. Consider downloading the Fitocracy app.Look into the latest scientific research. For example, new studies show that interval training is very effective, no matter your goals.

, Your doctor can be a great fitness resource for you. Whether you are designing a new training program or tweaking an existing one, your physician can offer some practical advice. He will be able to take your individual health into account when offering suggestions. If you do over-train, your doctor can also help you deal with injuries. He can help you figure out how long you need to rest and whether you need treatment.
Ask your doctor to help you figure out your physical limits. For example, maybe you enjoy running several miles a day, but your knees are acting up.
Your doctor can help you figure out when you are just sore from a workout or when you have an injury that needs attention.

Get the right fuel.,
Deal with injury.,
Rest up.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Avoid Overtraining3," Eating right is always important, but it is especially critical when you are training. Make sure that you are giving your body enough fuel. Plan healthy meals to help you keep your body healthy and reduce injury and illness. A good diet can help you meet your fitness goals more effectively and lessen the risk of feeling the need to over-train.Eat breakfast. If you workout in the morning, get up early enough to eat at least one hour before your training session.
Make sure to include healthy carbohydrates in your breakfast. Good foods to eat are whole grain breads and cereals, bananas, or a waffle.
Eat a healthy snack if your workout is several hours after a meal. Reach for an energy bar or a peanut butter sandwich.
Your muscles need food after a workout so that they can repair themselves. Good post-workout meals are pasta with turkey meatballs or chicken with brown rice.

, If you do hurt yourself, make sure to treat your injury. It can be frustrating to have to modify your training schedule, but it is important that you give yourself time to heal. You can still stay in shape while dealing with an injury.If you are a runner, you might occasional tweak an ankle. Take some time off from running and focus on upper-body and core exercises instead.
If your injury is chronic, consult a physical therapist. A PT can help you learn rehabilitation exercises.
When you are working out, stop immediately if you feel a sharp and sudden pain. Give it a few minutes, then try stretching the area.
If the pain persists with gentle stretching, you likely have a strain. This is a sign that you need to adjust your training schedule for at least a few days.

, When you are training, getting enough sleep is imperative. If you are tired, your body will not be able to perform at its highest level. This can decrease the effectiveness of your workouts.The average adult needs between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. If you are an athlete in training, you may need an hour or two more.
Your body repairs itself when resting. If you're not sleeping enough, you will not be able to train as hard and you risk injuring yourself.
Make sleep a priority. No matter how busy you are, try to get to bed at a reasonable hour. It's best if you go to bed at the same time each night.

, Your muscles are more prone to injury if you are dehydrated. To train safely and effectively, you must hydrate properly. Make sure to drink water before, during, and after your workout.Water is important because it regulates your body temperature, lubricates joints, and transports nutrients throughout your body.
Drink 7-10 ounces of water during every 10-20 minutes of exercise. Follow your workout with at least another 8 ounces.
You should drink about 20 ounces of water in the 2-3 hours prior to your workout. You can also drink sports drinks, but make sure to still get enough plain water.

Execute jumping jacks.,
Get in a run.,
Go for a waterless swim.,
Do toe taps.",How to Exercise While Sitting at Your Computer1," Sit up with a straight back. Bend your knees and keep them together. Your toes should just touch the floor. Open your legs and extend your arms overhead simultaneously. Keep doing this movement quickly for 30 reps. This exercise can build your endurance and get your blood flowing, which may help you think better.Do these exercises with just your legs if you need to type.;
, Extend your legs and point your toes. Bend your arms at your sides or keep them on the keyboard.

Define a purpose.,
Get a clear picture of your goal.,
Find a quality workout plan.,
Dedicate some time to warming up.,
Avoid distraction.,
Take some time off between sessions.,
Avoid becoming obsessed and spending too much time at the gym.",How to Improve Your Workout (for Men)," If you've been working out for some time, you'll already have some experience, and that's good. But what is the purpose of your time spent at the gym? If you come up with specific goals, you'll get better results and maintain your motivation.


An example might be that you want to achieve a physical form that women find irresistible and men will be jealous of.;
, Simply bulking up is not a specific enough goal. What measurements do you want to achieve? What body shape do you want to have?


The more detailed your goal is, the higher the chances of achieving it. Think about what your ideal body would look like and use this as your focal point.
Write down the measurements of your shoulders, chest etc. that you'd like to have in three months, a year from now, or five years into the future. Ask yourself this question: ""What muscles do I need to focus on in order to reach my goal?""

, You cannot build an irresistible body without knowledge of different kinds of exercises and what you can achieve with them. You'll also need to inform yourself about the proper workout structure and the particular muscles you'll need to develop. Take advantage of the vast amount of already researched knowledge available in this field. Derive a workout plan not all by yourself, but by consulting fitness experts. See ""Tips"" for some examples.


Read books by fitness specialists, as well as looking for their videos online. You can learn a great deal watching the many uploaded videos from fitness experts, and all for free!

, Don't underestimate this important first step of your workout. Many people designate a mere two minutes or less to stretching. Wrong! Optimal would be to dedicate 10-15 minutes to warming up your body. Start with 8 minutes on the stationary bicycle and concentrate on the muscles you will be working on that day.


For example, if you are going to train your chest, back and arms, do 1-2 exercises for each of these muscle groups, three sets each, using weights that make it challenging on the last few repetitions. To build strength, do 4-6 repetitions per set. For hypertrophy (larger muscle size), do 8-10 reps. For muscular endurance, 12-15.

, This includes chatting with staff or friends and listening to the radio between sets. If you want to talk to your friends, you can do so after your workout. To create your own personal workout space, take an mp3 player with a playlist of tunes that motivate you to push yourself harder.

, Train 4 to 5 times per week at maximum, which will leave you with 2 to 3 days off. It would be best not to train on weekends. If you'd like to go to the gym 4 times per week, you can do so on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. If you choose to train five times a week, it is best to take off one day in the middle of the week plus one day on the weekend.

, This will make you turn into a ""gym rat."" If your goal is to build a better looking body to improve your social life, how will this happen if you spend your life at the gym? If your training has become an addiction, limit your workout session to 80 minutes. This way you can spend enough time working on your body effectively while also maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

Do a double-leg squat.The double-leg squat is the basic squat form.,
Squat on unstable surfaces.,
Squat on a wedge.,
Squat slowly.,
Squat lower than you normally do.,
Do knee bends.",How to Exercise the Teardrop Thigh Muscle1," To get started, stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Cross your arms over your chest. Lower yourself down slowly as if youâre sitting in a chair. Keep your chest and head up and your eyes forward.Stop squatting when you feel as though you cannot lower yourself any further, and slowly stand back up.
Your knees should not extend past the end of your toes.
At the bottom of your squat, hold the position for about five seconds. Repeat 12-15 times.
If you wish to engage your lateral hip stabilizers, you could step into an elastic band and pull it into position just above your knees before beginning the squat.
A simple variation â the single-leg squat â is performed in the exact same way as the standard double-leg squat, but, as its name implies, you stand on just one leg while doing it.;
, Fold your arms over your chest in an âXâ. Stand on a foam pad or rubber air disc â both of which are available at sporting goods stores â and place your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Focus your eyes on a point in front of you and bend slightly at the knees. Lower your butt as if you are about to sit while keeping your chest and head up.When you achieve a 60-degree angle at the knees, hold the position for a second or two, then slowly stand back up.
Keep your back straight throughout.
Repeat 12 to 15 times.

, Squat as you normally would in a double leg squat, but stand on an inclined plane with your toes facing downward (toward the lower edge of the wedge). A plane angled at 25 or 30 degrees should be sufficient to achieve increased VMO activation., When performing a squat â either a double leg squat, a squat on unstable surfaces, or another type â do so at about 70-50% of the speed you normally would. For instance, if you normally take two seconds to squat, try squatting over a period of three or four seconds instead.A slow squat will increase muscular strength and help you achieve constant muscular tension.
Do not reduce your squat speed by more than half.

, A good squat will achieve a 60-degree bend in your knees. But if you can get even lower â to a knee angle of 80 degrees â you will activate your VMO even more.A squat of between 50 and 80 degrees is ideal, and will help you exercise your VMO.

, Knee bends are a simple squat variant. Just stand a foot or two away from a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean against the wall and angle your toes out and slightly to the sides.Slide your back slowly down the wall, keep your knees in a straight line between your feet and hips. Do not allow your knees to bend in towards each other.
When your knees extend to a point where they are about the same distance from the wall as your mid foot, slide back up the wall, tensing your teardrop thigh muscle as you do so.
Place a Swiss ball between your back and the wall for a smoother motion.

Return to the starting point and do as many reps as you can while holding proper form., Sit up straight and engage your calf muscles so that your heels rise up and you are on your toes. Then release your heels back to the floor before repeating this exercise for 30 reps. You can also reverse the motion by lifting your toes off the floor instead of your heels for 30 reps. These exercises target and build the muscles of your lower leg and knee.Add resistance by placing a large book on your knees while raising your toes and heels.

, Sit with your glutes on the edge of your chair and your knees bent. With your knees still bent, lift up one leg. Straighten out your leg, hold it for a second or two, and return to starting position. Repeat on the same leg for 15 reps before switching to the opposite leg.Make the extensions more challenging by extending both legs simultaneously. This has the added benefit of strengthening your core, too.

, Sit up straight and clench the muscles of your lower back and bum. Keep squeezing for 30 seconds and release for 30 seconds. Do as many reps as you can or aim to do a certain number each hour. This can build and sculpt your glutes., Sit up straight, bend your knees, and keep them together. Hold your hands behind your head and engage your core muscles.

Perform a lunge.A lunge is a body resistance exercise that works the legs.,
Do a step-up exercise.,
Stretch your iliotibial band.",How to Exercise the Teardrop Thigh Muscle2," To get started, assume a standing position and set one foot in front of the other until your leg forms a 90-degree angle. Your rear leg should extend out behind you and the thigh of your front leg should be parallel to the ground.Keep your back in a neutral position throughout the lunge. Do not flatten the curve of the lower back or arch your back.
Do not let your knee go beyond your toes. In other words, when you bend the leg that youâve extended out in front of you, the knee should not bend more than 90 degrees. If you cannot achieve a 90-degree bend in the knee, bend as deep as you possibly can.
Hold the position for 10-20 seconds, then switch to your other leg.

, A step-up exercise, as its name implies, involves stepping up and onto a large crate or box. The box should be about as high as your knee. To get started, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your toes six inches from the box. Place one foot firmly on the box or crate, then drive your body weight forward and up to get on top of the box. Step down and repeat with your other leg.In a variation, you could try stepping up onto the box laterally (from the side). Keep the box or crate about six inches from the outside of the foot you wish to place on the crate first. With the box at your side, step up with the foot closest to it. Leave room to bring your other foot onto the box, too.
Another variation involves holding dumbbells or free weights while doing the step-up exercise. Hold the weights in your hands while stepping up onto the crate or box.

, To stretch your iliotibial band while standing, cross your right leg behind your left. Bend laterally at the hip toward your left side. Do not bend forward as you do so. Hold the stretch for 20 to 60 seconds and repeat on the opposite side. Holding for any longer than one minute will not increase the benefit.


Another option is to hold the pose for 15 seconds and repeat on the opposite side. Stretch your iliotibial band on each side three times to complete a set."

Lift one leg off the ground, extending your leg straight out so that your toes point directly up. Hold that pose for 15 seconds. Place the leg down again and switch legs. Repeat three times on each leg., Place a rolled-up towel or a softball-sized rubber ball beneath your knee. Slowly raise the leg supported by the object. Repeat 12-15 times, then switch to the opposite side., To perform the leg press, simply load the machine to your desired weight, then place your feet in the center of the press pad. Push off the pad by extending your legs. Hold the position for a few seconds, then bring your knees back toward you slowly.Repeat 12-15 times.
You will strengthen your VMO more if you retract your legs further.
For instance, if you retract your legs to a position where your knees touch your chest before pushing off again, you will work your VMO harder than you would by simply retracting your knees to a position where they form a 90-degree angle.
If you are unsure how much weight you can sustain in your leg press, start with a small amount like 20 pounds. Gradually add weight in five-pound increments until youâre at a weight that causes moderate strain.

, You can use a machine or resistance bands to do a thigh extension exercise and work your VMO. Be sure to maintain a soft bend in your knee when doing this exercise.


Whether you are doing a thigh extension with a machine or resistance band, start out with a light weight or light resistance band.
Sit in the seat or chair and place your legs behind the padded weight bar or loop the resistance band through the legs of the chair and around your ankles.
Then, slowly extend your legs outwards, hold for a second and then slowly lower them back down. Repeat the exercise 12 to 15 times and do three sets.

Go to bed earlier.,
Eat breakfast.,
Set clear goals.,
Track your progress.,
Reward yourself.",How to Be Active Before Work2," A great way to adjust your schedule to include early morning workouts is to start going to bed earlier. This will ensure that you are getting enough sleep to accommodate your new routine.


If you struggle to go to bed early, try going to bed 15 minutes earlier than you did the previous night until you have reached the ideal bedtime. This will ensure a slower, steadier implementation of a new schedule that will not throw off your current routine or schedule.
Wake up earlier. Just as it is important to begin going to bed earlier, it is also important to start waking up earlier in order to adjust your schedule to including morning workouts.

, Whether you cook an entire meal or simply grab a granola bar on the way out the door, eating breakfast is important. It can help individuals maintain their weight and boost metabolism early in the day.Oatmeal is a healthy option that will keep you full until lunch time. You can add honey, fruit, or brown sugar to give it some flavor.
If you have time to cook before work, you can make eggs, toast, and bacon or sausage. This is a popular breakfast that includes protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fat. Learning how to make a healthy breakfast is an important part of a morning workout routine to help your body recover.
If you do not have time to cook before work, you can purchase breakfast and granola bars to take with you on the way out the door. Protein shakes are another popular breakfast for individuals who are on the go.

, Being clear about your goals and where you would like to be in a month, three months, six months, and a year, can be very motivating. It can help you plan out exactly what you need to do to achieve those goals.


In a notebook or Microsoft Word document, write or type your goals for the next month, the next three months, the next six months, and the next year. Remember to be realistic with yourself. For example, it is not realistic to set a goal to exercise every single day of the week. It would be more reasonable to set a goal to workout at least 3 to four days every week.
Keep the notebook or the Word document in a safe place and refer to it every month to cross off any goals you have already accomplished and to make sure that you are staying on track. You can also print out your document and hang it on the wall or store it somewhere that you will see it every day, if that will help you to stay motivated.

, Tracking your progress is a great way to monitor yourself and whether or not you are staying consistent with your new lifestyle. When tracking your progress, you will most likely stay motivated and make the changes a habit that will become stronger with time.


Keep a calendar that you can use specifically to cross off or mark the days that you work out to keep track of how often you are getting up for your morning workouts. It may help you to stay motivated once you see that you have a consecutive streak of days that you have exercised before work.

, Another positive way to stay motivated and on track is to reward yourself periodically. You will be more likely to meet your goals if it means treating yourself to a relaxing massage or purchasing those shoes youâve been eyeing.


For example, if you set a goal to exercise four out of seven days a week for three weeks in a row, and you met or exceeded that goal, you can reward yourself by purchasing something youâve been wanting for a while, making time for a special hobby, or eating a special meal you donât have very often.
Make sure you donât go overboard with your reward. You donât want to turn rewarding yourself into an excuse to overindulge.

Prepare the night before.,
Set your alarm.,
Follow through with your workout.",How to Be Active Before Work3," Have all of your workout clothes and equipment ready to go the night before so that you are not struggling to find your things the next morning. This will make it easier to get out of bed and head to your workout.


Pack your gym bag. If you go to the gym, pack your bag with everything you will need for your workout. It can be helpful to create a list of everything that you typically need and save it somewhere that is easy to reference.
Set out your equipment the night before if you workout at home. If your equipment is ready to go, you will save yourself from having to search for the things you need and wasting precious morning minutes. It will also make it that much easier to start working out before you can begin making excuses as to why you shouldnât or donât have time.

, It is important to remember to set your alarm so that you do not sleep through your workout window.


Clock radios are quite popular and commonly used. Some people prefer to wake up to the sound of the radio rather than a startling alarm. There are many options to choose from either online or in stores that have many features and show information other than the time, such as the temperature outside and the weather.Exercise trackers and smart watches often have silent alarms that vibrate to wake you up. This will help you wake up in the morning and not disturb your partner., Once you are awake, even if you are still laying in bed, it is important to motivate yourself to get up and follow through with your workout. Once you have finished working out, you will feel accomplished and more focused at work or school."

Improve your grip.",How to Get Fit for Free3," You can tone up and build strength without any equipment at all - just using the weight of your body. Isometrics exercises involve contracting your muscles without actually moving. For example, you can stand right in front of a wall with your back against it and with your arms straight. Push your arms against the wall behind you. You'll feel your muscles contracting, but your arm itself won't have actually moved because the wall is in the way.

, Callanetics has been around a long time though it is not that well known. It tones up your muscles at a very deep level using tiny ultra-slow motion pulsing movements without using equipment (other than a chair or makeshift barre).Look Callanetics videos online or see if you can borrow a Callanetics book or DVD from your local library.

,, Use the equipment you already have at home as small hand-weights. You can use soup cans (still with contents intact!) or water bottles (filled with water or sand).

Block out time to transcribe.,
Listen to the recording.,
Change the speed of the audio recording if necessary.,
Format your transcript.,
Transcribe every single word.,
Identify nonverbal communication.,
Indicate pauses in the conversation.,
Proofread the transcript.,
Listen to the recording and read your transcript simultaneously.",How to Write a Transcript1," Transcribing will probably take you longer than you imagined. On average, it takes 4 to 6 hours to transcribe one hour of a recorded proceeding. The time will vary based on your typing skills as well.It may also take longer to transcribe if there are multiple voices on the recording or you are an inexperienced transcriber.


Do not wait until the last minute to transcribe something.;
, Listen to the recording once through before you begin transcribing. This can refresh your memory about the content of the recording, understand the flow of the conversation, and identify all of the voices on the recording. You can also compare the recording to the notes that you previously took.

, Audio can be slowed down, stopped, and paused so that you can better understand the recording. Consider purchasing a foot pedal which will allow you to stop and start the recording with your feet. This will free up your hands and make the transcribing process quicker., Your transcript should include page numbers, a title, and the date. It's also a good idea to include an abbreviated version of the title and date in a header or footer on the page.You also need to identify the different voices on the recording. You can use the first letter of each person's name or a nickname.A new paragraph should be started when there is a new voice, a new topic is introduced, or when someone is quoting what someone else has said.Your transcript should not be one long block of text.

, Transcriptions should be exactly the same as the recording. Do not add any words and do not omit any words with the exception of ""ums"" and ""uhs.""Do not correct grammatical errors in your transcript either."""" is used to denote a grammatical error in the transcript. If someone says, ""They is not ready."" You would type ""They is not ready."" instead of correcting the grammar in the sentence.
If a word is inaudible, type ""(inaudible)"" or use a symbol (e.g. *, ***) to denote that a word is missing. Also, add the time in the recording where the inaudible word is. This can help you when you go back to try to figure out what was said.

, Conversations are filled with more than words. People often laugh, sigh, etc. during conversations. If someone laughs after they say something, put """" after what he or she said. For example, ""My dog is so funny. "" is appropriate.Never add your interpretation to nonverbal communication. For example, """" is incorrect. Simply typing, """" is appropriate.

, Conversations have ebbs and flows. Your transcript should reflect this. If someone pauses after he or she has said something, include this in your transcript using either ellipses or the word ""pause."" For example, ""My mother has been sick...it's been so hard on me."" or ""My mother has been sick it's been so hard on me.""Whatever method you use, be consistent.

, Use a dictionary or spell check on a computer to make sure everything has been spelled correctly. However, be sure not to edit the transcript for other errors, such as improper word usage or grammar. The transcript should reflect the exact language used in the proceeding.


Re-write your transcript if necessary, to adhere to any form or format deemed necessary.
This is also a good time to check for correct punctuation as well.

, This process is done to ensure that you transcribed correctly and can help you fill in any of the inaudible words. Again, your transcript should reflect the recording verbatim."
"
Choose a recording device.,
Prepare yourself to take down notes.,
Set up a recording device.,
Take good notes during the proceeding.,
Transfer the recording to a computer.",How to Write a Transcript2," While you may be listening attentively, it is still possible for you to miss or even misunderstand words or sentences. Having an audio recording will make the transcribing process much easier. The type of device you use will depend on your budget and your recording needs.If you can afford to, it is better to buy a digital recorder instead of using a smartphone due to poorer sound quality.If you have an iPhone or an iPod touch, you can record using the Voice Memo app.
For Android users, download the Smart Voice Recorder app or the Easy Voice Recorder app. Both of these apps are free.A good quality digital recorder can be purchased for $100 or less., Make sure that you are sitting in a comfortable position and have everything you need for note taking. This may include a computer, paper, pens, and pencils.


Developing your own shorthand will allow you to shorten words or even summarize phrases without losing their exact wording or meaning.

, This is a crucial component of any transcription. The recording device should be positioned as close possible to the voices you are trying to capture. If possible, try to do a test recording in the same room. You should also have a second recording device in case something happens. Although, this is not always possible.


If your recorder is battery operated, make sure that it is fully charged and ready to go. Also, bring an extra set of batteries.
If you are using a smartphone, make sure that the phone is adequately charged and be prepared to recharge your phone if you need to.

, Although you are recording the proceeding, it is important that you remain focused an attentive. Take notes on what is being discussed, body language of the people talking, and any thoughts or reactions you have to what is being said. These notes will help provide context when you are transcribing the document.


Write down everyone who is speaking and any characteristics of these people as well.

, Digital recorders come equipped with software that will allow you to upload the recording to your computer. If you are using a smartphone, you will need a USB cable to transfer the recording to your computer.Recordings done on Apple devices can be downloaded to your computer using iTunes. When given the option to sync music, select ""Include Voice Memos.""
Apple users can also purchase DropVox for $2. This app will automatically upload your voice recordings, and you will not need a USB cable."

, If you are aware of what your boss expects of you, you can better organize your day so that your boss' main concerns are also yours. Your boss may not always be open to informing you of what is important, so understanding priorities may be a task that you have to undertake on your own by being observant to his or her daily needs.

Earn a bachelor's degree in education.,

Earn an advanced degree in school administration.,
Become licensed as a school administrator.,
Gain experience as a teacher.,
Create a portfolio of your work.,
Gain experience as an assistant principal.,
Locate open positions.,
Apply for open positions.,
Interview and land a job.",How to Become a School Administrator," Most school administrators begin their careers as teachers, and although this is not always a requirement, a degree in education nearly always is.


You can earn an associate's degree at a community college before entering a four-year school, if desired. Be sure that your degrees are from accredited institutions.
Work with a college adviser to specify a particular grade level group and/or subject matter for your degree plan. If you know what area of school administration you'd like to work in, it helps to specialize your education degree to this area (for instance, a degree in secondary education for work as a secondary school principal).;
, This process can vary depending on your geographic area.


Generally, you will need to take several required tests, then apply for your teaching license upon successful completion of the tests.
Some states have different requirements for teacher testing. You may be asked to take the PRAXIS or other standardized test.
You can apply for, and receive, your teaching license after you have passed all required tests.

, A master's in school administration will prepare you for leadership, legal issues, diversity training, and data-driven school development, all crucial aspects of successful administration.Most people spend a number of years teaching after completing their teaching certification, and then go on to earn their advanced degree. But you can also work on the degree concurrently (enrolled part time, or taking night or online classes).
You will need to get a Master's, Ed.S. or Doctorate in school administration before or after receiving a teaching job.
Consider online classes, but be sure that the school you choose is accredited and has a good reputation in your industry. For a list of top online programs in school administration, visit http://www.thebestschools.org/rankings/25-best-online-masters-educational-administration-degree-programs/


, This process, like the teacher licensing process, can vary by state and region.


Take and pass the state test that correlates with school administration. You will receive your school administrator license after you have passed the test.
In some cases, you do not need a license to be an administrator. Typically, private school and post-secondary school administrators are not required to have a license, while public, elementary, and secondary school administrators do need one. Check the guidelines in your area.

, After receiving your teacher's license, you will need to gain at least a few years of experience as a teacher before you can move into a school administration position, which are senior positions and highly competitive.


Typically, administrators are required to begin as teachers and then advance into assistant principal positions before becoming administrators. However, some people with other very relevant experience are able to find positions as administrators without ever teaching. District policies vary, but as a rule, teaching experience is helpful in the process.It is helpful to be very active in the school and district where you teach. Take on roles as team and school improvement leaders, attend school functions and take part in data evaluations. Focus your attention on initiatives that you can quantify, like bringing up scores on standardized tests or increasing PTA memberships.
Keep a careful record of the initiatives and programs that you contribute to, as these will all be a part of your portfolio when you apply for administrative positions.

, When you begin the process of applying for open administrative positions, you will need evidence that you have a vision for school leadership and development. A portfolio is a very extensive resume or curriculum vitae with details and evidence about your professional development.


A portfolio can be created on the computer as a PDF and then printed (making it easy to add additional pages), or you can use a high quality leather binder. Feel free to include things like photographs and newspaper clippings, actual newsletters you have written, etc. Think of it as a very professional and polished scrap book.
Your portfolio should contain, at the minimum, categories for Education and Qualifications, Evidence of Professional Excellence, and Service and Activities. You can also have a more personal section containing your interests and hobbies, but its not required.Education and Qualifications should include a list of degrees, certificates, and licenses (as well as high quality photocopies of each one), academic honors, and transcripts, as well as information about any workshops you have attended.Evidence of Professional Excellence should include information about initiatives you have started or participated in, teaching evaluations, conferences attended, presentations, reviews, letters of recommendation, and samples of your work as a teacher and in any other administrative jobs you have held.Service and Activities should include information about any volunteer work you have done, beginning with work related to the school, district, or education more broadly, and ending with work that is unrelated (such as community or church volunteer service). Also include information about professional affiliation and leadership roles., Many districts prefer that principals have experience as assistants before moving into the senior position. Similarly, many university administrators begin their careers as professors.


As an assistant principal, focus on gaining experience budgeting, working as a liaison between parents and teachers, and identifying the school or district's biggest areas for academic improvement.
As with your teaching experience, be sure to document the initiatives and programs that you work on for your portfolio.

, For jobs in elementary and secondary school administration, you will complete a job search as geographically broad as you like. In post-secondary administration, you will generally wait for open positions in your institution, or if you have some administrative experience or tenure as a professor, you can seek open positions at other institutions.


Try using online websites devoted to jobs in education, like www.topschooljobs.com run by Education Week.
Keep an updated profile on www.academia.edu and www.linkedin.com, and network with professionals at other institutions to locate open positions.

, While the application process can vary, there are certain things you need to have ready to simplify the process.


Most applications are done online, so you will need access to high speed internet service and the ability to upload relevant documents.
You will need a cover letter, which you should customize to each particular job.
You will need a resume.

, The process can be nerve-wracking, but you have done so much work to gain the experience and skills needed for this position; remember that you are qualified and dedicated.


Hiring boards will ask you to present a professional portfolio if you are considered for a job, which is where all the previous experience will come in handy. Bring your professional portfolio to every interview, which you have ideally already created through the years as you gained educational and teaching experience.
You will also take part in interviews. The interview will be with school directors and supervisors. For university positions, you will interview with the dean, the provost, and/or a search committee organized by the dean or provost and comprised of other faculty members from your institution.

Be a problem solver.,
Love working with people.,
Think like an entrepreneur.",How to Become a Professional Organizer1," Professional organizers are hired by clients to tackle organization problems that require an outside perspective to solve. Some projects, such as de-cluttering a home office or facilitating a family's move to a new home, have a definite end date, while others, such as working with a business to implement a new filing system, may require ongoing attention. As you prepare to become a professional organizer, think about what type of organizing you are best at, and consider the following services you might offer your clients:


Spatial organization. Some professional organizers excel at making clients' homes more livable. They are able to look at a room and intuit the best way to maximize space and increase its functionality.
Systems organization. Professional organizers often help clients see a new system to organize their finances or files. In a business setting, the organizer's goal is to help the company increase productivity and profits by becoming better organized.
Planning and goals organization. Professional organizers are adept at seeing the big picture when their clients cannot. They teach people new ways to organize their life planning and meet life goals, whatever they may be.;
, Professional organizers are exceptionally organized, yes, but just as importantly, they love working with people. Professional organizers are called upon when their clients need help. The ability to listen carefully to people's concerns and be truly invested in helping them solve problems is essential. Part of professional organizers' job satisfaction is seeing that their work has tangibly improved their clients' lives.


Teaching, or coaching, is often central to a professional organizer's work. Professional organizers may reorganize a person's home, but they are also responsible for teaching that person how to stay organized.
Treating clients with respect and helping them feel heard is one of the best ways to get new client referrals; being personable and leaving a lasting good impression is an important part of professional organizing.

, Some professional organizers work for professional organizing companies, but most work independently, building their business through networking and client referrals. They often find their niche in the field by specializing in a certain type of organization, such as working exclusively on estate organization or reorganizing office spaces for businesses. Like other small business owners, they are adept at marketing themselves and staying on the cutting edge of their field by attending conferences and trainings.

Ask a lot of questions, attend gatherings and conferences, and be as active as you can within the association. Making a name for yourself there will give you credibility as you move forward with your career.
As you get to know professional organizers, ask if you can assist with a project. This is a good way to prove yourself and learn more about professional organizing.

, Professional organizing associations offer in-person classes ranging from Intro to Professional Organizing to Transference of Organizational Skills to guide you forward in the beginning of your career.


Some associations offer teleclasses or webinars, which are conducted online. These are generally less expensive than in-person classes.
Keep in mind that the classes offered by organizing associations don't necessarily result in a degree; rather, they are designed to educate and build confidence.

, Some companies offer training programs, with classes building toward a certification issued by that company. Some specialize in business organization, and others in personal organization.


Be sure to conduct a lot of research before signing up for a training program. These programs can be expensive, and won't necessarily lead to more clients or a better career. It's important to make sure the training program you choose is recognized as a reputable program by other professional organizers.

, When you have a few successful jobs under your belt, it's time to officially spread the word about your new business.

Use social media. Create a Facebook page and a Twitter account for your business. Update with musings on professional organizing trends and pictures from conferences you attend to show that you're at the top of your field.

In some states, such as Florida and North Carolina, public adjusters must be licensed by the state Department of Financial Services. In such states, you will usually be required to complete a certain amount of work as an apprenticeship under the supervision of a licensed public adjuster. Then, you will likely take a certification or licensing exam provided by the state. You can find out information specific to your state by looking at their Department of Financial Services website. You can also ask a public adjuster in your area how he or she got licensed and certified.Most states require you to pass some kind of licensing exam, regardless of whether you're required to have apprenticeship experience. All states require a minimum of a high school education to apply to take the exam., If your state requires it, you may have to complete a certain number of work hours as an apprentice.

Prospective legal analysts, sometimes referred to as paralegals, may choose what type of degree to pursue based on their desired work setting.


Earn an associateâs degree in paralegal studies. An associateâs degree will meet the educational requirements for certain legal analyst positions. You should consider pursuing an associateâs degree if you are interested in working in a smaller city, in a small law practice or for some state governments. When evaluating a paralegal program you should check to see how long the program has been in existence, the number of students that graduated and obtained jobs, and determine what resources that the program offers.Earn a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. If you are interested in working in a large or medium-sized city or in a large law firm, you should consider pursuing a Bachelor of Arts. You do not need to pursue a B.A. in paralegal studies but rather, you can choose whatever major interests you.;
, The ABA is a highly respected voluntary legal association that lawyers look to for guidance. In order for paralegal programs to receive ABA approval, they must follow ABA paralegal education guidelines.. If you received your B.A. in an area other than paralegal studies, attending an ABA-approved program may increase your employment opportunities.

, Once you have completed your degree, consider becoming a certified paralegal. To become certified, you must pass a paralegal exam offered by a national certifying organization, such as the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA), or through state bar associations. The certification demonstrates that you are certified to provide high-level paralegal services that are sought after by law firms., An important element of any law practice is persuasive and concise writing. As a paralegal you may be asked to draft court documents or write research memos for the attorneys. It is imperative that you can communicate complicated legal analyses in plain language. Before drafting any legal documents always consider the following:


Understand your objective before you start writing. Before you start drafting a document to a client or an attorney, clearly identify the purpose of the document and strategize on how to effectively communicate that purpose.
Prepare a brief outline. Before you start writing, quickly sketch out all of the items you need to include in the document and identify the critical information that you need to convey. Creating an outline streamlines the writing process and provides you a checklist of the topics you need to cover.
Write without concern for editing. When you first begin drafting your document, do not become overly concerned that every sentence is perfect. Instead, you should focus on the writing process and creating a rough draft.
Edit closely. Once you have a draft of your document, read it closely for grammar mistakes, sentence flow and structure. You should check to make sure that you are writing in a clear and concise manner.
Finalize your introduction and conclusion. Once the body of your argument has been drafted, go back and write the introduction and conclusion. In the introduction, focus on providing a roadmap for the reader that previews all of the items covered in the body of the document. In the conclusion, be sure that you clearly state your findings and any actions that the reader must take., Legal analysts are expected to communicate with clients, attorneys, court clerks and even opposing counsel. If you are employed, ask attorneys for the opportunity to sit in on client interviews so that you can observe how they ask questions, conduct themselves during interviews, and elicit information. If you are not yet employed, ask your school if there are internships or job shadowing opportunities that would allow you to develop these skills. Your communication skills are one of the first things an employer will notice about you and a critical part of your job as a legal analyst., A large part of any legal practice is legal research. Employers expect prospective legal analysts to be able to use online legal research databases, such as Westlaw and LexisNexis, as well as case management and trial software.Ask your paralegal program director if they provide training in this software. Additionally, you can take part in free online training sessions provided by legal software companies.

, While it is not required that a paralegal specialize in a particular area of law, by choosing a specialty you could earn a higher salary and be more competitive in the market place.Some of the most common areas of specialty for legal analysts are as follows:


Become a bankruptcy law specialist. As a legal analyst specializing in bankruptcy law you will be required to assist attorneys who represent those filing for bankruptcy or banks seeking recompense from delinquent borrowers. If you are interested in bankruptcy law, have good interpersonal skills and would like to work at a private law firm, bank or mortgage company than you should consider specializing in bankruptcy law.Become a family law specialist. Family law specialists may work for government agencies or private law firms that specialize in cases of divorce, custody hearings, adoption, and other areas involving domestic relations. As a specialist in family law, you may be asked to perform client interviews, obtain legal documents, draft legal documents and provide support for your client during a difficult time.Become a litigation specialist. Litigation specialists draft legal documents, manage litigation databases, perform legal research, manage client files, and help attorneys prepare for trial. This specialization requires that you be highly organized, be able to coordinate with a team of attorneys, and be able to manage both administrative and research oriented tasks.Become a real estate law specialist. With a real estate specialty, legal analysts may prepare and review contracts, obtain and review title documents, and track a case from beginning to closing on a property. If your interested in real estate and want to work for a private law firm, mortgage company, corporation or other business that handles real estate transactions then this may be a good specialty for you., Some national paralegal associations offer online job search features that are targeted for legal analysts/paralegals. Employers pay to post job advertisements on these websites because they are targeting their job search to trained paralegals. National associations may provide job listings for positions throughout the United States.

, If you live in a major metropolitan area and are interested in working for a large law firm, you should identify firms that match your specialization. You can look for law firms through local bar association websites or by performing an internet search with âlaw firmâ your legal specialization and your desired city. Once you identify the law firm, search their websites for paralegal/legal analyst employment opportunities.

, Large online job websites also post employment opportunities for legal analysts. If you perform an internet search for âparalegal or legal analyst employment opportunitiesâ and the location where you want to work, your search should lead you to these websites.

, If you graduated from a paralegal program, these programs may also be able to direct you to employment opportunities in the area. While enrolled in the program, ask career services personnel about internship possibilities, as well as permanent employment opportunities.

, A legal analyst in the financial world usually learns about the culture of a particular financial firm while assisting colleagues with their daily tasks.After an initial training period, you will often be placed with a specific department in order to learn about different jobs within that department.In reality, this job is usually a type of internship. While you can gain valuable experience and can work towards a permanent position with a financial firm, this opportunity usually only lasts for two or three years.At the end of that period, depending on your level of success as a legal analyst, you may be offered a more full time position in an area of interest., Typically, Wall Street type financial firms look to hire Ivy League graduates with extremely strong academic credentials. These types of jobs are often given to people with connections within the financial firm they are applying to. In order to give yourself the best chance of being hired, you should have a strong academic resume and you should try and know people within the firm you are applying to.

, A lot of people use this type of job as a first step in getting hired full time with a financial firm. For example, at Goldman Sachs, at the end of your two year period as a legal analyst, you may be brought on for another year in that capacity, or you may be hired in a different department.Therefore, while this type of legal analyst position is often seen as a glorified internship, you should take it seriously as it may lead to something more in the future.

Identify opportunities throughout your day to walk.,
Take phone calls while standing at your desk.,
Set an alarm as a reminder to get up and move.,
Clean your office before you leave each day.,
Find a buddy to join you in your quest.,
Have fun moving and being active during the day.,
Keep working on standing and working more during your work day, wherever you are.",How to Walk and Stand More While Working in the Office," Even a long stroll through the office gardens will help you shed a few calories and clear your mind, as can standing when on the phone and choosing to deliberately break every hour to walk around the office and back to your desk. Pinpoint specific times throughout your workday to ensure you get some movement going:


Break time. Even if you don't have a designated break time, you know when the brain batteries start to shut down. Instead of just grabbing another cup of coffee, consider taking a five to 10 minute stroll around the office.
Lunchtime. Whether your lunch break is 30 minutes or a full hour, take advantage of this time to move and stretch. If possible, grab a friend and go for a walk instead of hitting the pizza bar.
Before or after work. You can always find a few minutes before or after work to walk or stretch, even if it's only 10 minutes. If your child plays sports that you must attend after work, bring your exercise clothes and shoes to the field and do some walking while he or she practices.;
, According to personal trainer Rich Gaspari, standing at work will ultimately help you burn more calories. âStanding obviously puts more stress on the body than sitting, thus it will burn more calories. If you stand for an entire workday, it can help increase leg strength and endurance."" Moreover, by standing when you take a call rather than constantly sitting, you can develop a routine that allows you to break your concentration from the task you're doing and give your full attention to the caller instead.


Purchase a cordless, hands-free phone so you can stand in any area of your office, especially if it's best to get away from disturbing colleagues. Donât get tangled in that land line cord and instead purchase (or ask your office to purchase) a cordless phone and/or hands free device so you can freely stand and even do a little pacing.






Sit back down if you need to take notes or write. Going from standing to sitting and then standing again will help keep you active and burn additional calories. Changes of your position from sitting all the time will also help you to concentrate more actively on the task at hand, rather than falling zombie-like into all of the tasks before you as you continue staying seated.






Pace while talking on the phone. Boost the calorie burn by not only standing while chatting, but also pacing during your conversation. If no one is looking, you could even do a few squats or lunges while returning voicemail or making calls. In some workplaces, nobody will even mind if they do see you exercise; they might even applaud you for it!







, Itâs easy to get caught up with work, so you may need to set the timer or alarm as a stand up or walk reminder. Of course if you are in a big meeting or attending to an emergency youâll have to reset your time and reschedule for a later date.


Use your watch. If you're typically in several rooms or offices throughout the day, you may want to rely on your watch to remind you to get up and move.






Set the computer alarm clock. Those who are chained to their computer will find that using the computer alarm clock is very effective. Set it to chime every few hours as a reminder to get up, stand and stretch. Some computer programs even have an office gym program installed, so you may want to use that and include some standing and walking exercises as part of your stretching routine.






Use a kitchen timer. If you donât have access to a computer timer or a watch, an old fashioned kitchen timer may do the trick. However kitchen timers are limited in the sense that after it dings youâll have to reset it again.
Use an MP3 player, portable game player, or other digital device to remind you to ""move it."" You'll move fast to turn the sound off before colleagues hear too much of it!







, A great way to enforce movement, while accomplishing a work-related task, is to straighten and organize your office before you leave every night. The IBM Corporation instituted the âclean deskâ policy for all workers before they left at night to ensure that security sensitive information didnât fall into the wrong hands. Consider your office area to be âtop secretâ and make sure all paperwork is organized and secured and all trash or other items are properly disposed.


Stand in front of your desk as you straighten the piles of paper. Sift through piles of paperwork while standing. Not only will you burn more calories, it may give you more of a wider range of sight over a messy desk.






Pick up any loose paper or debris off the floor. Keep your work area tidy by throwing away any crumpled papers, paper coffee cups or to-go boxes before you leave.






Clean the surface and your computer. Grab a bottle of cleaning fluid and give your desk and computer a quick wipe.






Donât leave the office until your office space is cleaned and everything is organized. Commit to only leaving when your area is cleared. If you continue to clean and organize your office every night the job will become easier and you will end up working more efficiently in the long run.







, Thereâs nothing like having a friend to join you in your desire to move more. Team up with a friend who will find fun in your venture and commit to support each other. This can be particularly helpful when other colleagues question your liability to stand up and walk around at any moment; with two of you doing it, it might just turn contagious.


Plan a time to walk around the office. If you can schedule lunch or break time together, use that time to walk. Not only will you burn some calories, it will give you an opportunity to bond on a personal or professional level.






Purchase pedometers and have a friendly competition to see who can walk or move more during the day. Friendly competition can always be a blast. Purchase a pedometer and set it the minute you both enter the office. At the end of the day, meet to see who walked the most throughout the day.
Eat lunch together while standing at a high top table. Although mom always said to sit down and eat your lunch, consider standing at a high top for lunch instead; you don't need to move around but at least the standing position will help your body to elongate during the lunch hour.







, Your desire to move and stand more doesnât have to be robotic. Sometimes we just find ourselves in a bad habit of sitting, sitting, sitting until there seems like there isn't any other option. But there sure is! Find some fun and make it a game.


Do a âhappy danceâ when you land a big deal, experience success or just finish a task. Imagine how many calories youâll burn doing that âhappy danceâ when you land that big deal, complete those hideous time sheets, or achieve a work goal? If your âhappy danceâ is particularly embarrassing, you may want to do this dance behind closed doors unless you work with a crew that ""gets it."" But don't let that stop you doing it!






If your boss permits it, purchase an exercise balance ball that allows you to still reach your desk and be able to work while at that the same time, engaging your core. Share it around during the day so that others get a break from the usual sitting; you get to exercise rolling it into other colleague's cubicles (and an excuse for a quick chat)!
Do five jumping jacks once or twice (when no one is looking if need be) during the day. Who says you canât jump up and do a few quick movements to burn calories? Drop and do 10 push ups or knock out a few jumping jacksââwhatever will get your blood pumping and take you out of your sedentary stance. If workplace decorum rules this out, find an empty meeting room or do it in the tearoom outside peak use.






Stretch at your desk. Even a quick stretch can help. Consider standing up and then reaching for the sky. Bend to each side and then try to touch your toes. Or even stretching while sitting will help wake up your body and brain.







, It may take a few weeks to turn this into a habit but you should notice wonderful changes, such as reduced tension in your neck and shoulders, less stressed calf muscles and perhaps a little less weight around the tummy. Over time, this extra movement all adds up to a healthier, more cognitively well-adjusted you, just in the same way as it has for humans who have experienced movement all day long throughout history.


John Medina, a molecular biologist with a particular interest in the impact of all things on our brain, has noted that movement improves cognitive ability. So much so, that he believes workplaces would be much improved if we shifted treadmills into the cubicles, or at least in the office with breaks taken each half day to use them. He practices what he preaches and uses a treadmill with a laptop; if your workplace is open to such ideas (and one such workplace is Boeing), then suggest changes that improve your well-being and work performance and increase workplace productivity too."

Follow-up with the sender.",How to Use a Fax Machine," Place the fax machine on a flat surface close to power outlets and a telephone jack. Be sure that the paper feed is facing outward. This will help prevent the incoming faxes and scanned documents from getting stuck between the wall and the machine and prevent them from getting damaged.;
, Plug the fax machine into the nearest wall outlet. Ensure that the connection is sound and the plug fits into the outlet properly. Once the fax machine is connected to the power source, be sure that it remains off for the remainder of the set-up.

, A fax machine uses a telephone line to send and receive data to create and print documents. They will not work through an internet-based phone line. Be sure to have an active phone line and a phone number for the fax machine so your machine can transmit and receive signals to create the documents.Call your cable and telephone provider to set-up a landline if needed.

, A standard phone cable should be connected into the fax machineâs phone jack, which is typically on the back of the machine. The other end of the cord should be secured directly into the nearest phone jack in the wall. Double check to see that the cord is connected to the machine and the wallâs phone jack.

, The fax will require a supply of paper and ink to create and print the incoming documents. Be sure you have these supplies on hand.


Before inserting the paper, fan or flip through the paper stack to make sure they do not stick together. This will help prevent paper jams.Each machine will house a certain type, size, and number of ink cartridges. Be sure to review the machineâs instructions to decide what ink best works with your machine.

, Once your fax machine is connected and the paper and ink have been inserted, turn the machine on and check the telephone connection. The connection must be secure in order to use the fax machine.


Check that the landline is properly connected by picking up the fax machineâs receiver if it is available on your device. The receiver should resemble a telephone. Listen for the humming noise of a dial tone, which will indicate that the connection is secure.
If the fax does not have a receiver, you can connect a phone through the external phone jack on the fax machine. You should hear the humming noise of a dial tone if the connection is sound.

, Be sure that the machine is turned on and that the telephone cord is securely in place before sending a document. You may wish to check the receiver for a dial tone to ensure that the connection is secure.

, A cover sheet is a great way to guarantee that your document gets to the correct person. This is particularly helpful when sending faxes to a business where several employees may be using the same device. A cover sheet should include the name of the recipient, their fax number and yours, your contact information, and the number of pages the recipient should expect to receive in the fax.Including the page count on the cover sheet is useful for the recipient so they will know if they received all the necessary pages.

, Be sure to add page numbers and to put the documentâs pages in the order that you wish for them to be received. You do not want the recipient to puzzle the pages together. This can cause confusion and may interfere with the intended meaning behind the document. Ordering the pages and numbering them will ensure an efficient transfer of information.

, Most fax machines will require that you place the document either face-up or face-down into the scanner portion of the fax machine. There is no standard method across all devices. Most fax machines will indicate which method to use with an easy-to-read symbol on the front of the device., Using the key pad on the front of the fax, dial the recipientâs fax number, including the area code. If you are faxing a document internationally, you must insert the country code. If there is a corporate number that is used for dialing externally (often â7â or â9â), be sure to hit that digit prior the area or country code and the fax number.

, Once you have dialed the number, most fax machines will require that you hit a âsendâ or âstartâ button to transmit the document. Watch as the document is transmitting in case there is an error or a paper jam. When the document transfer has been successful, the fax with print out a progress report or confirmation page. If you receive an error message, try sending the document again.

, Be sure the fax machine is turned on. It is also important to make sure that the fax machine is connected to a power source and the phone jack in order to receive faxes. You may wish to pick up the receiver and listen for the dial tone to ensure proper connection.

, You will want to provide enough paper and ink in the fax machine. If you receive a lot of documents via fax machine, be sure to check these supplies frequently. Otherwise, this may prevent you from receiving a document in its entirety or delay its arrival.

, The fax machine will ring or make a dial-up sound when it is receiving an incoming document. The machine is set to automatically process these documents, so you are not required to do anything at this time. Avoid pressing buttons on the machine during this time or else the connection can be disturbed or disconnected.

, Once the fax machine has successfully received the document, it will print out the pages in the order that they were placed by the sender. Review the coversheet to ensure that you are the intended recipient and that all of the pages were successfully transmitted and printed.

, If you wish to confirm that you received the fax, or if you are worried that you did not receive all the necessary information, you may wish to follow-up with the sender via phone or email. The contact information may be listed on the coversheet, so refer to this page if you donât have the senderâs information handy.

Keep the shredder's cutting cylinder well-oiled.",How to Unjam a Paper Shredder,"


As soon as you notice a jam beginning to form, stop the shredder to keep things from getting any worse. This gives you a chance to slow down, assess the situation and prepare to fix the jam.
Jamming signs to be watchful for include a slowing down of the paper moving through the shredder, an outright stop, and a whirring, ""straining"" noise that should be readily obvious.;
,


One reason that shredders sometimes jam is that there isn't anywhere for the paper to go once it is shredded because the wastebasket is full. If your wastebasket is full, try emptying it and re-trying which may be enough to resolve your jam.
If the jam still won't clear, proceed to the following steps.

,


Because jamming is a common problem, most modern shredders come with a built-in option to run in reverse. Switch the shredder to its ""reverse"" option (usually there is a well-marked button on the top of the shredder) before plugging it back in.
Ensure your fingers or any other tools are not near the shredder opening when you plug it in.

,


Reversing the shredder will usually clear a minor jam in a matter of seconds. However, in especially bad cases, the shredder may jam again when it runs in reverse. In this case, unplug the shredder again, switch it to ""auto"" or ""forward"" (the precise option may vary on your shredder) and plug it back in.
Be prepared to alternate between auto and reverse as needed. A jam that's bad enough to gum up your shredder when it runs in reverse may be bad enough to jam it yet again when it runs forward for the second time. However, by switching between forward and reverse, it's almost always possible to gradually work your paper out of a jammed shredder.,


One of the most common reasons for a shredder jam is simply that too much paper was fed into the shredder at once. Once you clear your jam, try shredding a smaller amount of paper if this was the cause for the jam, the smaller second load should pass through with less difficulty.
If you still can't seem to get your jam to clear after alternating between reverse and auto/forward, you may have an extra-severe jam that needs to be cleared manually. Never fear, consult the section below for further help.

,


In this method, you'll be trying to remove the jam in your paper with your hands and various tools, so take this quick safety precaution to protect yourself while you try to fix the jam. You do not want the shredder to accidentally switch on while you have a finger or instrument in it.

,


Most modern shredders come in two pieces: a wastebasket and a mechanical portion on top that does all the shredding. If you can remove the latter portion, you'll have an easier time accessing both sides of the paper slot to clear your jam. Usually, the top shredding portion can be simply lifted off of the wastebasket; high-quality models may have a simple locking mechanism.
If you're able to, place the top shredding portion on a big piece of newspaper (or somewhere else where mess isn't much of a concern) before you start working.

,


Tweezers can help you get a good grip on paper stuck in the thin paper insert slot. However, you can also use your hands as long as you're sure that the shredder is unplugged.
Try pulling not just from the top of the shredder, but from the bottom as well. It is difficult to tell exactly how a shredder is jammed from looking at it, you may be able to make more progress from one direction than the other.

,


In a paper jam, strips of paper can become wrapped around the cylindrical rollers inside the shredder making it difficult to unclog the jam. Try using a a sharp knife (or, in a pinch, one blade of a pair of scissors) to slice these coiled strips and make them easier for the shredder to process.

,


If you can see that thick paper or plastic particles are stuck in the blades of the shredder (this is usually clearest when looking at the bottom of the shredder), consider using these metal tools to get a little extra leverage when removing them. Pull stubborn particles out of the machine with a firm (but not violent) yanking or prying motion.
Note when using these tools that it's crucial not to damage the blades of the shredder as you work as this can lead to costly repairs in the future.
These tools can be especially useful for removing tough pieces of plastic that have jammed a shredder after inserting a CD, credit card, etc.

,


Believe it or not, sometimes adding more paper can actually help clear a jam. For this trick, you'll need a stiff, rigid piece of cardstock (like a filing folder or a sheet of cardboard from a cereal box) that you don't mind shredding.Push the cardstock directly into the center of the paper slot while you run the shredder. Apply firm pressure to help push the jammed paper through.If you're not making progress, stop and try another method to avoid worsening the jam.

,


Sometimes, nasty jams can result if the blades of the shredder aren't well-lubricated. To solve this problem, try using shredder oil, which is available at most office supply stores and online for cheap (usually about $10/bottle.)Cooking oil also works well, but you should not use aerosol lubricants (e.g., WD-40, etc.) as these can damage the inner machinery of the shredder.
To use shredder oil, apply a few generous drops in the spots where the jam seems to be worst. Let the oil soak for about half an hour, then run the shredder forward once again. The softened paper should be much easier for the well-lubricated blades to process.

,


If you've managed to make major progress on clearing a jam but some paper remains in the shredder, try running it in reverse. Usually, you should be able to get the paper to ""back out"" of the shredder so that it can be easily removed.

,


The paper should flow through the shredder without any difficulty. If the jam appears to be clear, continue shredding!

,


As mentioned above, one sure-fire way to cause a jam is to feed more paper into a shredder than it is designed to handle at once. Luckily, the solution here is simple: after a jam, make an effort to feed fewer pieces of paper into your shredder than you previously did.

,


Another way that jams are frequently caused is by feeding several loads into the shredder without giving each a chance to process completely (this is called ""fast-feeding."") Remember that just because a sheet of paper has disappeared completely into the shredder does not mean it has been completely shredded.
To avoid fast-feeding the shredder, simply wait a few seconds after each paper load before adding the next one.

,


Folds, wrinkles and creases can easily jam a shredder as each one essentially doubles the effective amount of paper has to work through at once. Smooth out any rough spots on your paper before adding it to your shredder.
It's easy to accidentally crease the edges of a piece of paper if you're storing or handling it roughly, so be careful with the papers you plan to shred to avoid unnecessary hassles.

,


Materials thicker than ordinary paper can be difficult for shredders to handle. Try shredding these tough items by themselves to prevent a jam:

Credit cards
CDs or DVDs
Laminated paper pages
Cardboard
Thick packaging materials
Material containing adhesives.



,


As noted above, a full bin under your shredder can cause jams by preventing paper from leaving the shredder as it is processed. To avoid this, just empty your bin before this becomes a problem.
If jams seem to occur for this reason frequently, try posting a schedule for emptying the bin next to the shredder (for example, ""Please empty Monday and Thursday afternoons."")

,


Shredder oil isn't just a one-time fix for clearing jams however it's also a valuable tool for keeping your shredder in tip-top shape. Try adding a few drops to your shredder's blades every time you empty the wastebasket or a few times each month to keep the blades sharp and well-lubricated.
Note that (as mentioned above), cooking oils like canola oil usually work just as well as commercial shredder oil. In fact, shredder oil is often literally re-packaged (and marked-up) canola oil.Don't use excessive oil. With the addition of paper dust, this can eventually form a thick mixture that makes it more difficult to shred paper. Canola oil can also go rancid if it's allowed to accumulate for long periods of time (at room temperature, about 1 year.)"

Some community colleges offer transcribing courses, but you should look for ADHI-approved programs. The ADHI website also provides links to online transcriptionist courses if you'd like to complete some of your coursework at home. Coursework from ADHI-approved programs will give you better credentials.;
, If you already have general transcription coursework, you might need specialty courses for medical or legal transcribing. These might include courses to prepare you for the CDHS (Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist) exam, and terminology courses, which are often offered according to the area of speciality (cardiology for medical transcribing, for example, or real estate for legal transcribing.Medical transcriptionist courses should be ADHI approved.

, Transcribing requires that you have excellent general language skills. Beyond specialty courses, you need to have excellent knowledge of grammar and punctuation, be able to touch type, and have fluency in the language youâre writing in.If youâre not up on some of these, taking entry level language courses at your local community college can help you hone them.

, Once youâve acquired the necessary skills for becoming a general transcriptionist, get your resume ready to send out. You should include any relevant work experience. Itâs also important to include information specific to transcribing work. This includes your words per minute (wpm) typing rate, which is one of the main skills employers look for in transcriptionists, the transcriptionist coursework you have completed, and any transcription certifications you've earned., There are a lot of job sites for transcriptionists. They will direct you to independent contracting and full time jobs, based on the type of transcribing youâre certified for. Quicktate and Transcription Jobs HQ are great websites for transcriptionist jobs.

, You can use social media to find transcriptionist jobs. Websites like LinkedIn have a job search option. Type âtranscriptionistâ in the search bar and see what comes up. You can also use Twitter to run a search with terms like âtranscriptionist needed.â A lot of companies are putting their job openings on social media, with a link to the application., You can also try the old fashioned way of pounding the pavement. If you live near a university, ask if you can put up posters advertising your transcriptionist service.

Ask the receptionist at a law office if you can leave your resume., If youâve already got one client, ask them to pass your contact info to others looking for transcriptionists. This is a great way to build a network of reputable employers to work for., You need to be able to work somewhere quiet, where you can hear the audio files your clients send you. You should also have a good, comfortable desk chair: transcribing one hour of audio can take up to three hours and you donât want to be sore when youâre done., Youâll need word processing for the actual transcribing. Itâs best to use a common word-processing software, because it ensures there wonât be any issues when you send transcripts back to your clients. Microsoft Word or Apple Pages are common types of word processing software.Some jobs might require you use specific software. Find out before you start the job.

, Because youâll be receiving large audio files, youâll need a way to transfer them easily. These types of files are usually too big to send as an email attachment. Signing up for something like Dropbox or Google Drive will make file transfers easier. It also helps you keep your work all in one place., Since your work will center on listening to audio files to transcribe, a good pair of headphones will help in your work. Look for noise-canceling headphones, as they can allow you to work pretty much anywhere.

Admit your mistake.,
Apologize.,
Commit to reform.,
Keep your attitude in check.",How to Repair Your Damaged Reputation at Work1," If youâve damaged your reputation â wronging a coworker, angering your boss, or just getting an overall bad name â the place to start is to own up to it. Admit the error of your ways. Take stock of your actions and accept responsibility for them, to yourself and in front of others.What happened? Where did you go wrong? Be brutally honest with yourself.
For example, do you have bad personal habits? Did you try to cut corners and dodge work? Have you been an office gossip?
Or, did you have a serious lapse of judgement? Perhaps you stole someoneâs idea and got caught or plagiarized a report. Perhaps you just stole, embezzling money.;
, Even if you donât have a future at your workplace, you should apologize to the people youâve hurt. Showing remorse is decent and will help you start to redeem yourself. You will not get very far with building bridges and repairing your reputation if you canât say sorry.Act as soon as you can. The longer you wait to apologize, the more it seems like you arenât really that sorry.Donât make excuses. The point is to show remorse and accept that you were wrong. Donât insert half-excuses or mealy-mouth language into your apology, for example âIâm sorry if you were offended that I took your idea. I only wanted to improve it.â
Be humble and own up. For instance, âIt was really wrong of me to talk behind your back. I know Iâve hurt you and want to ask for your forgiveness.â
Be sincere. You wonât get credit if you donât say specifically what you did. You also wonât credit if you donât say it apologetically and sincerely, showing that you won't repeat the behavior., Besides an apology, write out a plan for how youâll change and ensure your mistake doesnât happen again. This can be for you alone or, if youâre lucky to keep your job, to share with the powers that be in the organization.Outline what you did wrong and how you will avoid it. For example, âI made the mistake of getting too involved in workplace gossip and ended up saying harmful things about my coworkers. From now on, I plan to keep my head down, mind my own business, and avoid office politics.â
Donât forget to âwalk the walkâ and follow your plan. You might arrange regular check-ins with your boss, for instance, to discuss your behavior. This will highlight your progress as well as show that you are willing and able to reform., Repairing your reputation is going to be a humbling experience. You might feel angry or resentful. You might get annoyed, frustrated, or upset. Keep these emotions under control â youâve had a bad attitude in the past and need others to see that youâre trying to change.


Try to stay calm, collected, and positive.
Be aware of the attitudes or emotions that added to your bad behavior in the past. Try to avoid them or situations that bring them out. If your problem is gossip, avoid the office gossipers as best you can.
Stop and ask yourself throughout the day, âHowâs my attitude? Am I positive? Am I productive?â Catch any problems early and try to readjust your mindset.

Get to work early.,
Prioritize.,
Do your tasks thoroughly and on-time.,
Go above and beyond.",How to Repair Your Damaged Reputation at Work2," Apart from apologies and repairing relationships, set yourself up as a model employee to help you rebuild your work reputation. Be a go-getter. Arrive early and ready to impress. People will eventually start to notice.Getting to work early will make a good impression on your boss and perhaps your coworkers. Often, people arenât around to see who leaves the office last. But they will notice your presence in the morning.
Being early also means you donât have to rush around. Use the quiet time to your advantage and plan out your day.
It doesnât hurt to take a short walk around the office first thing in the morning. People will see you and take note.

, Some people have trouble keeping track of what they need to do during a given day or week. Take initiative and prioritize your work. Keep your nose to the grindstone to avoid returning to past mistakes and to present yourself as great employee.For instance, sit down and write out what you need to do for each day or, longer term, each week and month. If youâve been coming to work early, use that time to set out daily priorities.
Having a to-do list will help you focus your energy. You might also tailor the list to take advantage of your peak work hours. For instance, if you do your best work in the morning, save that time for your top priorities.
Try to stick to the list. That said, be flexible in case your boss gives you special instructions.

, Writing down your tasks isnât all, of course. You actually need to follow through and do them well. Good work and dependability can make a past mistake fade over time. Build up a track record for reliability and your colleagues and boss will have more trust in you in the future.


Meet your deadlines. What about that report thatâs due next week? Prioritize it in your list on Monday. If you still canât get it done during the week, consider finishing it at home or over the weekend rather than asking for more time.
Be productive, especially if you have had consistency problems before. Take a short breather to stretch or use the restroom, but donât try to skirt work.

, Handing in finished work on time is good. To be a model employee, though, you will have to aim even higher and win (or win back) your bossâ trust. Track details, anticipate tasks, and work ahead to further develop a good reputation.


If a colleague asks you to think of venues for an upcoming tradeshow, for example, donât just stop at a list. Take the next steps: call them, ask about availability, and compare prices.When you take initiative like this, youâll seem smart and like the logical go-to person for key projects.

Check your online metrics.,
Deal with Google defamation.,
Hire an online reputation manager.",How to Repair Your Damaged Reputation at Work3," If your error was very serious, or if you are well-known and hold a big position, you might want to think about your online presence when rebuilding your reputation. Donât underestimate negative online info. To start, you will need to take stock of the situation.You can get a quick sense of your online reputation by checking Googleâs autocomplete. Just go to the Google homepage. What appears when you type in your name, or your company name?
When you enter your name, for example, do you get something positive or neutral like âHarold Bing Brew Co. CEOâ and âHarold Bing business awardâ? Or is it damaging, like âHarold Bing mugshotâ?
Look at online news stories or reviews about you or your company, if applicable. Check local sites or other social media.
Set up a Google Alert in your name, so that youâll be notified any time something new is posted., Programs like Google Suggest reflect real internet searches and should give you an idea of how people associate your name and reputation online. Did you find something unwelcome in your results? There are some things you can do.Do not try to manipulate the results. While some people suggest this approach, using techniques like crowdsourcing,you might end up causing more damage.
You might try acquiring the search term and building an optimized page to tell your viewpoint. That way, when someone types âJuliette Page embezzlerâ she is directed to your side of the story â that the charge is false, misunderstood, or not reported right.
You can also request that the search engine take down the autocomplete. This is hard and usually only works with results that suggest hate or violence, porn, or personal information. Still, it may be worthwhile to try.

, Your online reputation could get out of control. Donât despair, however. There are people and agencies who can help you manage this kind of situation, like Reputation.com or BrandYourself.com. The work will be pricy, but it may just salvage your working reputation.Reputation managers wonât always be able to get rid of negative content from the web. But they should be able to highlight positives about you.
For example, their services might include setting up a domain in your name for a page presenting your side of the story.
They can also respond to negative comments or reviews and manage your online presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube.
The goal is not to eliminate all negative info about you, but to tip the balance in your favor whenever someone searches for you online.Keep in mind that management services donât come cheap. Expect to pay between $20 to $200 per month.

Proofread your template.",How to Take Minutes," If the secretary is expected to take formal minutes, ask whether the group follows Robert's Rules of Orders or a different guide. In more informal settings, ask what should be included in the minutes or how they will be used.


As the minutes taker, you do not need to familiarize yourself with the full Rules of Order. However, acquiring a copy (or borrowing the chairman's) can be useful for answering specific questions.
Know your role as well. Some minute secretaries do not participate in the meeting, while others take minutes while contributing to the discussion. In either case the secretary should not be someone who has another major role, such as chairman or facilitator., Each meeting's minutes will contain much of the same information. A template creates one consistent format for ease of reference.Include space for the following information at minimum.


Name of organization.
Type of meeting. Is this a regular weekly or annual meeting, a smaller committee meeting, or a meeting convened for a special purpose?
Date, time, and place. Leave space for the start and end times (convening and adjourning).
Name of chairman or meeting leader & name of secretary (or their substitutes).
List of ""attendees"" and ""apologies of absentees"". This is a fancy term for attendance sheet. Note whether a quorum is present (the number of people sufficient to carry out votes).
Space for your signature. As the minute taker, you will always sign your work. An additional signature may be required when the minutes are approved, according to your organization's policies.
An agenda, if provided one. If the chairman or meeting facilitator has not asked you to draft the agenda, they should have one available upon request. Having one to refer will help you organize your meeting notes.

, Make sure that whatever you bring is something you are comfortable with. If you will be writing minutes often, set aside a notebook for this purpose, or create a folder on your computer.


If you took minutes at an earlier meeting and they have not been submitted for approval, make sure to bring those with you as well.
While an audio recorder can help you transcribe the minutes later, it is not a substitute for note taking. If you do record the meeting, make sure everyone present consents and do not give in to the temptation to create a word-for-word transcript.
Learning a shorthand will speed up note taking, but you do not need to be able to take down every word in order to take minutes. In fact, you should avoid doing so.
If you are asked to take notes publicly during the meeting, use an overhead projector or presentation easel. Make sure you are able to take the notes home afterward without smudging them so you are able to use them to type up minutes., As soon as everyone is in attendance, distribute a single piece of paper (more for very large meetings) with space for each person to write their name and contact information. You can use this after the meeting to fill out the attendees section of your template, or attach the sign in sheet itself to the completed minutes.


If you are unfamiliar with many of the people present, sketch a seating chart instead and fill it out as you ask everyone to introduce themselves. Keep it handy as you take meeting notes so you can refer to people by name when appropriate (as discussed below)., While waiting for the meeting to begin, record the name of the organization, the date and place of the meeting, and the type of meeting (e.g. weekly board meeting, a special committee meeting, etc.). When the meeting begins, note the start time.


If you don't have a template, record this information at the top of your meeting notes.
If the meeting was called for a special purpose or at a special time, save the notice sent out to notify members. You should attach it to the minutes after they're transcribed.

, Most formal meetings will begin with a motion to adopt an agenda, so this step will use that as an example. If the meeting begins with a different motion, just make sure to record all the same relevant information:


The exact wording of the motion beginning ""I move"". This will usually be ""I move for the adoption of this agenda.""
The name of the mover (person who proposed the motion).
The result of the vote. If the vote succeeds, write ""motion carried."" If it fails, write ""motion failed.""
You may ask lengthy motions to be submitted in writing if you cannot record them accurately. If this is a recurring problem, ask between meetings if this can be made official policy for motions above a certain number of words.If you drafted the agenda, you may be the mover of this motion as well as the minutes secretary. That's fine; as long as you remain objective there is no problem recording your own actions.

, Listen attentively to all discussions, but (unless instructed otherwise!) do not record them. When a new motion is made, record the relevant information.


Remember, each motion should include the exact wording of the motion, the name of the mover, and the result of the vote.
Some motions require a seconder before moving to a vote. If someone says ""I second the motion"" or similar, record that person's name as the seconder.
If you don't know the name of the mover or need the motion repeated, interrupt the meeting politely to ask. Recording information accurately is important enough to justify a small interruption.
If a motion is amended, simply alter the wording of the motion in your notes. Unless the amendment is controversial and provokes a lot of discussion, there is no need to record that an amendment occurred., Whenever a report, news bulletin, or similar item is read aloud, record the name of the report and the person reading it (or the name of the subcommittee that drafted it). If there is a motion attached, record it like you would any other motion.


It's most practical to obtain a copy at the end of the meeting. Make a note to ask the reader or meeting leader (chairman or president) for a copy afterwards. You'll attach a copy of each report to the minutes once transcribed.
If copies are not available, instead note where the original document is kept. You may need to ask for this information after the meeting.
If a member makes an oral report (instead of reading from a document), write a brief, objective summary of the report. Do not go into specific detail or quote the speaker verbatim.

, This includes ""check ins"" on the last meeting's assignments as well as new actions. Has someone been assigned to write a letter? Note their name and instructions.


Depending on how formal your meeting is, many of these actions may fall under the umbrella of ""motions"". For less formal meetings, you may need to keep your ears peeled for less clearly organized decisions as well.
Include a brief mention of the rationale behind a decision if one is given.

, Whenever an objection is made to a procedure, record the full objection and its basis, as well as the full ruling given out by the Chairman.


Be sure to include any references to Robert's Rules of Order, the organization bylaws, or company protocol.

, Officially, minutes are a recording of what was done, not what was said.However, fulfill any specific requests your organization makes of you.


When recording discussion, be as objective as possible. Include concrete points, not opinions, and minimize the use of adjectives and adverbs. Dry, factual, boring writing is your goal!Do not refer to people by name during the discussion summary. This is especially important during heated arguments that might cause offense.

, Record the time the meeting adjourned. Remember to pick up any copies of reports or remind someone to send them to you.


Skim your notes to see if there's anything missing or that needs clarification. If you need to ask someone a question, do so now before they leave.

, It's best to transcribe the official minutes immediately after the meeting, when events are still fresh in your mind., You may already have done this if you used a laptop at the meeting. Save your notes and begin a new document for the minutes so you can compare your notes and minutes side by side.

, Each new motion, decision, or point of order should be in its own paragraph. As you format them, check that you:


Use correct spelling and grammar. Use a spellchecker if you need to.
Use the same tense throughout. Use the past or present tense, but never switch between them in the same document.
Are objective as possible. Your own opinion should never be deducible from the minutes. You are trying to create an objective record for everyone to use.
Use simple, exact language. Any vague language should be replaced with precise wording. Flowery descriptions should be removed entirely.
Include only actions taken, not discussions. Unless you've been asked to record discussions, you should focus on what was done, not what was said.
Number the pages for ease of reference.

, Send a copy to each member using the contact information on the sign in sheet. If you don't have their contact information, the meeting leader should be able to reach them.

, You may be asked to read the minutes aloud at the next meeting and submit them for approval. If the motion passes, mark that the minutes were accepted.If the minutes are corrected before they are accepted, make the changes in the document and indicate at the end that the minutes were corrected. Don't describe specific corrections.
If a motion is made to correct the minutes after they have been accepted, include the exact wording of that motion in the relevant minutes and whether or not the motion passed.

, These pre-made templates will save you setup time organizing your minutes, and help prevent mistakes.

Understand the federal definition of âhostile work environment.â Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal laws, harassment is unwelcome conduct based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.,
Check if your employer is covered.,
Research state law.,
Recognize examples of a hostile work environment.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
Preserve all communications.,

Identify witnesses.,
Save performance reviews.,
Determine which agency you will report to.,
File a charge with the EEOC.,
Write a letter to the EEOC.,
File a charge with your state administrative agency.,

Prove the elements of a hostile workplace claim.,
Present evidence of harassment.,
Show that the harassment is pervasive or severe.,
Impute liability to your employer.",How to Prove a Hostile Work Environment," Unwelcome conduct becomes unlawful harassment when enduring the conduct becomes a condition of employment. It also is unlawful when it is so pervasive that the work environment becomes intimidating, abusive, and hostile.The test for whether a work environment is âhostileâ is whether it would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people. Petty slights and annoyances would not qualify. Nor would most isolated incidents of unwelcome conduct.Offensive conduct includes slurs, epithets, offensive jokes, physical assaults, threats, intimidation, ridicule, mockery, put-downs, insults, offensive pictures or objects.The offensive conduct must be based on a protected characteristic (such as race, gender, etc.) to violate federal law.The conduct must be so severe, reoccurring, or pervasive that it interferes with the employeeâs ability to do their job.;
, Federal anti-discrimination laws do not apply to all employers in the United States. Instead, an employer must have 15 or more employees (or 20 employees if alleging age discrimination)., If your employer is not covered by federal law, then it may be covered by an equivalent state law. Many states have anti-discrimination laws to cover employees not captured by the federal law. Furthermore, some state laws provide greater protection by prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.


To find state law, you can search in your local courthouse law library or on the Internet. To search the Internet, type your state and âantidiscriminationâ or âhostile workplaceâ into your web browser.

, A work environment may become intimidating, abusive, and hostile in a variety of ways. The harasser does not have to be the supervisor. Instead, harassers can also be co-worker, subordinates, or non-employees. Nor does the person complaining about the hostile work environment have to be the object of the harassment.A woman was awarded $8 million for egregious tormenting because she was a woman. She was trapped in a port-a-potty for 20 minutes on a hot day, regularly shown pictures of naked women, and ridiculed for working in a male-dominated industry.A waitress prevailed on a hostile workplace claim when two customers came into her restaurant and made filthy comments. On one occasion, one of the customers pulled her hair and then placed his mouth on her breast., To understand whether or not you have a legitimate hostile workplace claim, you should probably meet with a lawyer. A lawyer can help you identify whether the harassment rises to illegal conduct. To find a lawyer, contact your stateâs bar association. It should run a referral service.


You might want to meet with a lawyer who is a certified specialist in employment law. Not every state allows certification. But some states will certify specialists if they have dedicated a certain percentage of their practice to employment law. Applicants also must take advanced legal education classes and receive recommendations from other lawyers or judges. Lastly, applicants must pass a written exam to earn the certification.Employment litigation can be expensive. Usually, an employment case will cost between $8,000 and $30,000 in attorneyâs fees.You can discuss alternate fee arrangements when you meet with the lawyer for a consultation.
Usually, lawyers bill on an hourly basis. However, many employment attorneys will represent clients on a âcontingencyâ fee agreement. Under this arrangement, the lawyer gets paid a percentage of your award amount only if you win the case. Although you might still be responsible for paying court costs, such as filing fees and court reporters, a contingency fee agreement can make legal representation affordable., If emails, memos, letters, or voicemails contain harassing language, then you should make sure to preserve all of them. This evidence will be critical for proving a hostile work environment.


The communications do not need to have been made only in the workplace. If a co-worker or boss contacts you at home, then these communications are also relevant.Also preserve any communication where you inform a supervisor or Human Resources about the harassment. You will strengthen your case if you can show that you put your employer on notice about the harassment. A jury might view an employer who does not swiftly stamp out harassment as being complicit in the conduct. This helps show that the harassment is pervasive, as it seems to be approved by top management.

, If you are teased, harassed, or verbally abused, then you should write down important information about the incidents. The notes you take might be the only evidence that exists of these face-to-face taunts.

, You can strengthen your case if you have third parties who witnessed the harassment. Write down their names and the incidents that they observed. If they no longer work for the same employer, then try to get their contact information.


Share the witness information with your attorney. Your attorney will contact them and confirm that they are willing to testify. If they are unwilling, then your lawyer may have to subpoena the witnesses.

, Once you show offensive conduct, you will then need to show that you were impacted by it. For example, your job performance may have slipped as the harassment increased. You should preserve copies of your performance reviews if they show the steadily slipping performance once the harassment started.


Also save other evidence that shows the impact the harassment has had on you. You should keep all medical and psychiatric records that document the effect of the stress. You do not need to have a nervous breakdown before suing for a hostile work environment.However, proof of a negative physical or mental impact will certainly bolster your case.

, Federal antidiscrimination law applies to those employers who employ 15 or more employees (20 or more employees for age discrimination claims). If your employer is covered, then you can report a hostile work environment to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).If your employer is not covered by federal law, then you may report to your stateâs equivalent agency. If your employer is covered by both state and federal laws, then you can choose which agency to file your charge with. If your state's laws are more protective of employees than federal law, consider filing with your state agency. For example, California has more stringent workplace protections than federal law requires. If you live in California, you should consider filing a report with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.You should use the EEOCâs assessment tool at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/ to figure out which agency to file with.

, If you choose to report to the EEOC, then you can file a charge with any of its field offices. On the EEOC website there is a map of the 53 field offices around the country. You should contact the office nearest you. Some offices require appointments while others accept walk-ins. Call ahead of time and ask.


Donât wait to file. Generally, you have 180 days to file a charge with the EEOC. The deadline is extended if your state law provides a longer deadline. However, you shouldnât wait too long., If the nearest field office is too far away for you to visit, then you can file a charge by writing a letter. Make sure that the letter includes the following information:your name, address, and telephone number
your employerâs name, address, and telephone number
the number of employees employed there
a short description of the events you believe were discriminatory
when the events took place
that a protected characteristic was the motivation for the discriminatory events
your signature

, The exact process will vary from state to state. For example, in California, you must first file a âpre-complaint inquiry.â There are four different ways to do so:Call 800-884-1684 (or 800-884-1684 if deaf or hard of hearing).
Fill out and mail the Inquiry form to any Department of Fair Employment and Housing Office. The Inquiry form is available for download at http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/pciform.htm.
Email a completed Inquiry form to contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov.
Report by using the Departmentâs online system at http://app2.houdiniesq.net/dfeh/intake/.

, You can start your lawsuit by filing a complaint in the appropriate court. If you have a lawyer, they will draft it for you. The complaint alleges facts surrounding the work environment and asks the court for relief (such as lost wages or reinstatement in a job).


Generally, you will file in federal district court if you are suing under federal antidiscrimination law. If you are suing under your stateâs antidiscrimination law, then you will file in a state court.
In order to bring suit, you need a âNotice of Right-to-Sueâ letter from the administrative agency that you filed your initial charge with. The EEOC will issue the letter after conducting its investigation. You have 90 days to file a lawsuit from the date you receive your letter.If you want to sue before the EEOC has completed its investigation, then you will need to ask for the Right-to-Sue letter. At least 180 days must have passed since you filed the charge with EEOC. If so, then send a letter to the director of the office investigating your charge. The agency will close the investigation once it issues the letter., What you need to prove will differ slightly depending on the court you are suing in. Generally, to prove a hostile workplace claim you must show that:you were harassed because of a protected characteristic
the harassment was unwelcome
the harassment was so pervasive or severe as to create an abusive work environment
there is some basis to impute liability to the employer

, The hardest part of a hostile workplace claim will be proving that the harassment happened âbecause ofâ your protected characteristic. In other words, your race, age, gender, religion, etc. must have been the motivation for the harassment.Offensive, vulgar, and abusive statements unrelated to your protected characteristic will not qualify.


For example, you may have been called a âdwarfâ or âhalf-witâ by a boss. However, if you are claiming gender discrimination, then these comments will not help you as there is no logical connection between them and gender.However, misogynist or racial epithets would qualify. On their face, these kinds of comments about a group are offensive and related to the protected characteristic.
To prove harassment, you will need to introduce relevant evidence that you have gathered: emails, notes, documented conversations. Also, witnesses can testify as to what they heard or saw.

, To prove this element, you need to do more than show that you were personally offended. This kind of âsubjectiveâ evidence is necessary but not sufficient. Instead, you must prove that the harassment was so pervasive or severe as to be âobjectivelyâ abusive. In other words, it must be abusive to a reasonable person in your position.There is no required number of incidents necessary to qualify as pervasive or severe. One episode of abuse can be sufficiently severe to make the environment hostile. For example, a single incident of sexual assault can qualify.No single factor is determinative. You can prove this factor by presenting all of the evidence of offensive comments, physical touching, or other abusive behavior.

, You can establish this element by showing that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment and the employer failed to take remedial action.

Here, your emails or letter to Human Resources reporting the harassment will help you prove this element.

, Try to think positively about your work, avoid negative-thinking co-workers, and pat yourself on the back about small accomplishments, even if no one else does.

, Stop being your own self-critic. Donât be too hard on yourself by feeling so stupid when you didnât meet your expectation of yourself.

Be intentional about the changes you make.,
Get the support of those in your organization.,
Communicate openly as much as possible.,
Acknowledge the process of change.,
Model a positive response to the organizational change.",How to Manage Organizational Change," If you initiate change just for the sake of change, it will be challenging for you to get support from your leaders, employees, and clients. Have a good reason for each change and be able to explain those reasons clearly to your organization.


Keep your whole organization in mind. It is easy to think about making a change in one department without realizing the effects it will have on all the others. Explore all the potential consequences of organizational change before announcing it.
Get feedback from leaders in the organization, as well as from others outside of the company. Different perspectives will help you make a well-informed decision.
Make role changes for a specific purpose. Organizational change often leads to an adjustment in roles and responsibilities. People are moved from one department to another or from one location to another. Do your best to handle these changes sensitively and intentionally.;
, This is vital to helping your organization transition and move forward with the changes you would like to implement. The more you can engage and include those in your organization, the better.


Explain the reasoning behind organizational changes instead of just announcing the change itself. People are more likely to support you if they understand why you made a particular decision.
Start with the senior leadership team. If your leaders do not support you, it will be difficult to get the support from the rest of the organization.
Include all employees. Everyone on staff needs to be committed to the new vision, mission, or whatever the change might be. Work to earn their support and dedication. Invite employees to help formulate the wording of the new vision statement.

, Inform employees of changes before they hear it from somewhere else. Utilize company email, all-staff meetings, newsletters, or whatever form of communication is most beneficial for the news you are sharing.


Share major changes face to face and then follow up with an email. This makes your announcement more personal. It also gives employees a chance to ask questions or clear up any confusion.
Communicate early and often. Keep employees informed throughout all aspects of your organizational change so they can be on your side when the change actually takes place.
Encourage feedback. Give employees the opportunity to ask questions or provide suggestions as your organization moves toward change.

, Change takes place in several stages. There are also different emotions attached to the idea of organizational change.


Some workers will immediately accept announced changes, while others may deny the need for it, prolong the change itself, or actively resist it. As your company encounters change, keep an eye on how employees are responding.
Do not expect behavior to change all at once. It will take time for your employees to get used to doing things differently. Do what you can to support them during the transition.

, Employees often take the lead from their supervisors. Set the example by displaying a positive attitude about upcoming changes, supporting your own leaders, and helping your team make changes. If you have any disagreements about potential changes, keep that within the leadership team.

Have particularly troubled departments evaluated by a third party.",How to Manage Personality Conflicts at Work," Some conflicts arise as a direct result of individual workers' propensities toward certain behaviors or perspectives. Personality conflicts arise when personalities conflict with the demands of a worker's job. Managers and supervisors may be able to give you a good idea of where personality conflicts are showing up in the workplace.


Co-workers may have personality conflicts if they both approach the same job with different expectations. While both may know how to do the job, each may think of the task differently. Each person's perspective of their job performance is colored by their personality. When people do not see eye-to-eye, especially if each believes they are correct and the other should change, personality conflicts will ensue.
Personality conflicts between subordinates and supervisors can be troublesome if not dealt with quickly.Personality conflicts go beyond efficiency expectations. When a personality conflict of this nature is not dealt with the subordinate may feel unjustly attacked and quit leaving the department or shift understaffed. Furthermore, this may hide the fact that the personality conflict existed in the first place. Exit interviews are critical to finding and resolving these issues.;
, Some occur due to unrealistic expectations or bigotry. When a conflict is present but the employee is completing all of their work in a satisfactory manner, then a personality conflict may likely be the culprit. You should resolve the conflict before the stress of the conflict starts impacting performance. Depending on the duration of the conflict, some performance issues may be a direct result of the weight of a long-standing conflict.

, Even when you presume that employees want to do well at their job, personality conflicts can arise contrary to those desires. Take time to investigate how personality testing can reveal previously unknown aspects of your employees' approach to work and life. These tests are designed to show more detail about a person's propensities than a job interview. These tests often give you a starting place to understand each employee better. Make sure your list is as brief as possible because other managers and supervisors may not want to read a lot of material.

, Different personality testing programs have different costs and benefits associated with them. This includes having employees spend time in testing and supervisors and managers spend time in training. Training supervisors and managers to appropriately use results is critical to addressing personality conflicts. Misuse of results may result in legal action or a loss of trust. The training time, as well as cost to test all employees, needs to be discussed and clearly planned out.


You may find the programs are too expensive for your business. The up-front cost of testing everyone may be high if few personality conflicts currently exist. You may want to consider testing on an as-needed basis. However, you will get limited results this way. Try not to test less than an entire department if going this route.

, If you already have rampant personality conflicts negatively impacting employee performance, this may be a great start to smoothing things over. This lets employees know they are valued and respected. It also shows you are serious about resolving issues fairly.


Even if you do not notice any personality conflicts, your employees may benefit from testing and subsequent interventions. Many interpersonal strategies for resolving personality conflicts revolve around avoidance. Conflicting co-workers avoid each other and keep quiet. This can have a negative impact on performance and morale while appearing to be a non-issue. Unfortunately, avoidance leads to passive aggressive behavior if not worse.

, One of the most important aspects of managing personality conflicts is to identify the sources of conflict. If you've eliminated the obviously problematic sources of difference such as politics and religion then personality conflicts may arise at a myriad of levels. Everything might be going smoothly if you are only looking at efficiency. So using personality tests will help pinpoint the sources of conflict you may not be considering.

, One of the most important aspects of the process is showing employees they are valued. This means using business time to administer and take the evaluations. Avoid giving them homework as this will make them feel as if you don't respect their private life.


When it is impossible to stop the clock for people during their shift to allow for the evaluation consider giving them additional paid-time to come in and complete the evaluation. Offer them the option to do it before or after their shift or during another time the office is open.

, The results may show individuals areas they need to work on. They may also help supervisors see where personality conflicts may be impeding performance.


A critical element of successfully using these testing tool is training. Supervisors and managers should be tested and trained to understand and utilize the results in the most efficient manner.
Where supervisor and subordinate personality conflicts occur, distribution of results should be more cautious. Managers may need to be involved to deal with the department or shift if the supervisor's behavior is in question. Once the supervisor's behavior is addressed, they may better manage the personality conflicts of their subordinates effectively.

, For example, write your name on a piece of paper. Then write the names of people you directly talk to daily, weekly, or monthly. Draw a line from you to them. Repeat for the the process for each person in the business. This helps you identify which people frequently communicate with each other and need to work well together. Many personality conflicts exist between people operating in different company positions. Different positions, by their very nature, attract people with different personalities.

, By understanding who communicates with who on a daily or weekly basis you can use personality profiles to predict where personality conflicts may exist. You are looking for places in your network where two conflicting personalities communicate frequently. This will highlight potential areas for improvement. Some personality conflicts are hidden by avoidance. Some potential conflicts may simply turn out to be frequent miscommunication. Others may be a powder keg waiting to explode.

, It is inevitable that there will be conflicts at some points in nearly any workplace. Not all are personality related.Some will work out on their own, but some will not. If any conflict seems to be escalating or impeding performance you need to deal with it. Use personality profiles to identify potential conflicts. Then move toward addressing performance issues in light of that knowledge. If you see a personality conflict exists, your work toward mending the personality conflict may cause the performance issue to disappear. If you focus on the performance issue and ignore a personality conflict, the employee may quit when an improvement in performance is met with more conflict.

, When you evaluate the personality types within a social network you may see multiple areas where two different personalities need to work together. If these are conflicting personality types you will want to inquire if there is any conflict to address. Even when people are not yelling and screaming, a cold shoulder or ignored email can negatively impact the business. Use personality assessments to show you where you should be looking to see where hidden conflicts could be impacting efficiency.


Rather than openly discussing personality conflicts when they may not exist, ask workers to focus on areas of improvement. You don't want to create conflicts where they don't exist by highlighting personality differences. By using individual requests based on personality profiling you can ask quiet people to interact more with co-workers and domineering people to share more responsibility with their co-workers.

, Develop policies that help employees express their grievances in private. By giving employees an opportunity to voice their displeasure you may find patterns in department relationships. You may see that one person is creating a toxic environment. Keeping any discussion of issues anonymous is a must to avoid backlash and retaliation.


Reporting policies work best when third parties are involved. Human resource personnel are critical here. If subordinates and supervisors are conflicting, the subordinate can discuss the issue to a different department. When they human resources department steps in to resolve an issue, the subordinate's identity can be protected.

, If you can see that certain personalities may be conflicting within a department or shift then team building exercises may help resolve potential issues. Team building exercises typically involve more communication than normal. This provides people with more opportunity to resolve personality conflicts by discussing differences in opinion during trivial tasks. Furthermore, you may see personality conflicts flare up you didn't notice before. Those conflicts you can then address later.

, Toxic work environments typically involve severe personality conflicts that hamper performance. If employees at any level resist interventions to resolve personality conflicts and continue to stir up trouble it may be time to terminate their employment. Serious issues may turn into harassment and legal issues. Morale is driven low and good employees may quit for no reason other than to find a job they enjoy.


Interview employees who have witnessed unacceptable behavior regarding the conflict. Document issues and their dates to show whether the employee is trying to improve or continuing to engage in personality conflicts.
Write individual letters of reprimand to each employee, including exact details, and the company policy which applies to the situation. This documentation is vitally important to avoid a wrongful termination lawsuit. Check written company policy for the required number of warnings an employee may receive prior to dismissal from their job. Ensure that each employee is made aware of the policy and the legitimacy of each warning.
Have employees sign a statement of facts relevant to the situation, including their acknowledgment of the possibility of being terminated if the situation cannot be reconciled. Be careful of wording in these statements. If any wording is in question, have a lawyer review the wording to prevent wrongful termination lawsuits.

, When a group of co-workers develop a toxic work environment you need to address the issue more forcefully. Third parties (typically Employee Relations Specialists) can come in and give presentations and interviews for the purpose of finding and resolving conflicts. As a third party they are neutral arbiters whose advice should be considered fully. Typically a toxic environment is created by issues at multiple levels (i.e., managers, supervisors, and employees) so improvements should be expected at all levels.

Realize that this isn't about you exactly.,
Consider your workplace.,

Tone down your wardrobe.,
Do not be yourself if being yourself means being ""weird"" in the eyes of others.,
Tone down the desk environment.,

Keep your more unusual traits, abilities and habits to yourself.,
Avoid trying to turn the workplace into school.,
Come to work having taken care of your hygiene.,
Make plans to make your own change.",How to Not Be Weird at Work," This will vary depending on who you are and mostly on how others around you perceive weirdness. Remember that every workplace is different and the context matters a great deal as to whether or not any behavior and action is considered weird. In the the workplace, weirdness might incorporate one or any combination of the following:


Dressing in bright colors, or provocatively, or dowdily, or over-the-top, or too casually.
Decorating your work space with too much personal stuff, such as many baby or pet photos, hanging up handcrafted items you made at home, hanging punk rock posters everywhere, turning the cubicle into a shrine, etc.
Talking too loudly all the time, wanting to tell jokes to coworkers all day long, winking at people, interrupting people on a deadline to tell them long-winded stories, etc.
Bringing stinky lunches to work and heating them up in the workplace kitchen, then eating at your desk while others are still trying to work.
Bringing your pet to work when it's not Bring Your Pet to Work Day.
Insisting on leaving your bicycle in your cubicle when the workplace has a bike holding area downstairs.
Refusing to join the others for workplace morning or afternoon teas, Christmas parties, etc.
Refusing to contribute to whip around fundraising for workplace events and coworker's personal events (such as births, retirement, leaving, etc.).
Coming into work obviously sick. Not only weird but very unfair to others who might catch it.
Deliberately staying later than everyone else even though you're not actually doing anything productive.
Insert your own definitions, conceptualizations and ideas .;
, It's about workplace harmony, conformity and smooth running. Anything different, anything that disturbs the status quo, can threaten to upend tradition and habit, which hold the systems and standards together so that people don't have to keep thinking too hard about the tasks being performed. This doesn't mean your coworkers aren't thinkingââthey sure areââit just means that the systems already in place tend to be things your coworkers are wed to, and find easier to keep using than to have disrupted. They know their jobs well, inside out even, and if they feel that weird behavior might slow them down or hold them up, it is going to be trying for them.

, Some workplaces actively encourage you to ""be yourself"", weirdness and all. That's because those workplaces value the quirky and are probably very creative and liberal spaces to be in. On the other hand, the majority of workplaces are not quite so liberal and many are downright conservative by nature and expect employees to toe the line. This includes wearing conservative or toned-down clothing, avoiding too much in the way of personalizing your work space and not challenging existing systems. If this is your style of workplace, acting weirdly can cause you to seem like a bad fit, and may harm your promotion prospects or even cost you your job.

, Do they like a good laugh now and then or are they always heads down and completely focused on the tasks they're responsible for? Your first hint that acting weirdly is out of place is to see how coworkers react when you behave in certain ways. Pick up the cues from their initial reactions and decide not to repeat that behavior again while at work.


Notice when coworkers seem impatient, annoyed, barely tolerating the behavior or ignoring you.
Be attentive when a coworker speaks frankly about the behavior to you.
Be alert to coworkers' eyes glazing over when you talk to them about Mittens the kitten for the forty-eighth time this week.
Read the annoyance in the emails sent to you about continuously forwarding jokes to your coworkers and heed to message to stop.

, Sure, you may love the bright colors, the flirtatious curves, the no-tie look or the leopard prints but if they're not the best fit for your workplace, they will get you labeled as ""weird"". Notice what your coworkers are wearingââthat sets the scene for everyone else. Fall into line. You can wear your fun clothes outside of work.


This doesn't mean complete conformity. If everyone is wearing a black suit, you can still wear a bright tie or scarf to enliven it.

, One of the least helpful pieces of advice is to ""be yourself"", no matter the occasion. This has resulted in the downfall of many an anti-authority respecting, deeply creative or gleefully bright person who fully believes that one must be true to oneself no matter the occasion. The problem with this attitude is that there are plenty of places where it's just better to be what is expected of you than to let your real self hang out in style. A conservative or run-of-the-mill workplace is where it is better to just act professionally and put on your brave mask. You can be yourself everywhere else but when your income depends on it, be what you need to be to get that money banked. Remind yourself that it's all for the cause of being yourself outside of hours.


Dial your eccentricities down a notch and keep relationships with co-workers formal. This, of course, need not apply to relationships with other weird office workers. However, keep those interactions for break time, not during work time.

, Bringing your own tent into the office for nap time is usually frowned upon. Posters of death metal bands is similarly disapproved of. Creating an homage to your family and pets by covering the cubicle walls top to bottom with photos is considered unusual. Staplers, paper, pens, and a laptop are more acceptable in this area.

, While advertising agencies and Silicon Valley start-ups might actively value the thinker who stares off into space, most workplaces prefer to see you with your head down, scribbling, typing, rearranging, reformatting, phoning, emailing, being actively swamped in work action. Most offices do not allot time for daydreaming, ceiling staring and make believe. Keep this for evenings and weekends outside of the office.

, Your friends get it, your family has already embraced it. But your coworkers? They're another tale altogether and may just find this one oddity too far and could be compelled to use it to your disadvantage. If you are lucky enough to have some freak of nature ability, it is probably best if you don't share it with everyone at your staff meeting. Especially if your boss is one of the normal ones., As much as the endless routine, the Prussian strictness and the unending deadlines suggest school to you, the pranking, skiving off and truancy parts of school are definitely not part of the workplace. Moreover, your normal coworkers do not want to, and may never want to, make up a secret language with you. There are websites and out-of-workplace friends for that.

Avoid stirring up rebellionââyour coworkers first thought is always their mortgage, their car, then the school fees. Change is for the change agents and is something to be introduced with care and over time. If you stir the pot too much, you might find yourself being closely watched as a troublemaker.

, Coworkers deserve cleanliness from one another. As the school kids say, ""wear deodorant"". And do your personal hygiene things at home or in the bathroom at work. After all, nobody wants to watch you clip your toenails at work., If this has all seemed a bit much, perhaps a tad facetious, realize that few workplaces encourage personal expression. This is why people start their own businesses, become entrepreneurs or hunt down the workplaces that foster and celebrate creativity, uniqueness and any shade of ""weirdness"". If you feel that your workplace is truly stifling the person you'd rather be between 9 to 5 and any other hour you've dedicated to work, then maybe it's time to find an alternative route and to find that place that lets you truly be... yourself."

Establish a team.,
Define your target group.,
Conduct your analysis.,
Set goals.,
Establish a time-frame.,
Clarify who is accountable for success.,
Analyze your workplace.,
Create a job description.,
Recruit a diverse applicant pool.When you recruit applicants, distribute your job posting internally, externally, and with your constituents.This ensures that qualified individuals within your organization have the opportunity to apply for advancement; that your supporters will have a chance to apply; and that the public at large will see the posting.,
Eliminate identifying marks on applications.,
Use a panel to interview candidates.,
Identify your own biases.,
Foster open and trusting relationships.,
Evaluate your workplace policies.,
Monitor your metrics.,
Manage your supply chain.",How to Manage Gender Diversity in the Workplace," When you start the process, find a team of individuals within your workforce to set these targets.The team should consist of a diverse group of individuals from all departments. Include executives, human resources employees, administrative personnel, and others. The group should consist of men and women from all walks of life.


The more diverse the team, the more viewpoints and opinions you will receive.;
, Identify a group, or groups, for which you will be setting the targets. The target groups need to be clearly defined and identified. Be aware and work through different units of your company.


For example, a target of 50% females might be achievable in an executive unit of your corporation, but may be less achievable in a manufacturing unit. Recognize these challenges and confront them.
Try having each department (or group) set their own goals. Each target group will then have a goal associated with it., Analyze every aspect of your business with the aim of identifying actions, activities, or changes that need to be made in order to be successful. Focus on departments and processes responsible for hiring and retaining talent.


Ask yourself what your company does well in working towards gender equality. Finding these positive areas will help you to build on them and recreate them where needed. For example, if your hiring department screens applicants with a great eye towards gender equality, pass that successful trait down to your talent retention or promotions team.
Also look at what is holding you back. Identify barriers and consider ways to overcome them., When you are ready, set gender targets. Use your analysis to set gender goals for any are of your business where you feel it is necessary. These targets should be clearly identified, monitored, and evaluated.

, It is not enough to set goals. You also need to establish a time-frame for success. Take a long-term perspective in order to make sure your targets are realistic and achievable. You need to allow time for your changes to be implemented.


Five years is usually a good time-frame to strive for., When you make someone (or a group of people) responsible for the success or failure of your gender equality targets, the targets are more likely to be met. Make the person you choose responsible for measuring, monitoring, and reporting on the targets.


For example, have the responsible parties create quarterly reports. Also, make sure your responsible parties get together on a regular basis to discuss what is working and what is not., Once you have created targets, analyze your workplace over time. Whether you are an established company or just starting your business, create and analyze the following checklist. It will help you determine if you have (or can create) the management commitment and resources and systems required to support the achievement of your targets. The checklist will include:


Leadership commitment: all levels of management (including the CEO and other executives) need to be committed to gender equality at all levels.
Strategic intent: gender equality should be accepted as a business imperative (much like workplace safety is). Also, your gender equality strategy should be integrated with your overall business strategy.
Stakeholder management: you need strategies for communicating your targets and key stakeholders (i.e., your human resources department) need to be engaged with the process.
Accountability: your organization has a clear understanding of who is responsible for the success of your gender equality program.
Measurement and reporting: your company needs tools to monitor and evaluate progress and impacts. Also, you need to make a public disclosure in your annual reports pertaining to your progress.
Organizational culture and systems: your company needs to have reviewed and amended policies and processes to encourage gender equality. Some areas to look into include recruitment and selection, performance management, pay, training and development, and talent identification., With the hope of bringing more diversity to your workforce, develop an overall hiring strategy that is blind to gender. Start by creating a job description that is gender neutral. Do this by referring to the possible candidate as ""he or she"", ""you"", or do not use pronouns at all. In addition, specify the need for skills to work effectively in a diverse environment. For example, your job posting could include a requirement that the candidate ""have a demonstrated ability to work effectively in a diverse work environment."",


When you choose where to place your posting, consider factors that may affect who will see it. For example, if you place your job posting in an issue of Men's Health magazine, the likelihood is low that you will get a lot of female applicants (the opposite of this is also true).

, Think outside the box when considering ways to eliminate gender as a hiring factor. For example, break up your hiring team into two sections. Have the first section look through all of the application materials and remove any marks that could identify an applicant's gender (e.g., names).Then, have your second team look over the applications and pick out the best candidates.

, When it comes time to interview prospective employees, use a panel of interviewers. Make sure your panel includes people from different units, job classifications, lengths of service, and life experiences. This will help eliminate bias from the selection process.


Have your interviewers discuss the interview process and the questions that will be asked prior to conducting any interviews. This will ensure the team has an opportunity to raise any concerns they may have., Be honest with yourself throughout the hiring process. Recognize that everyone has biases, whether intentional or not. What stereotypes do you have about how different genders perform different jobs? What you may consider to be appropriate or desirable traits may actually reflect more about your personal preferences than about the skills needed to perform the job., Your workplace should engage employees and allow for open and honest discussions. If a female or male is worried about speaking up in their workplace, there is less of a chance your workforce will diversify over time. If you create open, trusting, and supportive relationships between employees and management, you will allow everyone to speak their minds. In turn you will enable employees to turn their differences into innovative ideas and processes.You can do this by adhering to an open door policy and by encouraging everyone to speak openly and freely. Hold monthly meetings where employees are given an opportunity to speak up and address concerns. Make it a stress free environment and even consider having these discussions over lunch or outside of the office.

, Certain policies are often seen as female driven. These types of policies include maternity leave, childcare, and flexible working. Do not make these policies solely about women. Instead, open up these policies to everyone in the office. Go over your existing policies and check for gender biases. If a program is skewed towards one gender, change it.


Policies that single out one gender can actually put more pressure on that gender, which should not happen. For example, flexible working policies often target women and actually apply social pressure to divide their life between work and family. These types of policies suggest to men that they do not need to worry about childcare or flexible working hours. In reality, men need these policies as well., Measure things like the average income of men and women; the percentage of men and women in certain positions; and the percentage of promotions given to men and women. Using these metrics you can evaluate the success of your policies and whether you need to change., Do not only require diversity in your own ranks. Look at other companies you deal with regularly and ask them to require diversity as well. Consider setting standards that require any company you work with to strive for gender diversity. You may even want to urge your partners to adopt gender policies."

Calculate the overpayment.,
Send the employee written notice.,
Discuss the issue with the employee in person.,
Have the employee sign an acknowledgement of overpayment.,
Arrange to have the overpayment deducted from future paychecks.,
Consider other options.,
Maintain accurate records.,
Notify human resources of changes immediately.,
Audit payroll records regularly.",How to Handle Accidental Overpayments," As soon as a possible overpayment is noticed, you must review the employee's payroll and related records to determine what the employee should have been paid, and the difference between what the employee should have been paid and what the employee was paid.Try to find the source of the problem so you can correct it and keep it from continuing to happen. This also will help you determine whether it was a one-time thing or has happened on several paychecks.
If it turns out the employee has been overpaid over the course of several paychecks, you must determine the date when the error was introduced so you can determine the extent of the overpayment.;
, Once you know the exact amount the employee was overpaid, give the employee a letter stating that they were accidentally overpaid and providing a calculation of the amount the employee owes you.Write a brief letter in business format stating that according to your records, the employee was overpaid. List the specific amount as well as the dates of the paychecks that included an overpayment.â¨
Set a date and time at which you want to meet to discuss the options available to the employee to return the amount he or she was overpaid.
You may want to attach proof of the overpayment, or you can provide this information to the employee at his or her request.
Sign and date the notice, then make a copy of it for the employee's personnel file.

, After you give the employee written notice, arrange a meeting with him or her to figure out what arrangements can be made to get the accidental overpayment back.Before the meeting takes place, review your state's laws on deducting the pay from the employee's paycheck. Typically you are allowed to do this, but not without the employee's knowledge and consent.
Arrange a meeting with the employee in private to talk about various options for paying back the overpayment.
If the employee expresses reluctance to repay the money, remind them that they have a legal duty to return the money, just as you would have a duty to pay them if their paycheck was short.

, Getting a signed, written acknowledgement from the employee protects you in the event you have to deduct money to cover the overpayment from the employee's check without his or her consent.Written acknowledgement also protects you if the employee claims you took too much out of future paychecks. Make sure you include the amount of overpayment on the acknowledgement form.
Make a copy for the employee to keep for their records, and retain the original in the employee's personnel file along with your original notice.

, If the employee is unable to pay the money back right away, you may be able to get his or her agreement to take money out of the next paycheck to cover the amount of the overpayment.Federal law permits you to withdraw the entire amount from the employee's next paycheck, even if the amount would cut into the minimum wage or hours the employee must be paid.
However, some states limit the amount you can withdraw from each paycheck. Depending on the amount you overpaid the employee, this may mean you have to take a smaller amount out of several paychecks to make up the difference.
You also may be able to work out an agreement with the employee to take out a certain amount each paycheck until the overpayment is returned without causing the employee financial difficulties.
If you make an agreement with the employee, make sure you get it in writing. Sign it and have the employee sign it, then make a copy for the employee's records and keep the original.
Keep in mind that you cannot legally charge the employee interest on the amount owed, regardless of how long it takes you to collect the overage.

, If the employee refuses to pay the money back or is causing difficulty, you may have to terminate the employee or even sue them to get the money back that you accidentally overpaid them.Terminating the employee won't get your money back, but the threat of termination may encourage the employee to be a little more cooperative â especially if you remind them that it will be a termination for cause, which may mean they aren't eligible for unemployment benefits.
If the employee refuses to return the amount you overpaid, this technically is considered theft. You can file a lawsuit in civil court to recover the money, but depending on the amount of overpayment, it may not be worth it, given the time investment, attorney's fees, and court costs.
Some states don't allow business entities to file a lawsuit in small claims court. However, if your state does and the amount of overpayment falls below the small claims threshold, this can be a quicker way to get a court order for your money.
Keep in mind that even if you get a court order, you still have to enforce the judgment. One of the most common methods of enforcing money judgments is to garnish wages.

, Accidental overpayments are more likely when employees cash in vacation time or sick leave. Both employees and employers can help prevent these overpayments by double-checking accrual of hours periodically.If leave is requested, check all records prior to granting the request to make sure the employee has accrued enough time to cover the request.
Make sure the hours are checked before you forward the request to your payroll department for processing. If the incorrect number of paid hours are sent and then have to be changed, this can result in an overpayment.
As an employee, check your pay stubs regularly to make sure your accrued time is being credited appropriately. If you see an error or believe you've accrued more (or less) time than is listed, let your manager or someone in human resources know.

, If an employee is transferred to a different department or shift, that change could potentially result in an over- or underpayment. For this reason, payroll records should be updated so the change is reflected on the first applicable paycheck.If there isn't already one in place, establish an efficient communications system for relaying changes.
There should be one person in charge of processing payroll changes, so a second employee doesn't inadvertently undo a change that was made, or enter an adjustment more than once.
Include a verification process so your payroll department notifies both the manager who requested the change and the employee involved when changes are made and the date on which they will be effective.

, Regular audits can reveal issues that were overlooked, such as a terminated employee who received an extra paycheck or time card discrepancies that could result in potential payment errors.Set up a routine audit system and assign the task of auditing to an employee who doesn't regularly handle payroll records.
If an error is discovered through auditing, correct the problem immediately and determine how much over- or underpayment was made so you can remedy the situation.
Employees should be notified of errors uncovered during an audit, even if the error doesn't have any effect on the amount of money the received or will receive.

Be aware that there are several laws in place to protect employees from being disciplined or terminated wrongfully.,
Understand the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).,

Enforce attendance rules.,
Keep an eye on attendance.,
Praise your employee.,
Consider disciplinary action.",How to Handle an Employee's Attendance Problems," Before you begin the process of addressing employee absence, make sure that you are adhering to the law.;
, The purpose of FMLA is to protect employees from disciplinary action when major life events occur. Be aware that while these employees are protected under this act, the employee must provide notice that he will be absent from work for one of the reasons protected under FMLA, and documentation must also be provided (e.g. doctorâs note, evidence of adoption, etc.).This includes the birth of a child, caring for a newborn child up to the ago of one year.
Adopting a child and caring for a newly adopted child during the first year.
Caring for a parent, spouse or child with a serious health condition
Being unable to perform job duties as a result of a serious health condition.
Emergencies arising from the child, spouse, or parent of an employee as a result of being involved in the military., If you have an employee with a disability, as an employer, you must provide accommodations so that he can perform his job without undue hardship.

If this applies to your employee, he may be missing work because he cannot perform his job properly, and may need assistance. Make sure that this is not the case before taking any disciplinary action.

Undue hardship is defined as, ""action requiring significant difficulty or expense"" when considered in light of a number of factors, including how much the accommodation will cost and its nature in relation to the size, available resources, nature of the work, and structure of the company., This act protects people from being discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, color, national origin, or religion.Like with the ADA, you should ensure that your employee is not absent from work because, for example, of a religious ceremony he must attend, before taking disciplinary action.

, This act protects service members rights to employment and reemployment upon returning from a period of service.If your employee has recently returned from a tour of service in the military, including the reserves and National Guard, he may be dealing with emotional issues, administrative issues, etc. that are preventing him from working.

, You are likely already familiar with what the company policy on attendance is; however, it doesn't hurt to refresh your memory, especially if you have to confront an employee about his attendance.

, This may be clearly outlined in your company policy, or you may have to determine it based on comparisons of other employees in similar working positions.Keep in mind that if your employee is covered by one of the laws discussed in Part 1, you may have to adjust accordingly.

, If the absent employee has demonstrated that he missed work because of a recurrent health problem, a disability, a death in the family, or jury duty, and particularly, and if he has provided documentation, such as a doctorâs note or note from the court, then the employee has a legitimate reason.


In this case, it is unlikely that you will need to take any disciplinary action. However, you can ask the employer to provide notice of when and how often he or she will need to take off work if, for example, the absences are related to a health problem. While it is not appropriate to ask for information or details about any diagnosis, it is fair to ask for documentation from the doctor so that you can plan around the needs of the employee.Be aware that what constitutes a legitimate excuse may be different in different situations. Take each reason on a case-by-case basis. If your employee has an explanation that you believe, and evidence to back it up, then give them the benefit of the doubt. You donât want your employee to feel as though he is distrusted and constantly needs to defend himself, as this can result in stress and dissatisfaction for the employee.
If your employee does not have good explanations or evidence for his absence, continue with steps to address the issue.

, Take some time to review the employeeâs performance and attendance history. If the employee has been with the company for several years and has been a stellar employee in terms of performance and attendance, then a new pattern of absence likely has a legitimate reason, or could indicate that the employee is no longer happy in his job.

, Try to do this discreetly, via email if possible. You donât want to embarrass the employee, particularly if they have good reasons for their absence., Calmly explain your concerns about their absenteeism to them. Simply state that you have seen a pattern in their absenteeism, and that you want to determine if these absences are legitimate, or if you need to work together to improve the issue. Avoid stating any suspicions you have about their absences, as this may cause the employee to become defensive.

, Give the employee a chance to explain his absences. Be aware that he may have to share very personal information with you about a family crisis or health issue, so do your best to be compassionate and patient.


Also be aware that he may not have a good excuse for his absence. In this case, you should still remain calm and concerned. It will not be helpful to scold the employee or make them feel even more embarrassed, particularly if you are interested in keeping them as an employee.

, Remember that it is not yours or the companyâs job to fix your employeeâs non-work related problems. Instead, your job is to provide them with the resources they need to do their job well., Explain that while absence is sometimes unavoidable, chronic absenteeism hurts the company and creates extra work for others. When your business is doing its peak volume, it's especially important for him to be there as scheduled. It can also create interpersonal conflict within the work team if people are picking up the slack for someone who does not adhere to the attendance policy.

, If you have determined that the employeeâs chronic absence is not related to legitimate issues, warn the employee that he needs to improve or face disciplinary action.Document the meeting and make it clear that a verbal warning was given. It is important to have evidence that you discussed the matter with the employee, and that it is clear what went on in the meeting. This could help avoid future disagreements about what went on and what did not.

, Otherwise, give him concrete guidelines about how his attendance will be monitored (e.g.he is not allowed to miss work for the next 6 months, or he will be disciplined). Be clear about which situations constitute legitimate reasons, and which do not.


Provide a company of the employee handbook, if applicable. Mark the page that contains the information about attendance, and the consequences of missing work.
Make sure the employee understands your policies on paid and unpaid leave. If he is entitled to sick time, vacation time or unpaid days off, explain that you need notice so you can adjust the schedule. He must call in sick at opening time to use a sick day, and provide a doctor's note, if your policy calls for this. Also explain who must approve any leave time; this could be you, or another supervisor, but be clear.

, Make sure your employee understands that he must work to improve his absenteeism, and that if he is unable to do so there will likely be consequences including possible termination from the job., Sometimes, absence can be a result of not wanting to deal with situations at work. Your employee may be being harassed by another employee, he may feel suffering from burnout, or he may feel dissatisfied with a particular aspect of his job.You may be able to help him deal with certain work-related issues, so take the time to see if you can do anything to improve the situation.

, Once you and the employee have discussed the problem, itâs causes, and how the both of you will work together to improve the problem, create a document that conveys this information. Include a statement explaining that the employee has understood the possible consequences if he does not improve as well as a place for signatures from you and the employee.


Ask your employee to read through the action plan and sign it. Explain to him that by signing the document, he is indicating that he understands the information contained in the document.
Make a copy of the document for the employee to keep, and place the original in the employeeâs file.

, Remind all employees of the rules and enforce whatever your policy dictates for disciplinary action. As a rule of thumb, give one or two reminders before writing him up.


Be consistent in your enforcement. If you look the other way sometimes but not others, or show favoritism toward some employees, you will create a chaotic environment where employees feel resentful and take advantage of your inconsistency.

, With a plan of action for improving the employee's attendance, you will need to make sure he is following through. Regularly check the employeeâs attendance records each month. While the employee may adjust his behaviour initially, he may fall back into old habits if he feels he can get away with it., If the employee is able to improve his performance, be sure to take time to give him praise. This way, he knows that you are paying attention, and that you havenât failed to notice his efforts.

, On the other hand, if your employee fails to improve his attendance, consider taking disciplinary action. This might mean providing a written warning, it may mean suspending the employee without pay for a period of time, or it may mean termination of the employee.


Deciding on the right kind of disciplinary action should be done by considering the history of the employee, the reasons for his absence, as well as your companyâs policy.

For instance, it could be something like, âHave you ever wondered what octopus eat?â Obviously, you want to relate it to the product you are marketing; nonetheless, something that is out-of-the-ordinary will catch a readerâs eye.
It doesnât even need to be very specific. Something like âTry this one strange product to clear your acneâ can also pique a readerâs curiosity. Another hook is to advertise a sale, such as 50% off certain items.
The best hooks are ones that are targeted to the reader. That is, if possible, itâs best to advertise products that you know the reader will like because he or she has looked at them in the past.

, In other words, show you are human. People appreciate talking to other people (not machines) and that comes across in emails. For instance, you donât have to start out âDear Sir or Madam.â You can try something as simple as âHello!â which is a bit friendlier.

, Make sure the email establishes what you are selling in the first couple of lines. That is, your readers should not be confused as to why they received the email. Get to the point quickly.

, The benefit is what makes up the bulk of the email. That is, you are trying to persuade the readers to buy something, but to do that, you have to convince them why to do it. Why would they want your product/service? Why is it special?

, Remember persuasive essays in grade school, where you wrote a paper trying to persuade your parents to give you a later curfew? Sales emails really arenât so different.


For instance, saying âThis product is the best.â may not persuade that many people. However, telling them why the product is good might, for example:
âThis product is unique, as no other product on the market has the same formula; it will get your dishes sparkling clean.â

, That is, get positive quotes from your customers about your product. Your reader will appreciate hearing what other people think of the product. You can ask customers for unbiased reviews on the website feedback form or through an email.

, Donât forget to tell the reader exactly what you want them to do at the end. You are spurring them into an actionâbuying your product!

, Keep it simple and to the point. If you really need a longer email to explain yourself, consider embedding a video in the email.

If your pay rate has changed since you signed your contract, look for documentation to verify that change, such as an email specifying your new pay rate, or pay stubs showing that your pay rate changed.;
, To demonstrate to your employer that you have been underpaid, and to ultimately bring a successful lawsuit, you will need to present evidence of how much you should have been paid, how much you were actually paid, and how much money you are owed. Gather your:


Time cards;
Pay stubs;
Bank statements (showing direct deposits);
Any communications with your employer regarding pay, such as an email confirming a raise; and
Your employment contract.

, The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour as of 2015.Your state or municipality can specify a greater minimum wage, but cannot impose a minimum wage lower than the federally-mandated minimum.There are some exceptions to the federal minimum wage, including farm workers on small farms, employees at seasonal and recreational establishments, and executives or salaried administrative professionals.There are also federal rules (and exceptions) for overtime pay. Federal law specifies that your employer must pay you 1.5 times your regular pay for every hour you work in excess of 40 hours each week. You can find the exception to both the minimum wage and overtime laws at http://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/screen75.asp.

, Your state or city may provide a greater minimum wage or overtime system. Your stateâs laws can be found by visiting the Department of Laborâs website at http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm. If your state law provides for lower compensation than federal law, then the federal law applies.Some states, including California and Nevada, require overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 8 per day. California also requires double pay for each hour you work after you have already worked 12 hours in a single day.California also requires that you receive 1.5 times your hourly wage for the first 8 hours you work on the seventh day if you work seven days in a row., Calculate how much you are owed by multiplying each hour you worked by the applicable wage (minimum, overtime, or your contractual wage). Then subtract the amount you were actually paid from the amount you should have been paid to find the still-outstanding unpaid amount.


For example, say that you worked 8 hours on Monday through Thursday, and 10 hours on Friday. Your boss paid you for 42 hours, but paid you $6 per hour, or $252. Under federal law, you deserve $7.25 per hour for the first 40 hours, and time-and-a-half for the last two hours of overtime. $7.25 x 40 = $290. $7.25 x 1.5 x 2 = $21.75. Thus, you earned $290 plus $21.75, for a total of $311.75. Your boss already paid you $252. $311.75 minus $252 is $59.75. Your boss still owes you $59.75.
See Calculate Overtime Pay for more information on calculating your overtime pay.
Don't forget to include taxes and other deductions and contributions.

, Before threatening or filing a complaint, ask your employer for your unpaid wages. Your employer's failure to pay your full wages may have been the result of an accounting error or a misunderstanding. If so, your employer may be happy to voluntarily pay you the discrepancy. Call, set up a meeting, or send a friendly email or letter (as opposed to a demand letter). Try not to take an argumentative tone before your employer gives you a refusal.


For example, you might raise the issue in this way: ""I was reviewing my records and I think there has been a mistake in the payroll department. I should have received $500 during the last pay period, but as you can see from this paystub, I was only paid $400. Would you please review this and have payroll correct the error?""

, A demand letter lets your employer know that if they do not respond, you will take legal action. When addressing your letter, send it to the person or department responsible for paying your wages. For example, if your supervisor is not responsible for paying employees, then address your letter to someone in management.


Demand letters can be very effective, because they demonstrate that the problem is not going to simply go away if the employer ignores it. You can also use the demand letter in court to show that your employer was made aware of the wage violation and that you tried to resolve the issue out of court.
A demand letter sent by an attorney may be more effective at getting the employer's attention. Consider hiring an attorney to draft a demand letter for you.

, In your letter, identify yourself by name and your position at the company. If you no longer work for this employer, state the date upon which you stopped working.

, Let your employer know approximately how much money you are claiming is still due to you. State the types of wages you are owed, whether they are minimum wage violations, overtime, or merely the amount specified in your employment contract.

, Let your employer know that if they do not respond by a specified deadline, you will take legal action to claim the money you are owed. For example, ""If I do not receive a response by Friday, October 30, 2015, I will take legal action to pursue my claim.""


You do not need to specify whether you intend to file a complaint with a government agency or take your employer to court.
You can find a sample demand letter at http://louisianalawhelp.org/resource/unpaid-wages-sample-demand-letter?ref=zR8UM.

, Be sure to keep a copy of the letter for your records. Send your letter via certified mail, return receipt requested, so that you have proof that the letter was delivered.

, If your employer does not respond by the deadline you specified in the letter, consider calling to verify that they received the demand letter. Once you are satisfied that your employer does not intend to cooperate, you are ready to take legal action.

, The Department of Labor (DOL) has the authority to investigate employers and recover unpaid wages on behalf of employees.Filing a complaint is free and confidential, and you can file even if you are an undocumented worker.To file a complaint with the DOL, call 1-866-487-9243 or contact your local DOL office. To find a local office, visit the DOL map at http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm. When you file, you must provide:Your contact information (name, address, and phone number);
Your employer's name;
The employerâs contact information (phone number and address);
Names of the managers or owners;
The type of work that you performed;
How and when you were paid (cash or check, every Friday or once a month, etc.); and
Any other evidence you have, such as pay stubs, records of your hours, and other information about the employer's payment practices., You may also file a complaint with your state's labor office if your employer violated your state's wage laws. To find your state's labor office, use the contact list created by the DOL, online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm.


The process for filing a complaint varies from state to state. However, many state agencies have pre-printed âfill in the blankâ wage claim forms for you to complete. If those forms are not available on the agency's website, contact the agency at the phone number listed on the DOL's contact list., The state or federal agency will investigate your claim. Typically, the investigation begins when the agency mails a copy of the wage claim to the employer and requests a response.In some states, the investigator will make a preliminary decision about the claim. This decision will become final unless the losing party appeals within the appeals deadline. In Texas, for example, the party has 21 days to object., You may also be invited by the agency to discuss settling with your employer. In California, for example, you would receive a notice from the labor commissioner with the date and time of a settlement conference. At the conference, you will have the opportunity to discuss your claim and try to settle the matter with your employer.Bring copies of any documents that support your position, unless you already submitted those documents to the agency when you filed your claim., If the agency determines that your claim has merit, but your employer will not settle, the agency will schedule a hearing. Both sides will be present evidence to a presiding judge or officer, who may ask questions to clarify the issues.Some states conduct these hearings by phone.Before the hearing, practice explaining the timeline of events, including when you were hired, what dates or periods you were not adequately paid, when you stopped working for that employer, and what steps you took to try to resolve the problem before filing the complaint with the state or federal agency.
Bring copies of your paystubs, time cards, letters, emails, and other documents. Organize them in binders for quick reference during the hearing.

, The administrative law judge who hears the case will make a decision, which will be mailed to you.If you lose, then you may have the right to file an appeal. The letter containing the judge's decision should include instructions on how to appeal the decision. If you still have questions about the appeals process, contact the agency that investigated your claim.

, Some states allow employees to choose between filing a civil suit in court or filing a complaint with the stateâs labor department. Other states require that you file a wage complaint with a state agency and then request a âright to sueâ letter.To find out whether you need a right to sue letter, call your state's labor agency at the number listed at http://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm.

, An employment law attorney can advise you on the merits of your case, and can represent you in court. See Find an Employment Lawyer for more information about hiring an employment lawyer.


Some attorneys offer consultations either for free or for a reduced fee. Call ahead to inquire about the office's consultation policy.
Note that your employer may be ordered to pay your attorney's fees if you win., Depending on the amount of money you are owed and the court rules in your jurisdiction, you may have the choice of filing in small claims court instead of regular civil court. Small claims court is used for disputes valued at a maximum of a few thousand dollars, and uses simplified rules of evidence to make it easier for parties to represent themselves. Some states do not even permit attorneys to represent clients in small claims. It may be more cost-effective for you to represent yourself in small claims court.

, A lawsuit begins when the you, the plaintiff, file a complaint against your employer, the defendant. In the complaint, you explain the facts of your situation and request relief from the court. Many courts provide pre-printed complaint forms.You may also need to complete a summons form and other court-specific documents. Ask the court clerk what other forms you need to include with your complaint.
If your court does not have pre-printed complaint forms ask the court clerk for information on how to draft a complaint yourself, or consult an attorney. Different states use different formats, but your complaint should resemble this sample from Florida: https://www.352law.com/unpaid-wages-complaint/.

, Make several copies of your forms and take the copies and original to the court clerk. The clerk will assist you in filing your case and stamping your copies as ""filed."" You will also be required to pay a filing fee, which varies from state to state. If you cannot afford the filing fee, ask the clerk for information about how to file a request for a fee waiver.

, Service is the process by which you notify your employer that you have sued them. Some courts permit service by mail, but generally you must arrange to have the defendant ""personally served"" (where the documents are handed to the defendant) by:


A professional process server;
The sheriff's office; or
Someone over 18 years old and not involved in the case.

, Your court should have pre-printed ""Proof of Service"" or ""Affidavit of Service"" forms. The person who served the defendant must complete and sign the form, verifying that he or she served the defendant. Take the completed form to the court clerk for filing., Your employer will have a deadline to file an answer to your complaint, typically 21 or 30 days. In the answer, your employer will admit or deny your allegations, and may assert legal defenses or justifications for not paying you. After the defendant files an answer, the court will schedule a hearing or trial.


Your employer also has the option of simply paying you to settle the case. If you are paid the money that you are owed, then you can ask the court clerk how to dismiss your lawsuit, which will require filing additional paperwork.
If your employer does not respond to the complaint, ask the clerk what forms you need to submit in order to request a default judgment.

, At the trial, each side will present evidence in support of their claims. The typical components of a trial include:


An opening statement. The plaintiff (or your attorney) will deliver a short opening statement, which summarizes the evidence the plaintiff will present. The defendant will also make an opening statement.
Witness testimony. Both sides will call witnesses to testify and discuss evidence. You will present your witnesses first, including your own testimony. Explain how much you are owed, how you calculated that amount, and why you believe your employer refuses to pay you.

If you have an attorney, the attorney will ask you questions to guide you through your testimony.
You can also bring other witnesses, such as coworkers who have knowledge of the dispute.


Cross-examination. Both sides can question the other's witnesses. Keep your answers short and truthful. Do not be afraid to admit that you do not know an answer.Closing argument. Both sides will get to summarize the information presented at trial.

, If you win, the judge will issue a judgment in your favor stating that the defendant owes you money. Hopefully, the defendant will voluntarily comply with the order, but collecting on a judgment can be difficult. It may be more effective to hire an attorney than to try to collect yourself.


When collecting on a judgment owed by a business, you can ask the court to authorize the garnishment of or placement of a lien upon the business's bank account. You may also get authorization for the sheriff to seize money from the register or other valuable property from the premises that can be sold to satisfy the debt.Ask the court clerk what forms you must file to request a garnishment, lien, or authorization for the seizure of the defendant's property.

Try to label what youâre feeling.,
Change your internal dialogue.,
Consider any constructive criticism you have received.,
Get help.",How to Handle Feeling Out of Place at Work1," Ask yourself what is keeping you from belonging. Co-workers sometimes hang out with their own age group by default and maybe youâre much older or younger. Perhaps you are a manager and feel excluded from your subordinates?Maybe everyone else has energy for the job, but youâre dealing with burnout. There even may be varying levels of lifestyles, values, or interests separating you and your colleagues.Sit down with paper and a pen and try to list whatever reasons come to mind. After you make a tentative list, you can spend a few days observing yourself and your peers at work to see if your reasons are accurate.;
, Sometimes, the biggest roadblock keeping you from connecting with people is in your own head. If you keep telling yourself you donât fit in, you wonât. Your thought patterns can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which what you believe about yourself becomes true.If youâre thinking you donât belong, youâre awkward, or people wonât like you, reframe your self-talk. Create a list of positive, realistic statements about your workplace connections, such as âI have much to offer as a friendâ or âI enjoy the culture of my workplace, so I am certain to find people with common interests.â

, If your boss or a peer has recently expressed concern that you are not a team player, dominate conversations, or bring a toxic competitive vibe to the workplace, you may need to dial it back to feel like a part of the group. If you shrugged off their feedback without trying to make positive change, they may be excluding you on purpose.


If this describes your circumstances, you have two options: you can stay the way you are and remain excluded or reflect on their feedback and find ways to improve. Itâs up to you, just know that if you choose to stay the same, you could be hurting your reputation and growth within your career., Your engagement at your job has a major influence on your career growth and life satisfaction. If you canât seem to identify whatâs keeping you from fitting in, you made need to seek out professional assistance.


If you are struggling with self-esteem issues or social anxiety, you should see a mental health expert.If you are dissatisfied with your choice of work or feel like your workplace does not align with your values, it may help to see a career counselor.Look into leadership or self-help workshops to get help with specific areas of personal development. One good option for leadership and self-improvement training is called Landmark Education."

Set a daily conversation quota.,
Focus on the other person, not on your own shyness.,
Donât turn down invitations.,
Ask a co-worker out for coffee or similar.,
Suggest to your boss the idea of workplace socials.,
Seek advice about purposeful exclusion.",How to Handle Feeling Out of Place at Work2," Not belonging doesnât feel good, so even if you donât make any major changes, it can still make you feel better to interact more often. Make a personal goal to have one or two conversations with a peer at work each day. Think of some conversation starters to make it easier.Increase your chances of conversing by hanging out with your co-workers more. If they eat in the break room, donât take your lunch at your desk or work-station. Join them. Then, listen to their discussion and participate when you have something of value to add.
For example, your co-workers are discussing vacation plans and one of them mentions a trip to a specific location. If you have an interest in that place, you might say, âThat sounds so exciting! What sorts of excursions are you planning during your visit?â

, If you are shy or hesitant about chatting it up with your co-workers, follow this rule-of-thumb: donât dwell on how shy you feel, turn your attention completely to the other person. Act as if you are serving them in a wayâtry to make them smile or laugh, get them talking about their own life.


When youâre worried about how youâre coming off to others, you might over-analyze and end up ruining a perfectly decent interaction. Take a break from focusing on yourself and devote your attention to the other speaker.Make sure to ask open-ended questions to keep the other person talking. These are questions that invite elaboration and that donât have a simple yes or no answer.
Be willing to share about yourself as well to keep the conversation going and to form a genuine connection.

, If youâre notorious for responding with ânoâ each time your peers invite you to lunch or to after-work drinks, theyâll quickly stop asking. No one wants to be rejected over and over again, so you may have inadvertently caused them to exclude you.


When you catch them discussing plans, ask if you can tag along. Or, if someone directly invites you, try to say âyesâ unless you absolutely cannot go.
Practicing saying yes to invites can improve your work life and your personal life. Accept a set amount of invitations per week and invite people to do things as well.

, If the group as a whole makes you self-conscious, target one particularly non-intimidating, friendly co-worker. Making just one social connection at work can help you feel less isolated. Plus, once this person gets to know you, they might encourage the others to do the same.Say something like, âHey, Carla, I enjoyed our talk earlier. Itâs refreshing to talk to another newbie mom. Would you like to get coffee together one morning before work?â

, If your workplace culture doesn't emphasize inclusion, you might not be the only one feeling left out. Make a recommendation to your superior to stimulate connectedness with group events. Plan a potluck lunch or dinner to celebrate a company victory. Start a baseball, cricket, soccer, netball or basketball team.

, Maybe your co-workers seem to have a vendetta against you, overlooking you for social outings and never including you in workplace gift exchanges. If this is the case, you will have to carefully consider how you choose to move forward. The best thing to do is to talk with someone you trust at your workplace about what has been happening. It can also help to first share your worries with a trusted friend.


You might say, ""I get the sense that I am the odd one out at work. They never include me. And they stop talking whenever I come around. What should I do?""
Even if you don't take your friend's advice, it can help to have some unbiased support.

Resist acting out to get attention.,
Set an objective workplace goal.,
Reevaluate the job.",How to Handle Feeling Out of Place at Work3," Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too., Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you canât strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards. This could be just what you need to feel passionate about your work and reconnect with the group.


For example, you might aim to get so many reports done by 5pm each day. Or, you might develop a track to move towards a promotion or transfer to a new company.Try to focus on what you can control and avoid trying to control things that are outside of your control.

, If the work you do and the people you do it with leave you feeling lackluster, you could be in the wrong career. If you have to change the way you act, undermine your values, or fantasize about leaving your job each day, pay attention to these cues.The culture of your workplace is just as important to your satisfaction as the actual position and salary. It may be time to quit. Re-examine why you got onto this career path or took this job."

, There are a variety of industries that you can work in as a customer service representative. Some of the most popular industries include banking, finance, retail, and technology.Think of the environment you want to work in. Determine if you'd like to work with customers in-person, over the phone, or online by considering your best personality traits. For instance, if you're likable and approachable, working in retail may be your best move. If you've got a great phone demeanor, then working in a call center may be your best option.


Many customer service representative jobs offer training, but it helps if you already have some knowledge of the industry you are looking to work in.
Customer service in the technical industry is one of the most profitable sectors you can get into., Customer service representative jobs can vary in pay significantly depending on your industry. The average customer service representative makes $34,560 a year. Consider the benefits that the company is providing and whether or not other people in your house rely on you. Choose a job that can fulfill the financial need in your life.

Take your time when filling out the application and make sure there are no typos in your resume.
Apply to more than one job and make sure always to provide the proper contact information.
Many customer service jobs will require a minimum of a resume and cover letter.
Experience increases the likelihood of getting the job.

, Once the company you apply to gets your resume, they will evaluate it and give you a call back if you have the skills or experience they are looking for. Make sure to keep your cellphone accessible and return the call as soon as possible if you missed it. Usually, during the callback they will ask short and general questions, then try to schedule a time for an interview. Make sure that you articulate your words clearly and keep an upbeat and positive attitude.


Be available for the interview and try your hardest not to reschedule, as it could hurt your chances of landing the job.
Be polite and energetic to the person who is calling you. It may be your future boss.

, To increase the chances of you getting the job, it's a good idea to review commonly asked questions for customer service interviews. Rehearse in front of a friend, family member, or in the mirror. Think of your answers ahead of time and be prepared to articulate answers as effectively as you can. Try to cater your answers towards what the interviewer would want to hear.


For example, if they ask you ""How would you handle a rude customer?"" the appropriate response could be something like, ""I would try to reassure them and calm the customer down. Then I would resolve their problem to the best of my ability, before sending them on their way.""
Other interview questions could include, ""Why would you be a good fit for our company as a customer service rep?"" ""Tell me about a time that you helped resolve a particularly difficult customer issue."" or ""Do you consider yourself a team player?"", Employers want customer service representatives that look put together and clean. If you are going for a retail job, they'll also want to see that you have a keen sense of fashion. Determine what kind of job you are going for and dress the part. If it's a corporate or office job, wear a suit and tie with slacks, or a dark blouse with black pants.Always go conservative if you're unsure of how to dress for the interview.
Avoid wearing loud colors.
Shower and brush your teeth before going to the interview.

, Once you apply and get a call-back, it's likely that the employer will call you in for an interview. This can happen at their corporate office, in-store, or at a call center.

, Once you get the job, make sure to read the employee handbook and listen to others while they train you. While many customer service skills can translate from one job to another, the operations at different companies can sometimes be vastly different. When you first start working as a customer service representative, there will probably be a lot to take in at first. Concentrate on nailing the basic operations before going into more complex things. For example, if working in retail, you may want to learn how to tag products and the companies policies before you start working on more complex tasks like inventory management.


Keep good working habits and stay organized so that you can learn as much as possible and secure promotions in the future.
The hiring manager wants to see that you're personable, can resolve problems, and have the right demeanor to interact with customers.
Good work habits include coming into work on time and working well with your colleagues.

Know your product or service inside and out.,
Learn the procedures and operations at your job.,
Maintain clear communication.,
Be polite and courteous.,
Have patience and be understanding.",How to Work As a Customer Service Representative2," The more you know about the product or service, the easier it will be to answer customer questions.Study the product or service that your company provides, and take note of frequently asked questions or common points of confusion. Knowing the product will make your job easier and you'll be more efficient.


You can even use or purchase the product or service to understand how the customer feels.
If you have questions about the product or service, ask your supervisor.
For example, if you're a customer service representative for a cable company, it would help to know what channels your company provides as well as common issues with cable boxes or modems.

, While customer service jobs require the same traits to be effective, each company and industry will have different standards and procedures. Even if you have some experience, learn the methods that your company uses. This could include a system to handle angry customers or the procedure to log individual calls into a database. Work closely with whoever is training you, and make sure to ask questions when you're unsure of something.


It's usually better to take your time and get something right, rather than rushing and messing it up.
Follow the instructions from the person training you carefully.

, A misunderstanding or miscommunication can damage your reputation with a customer. Keep the conversation clear and concise and don't talk about something unless you are certain about it. Identify their problem and work to solve their issue without diverting into a different topic.


If a customer asks you a question that you're not sure about, say, ""I'm not sure why, but let me put you on hold and I'll get the information from my supervisor. Sorry for the inconvenience.""
A miscommunication may make a customer have false expectations which could get you in trouble.For instance, if a customer asks how much something costs and you say ""It will be included in your bill,"" it could be misconstrued as a free product, when what you actually meant to say was, ""The cost will be listed on your bill.""

, When you're dealing with a customer, they will most likely mirror your attitude. If you act irate or annoyed, there's a good chance that they will return the favor and the interaction will be less than favorable. If you remain polite and courteous, even in the face of someone who's angry, your energy will affect the way they act.Try to set the tone for the interaction. If the customer is initially angry, you can reduce their frustration by staying calm and polite.
If you're dealing with an angry customer, you can say something like, ""I understand why you're angry, but I'm going to figure it out and resolve the issue.""

Be natural.,
Donât stare.,
Remember to smile.",How to Use Eye Contact Effectively in Sales," If you try, you can think back to a time when you had an in-person conversation with someone who made you uncomfortable. It might have been something as simple as a gaze that was too intense, or perhaps they were standing too close to you. More than likely, you wanted to get out of that conversation as quickly as possible, and had no desire to engage in conversation with them again. What was missing in their communication and body language was a sense of being calm, relaxed and natural.;
, Remember, eye contact is a natural occurrence between two people who are engaged in conversation. Making eye contact does not mean staring at the other person. It is natural to make eye contact sporadically, as opposed to looking into your prospectâs eyes throughout the entire encounter.

, Unless itâs a serious or dramatic part of your conversation, you should smile while making eye contact. A natural smile will help you to keep your eye contact authentic and appropriate.

Give something for free.,

Use the principle of scarcity.,
Use the principle of social validation.,
Be likable.,
Be an expert.,
Be authentic.,
Stay positive.,
Ask for referrals.,
Ask for testimonials.,
Offer incentives.",How to Use Psychology to Close More Sales," The principle of reciprocation is a psychological phenomenon described by Dr. Robert Cialdini, an expert in persuasion. According to this theory, it is part of human nature to feel obligated to repay debts of all kinds, big and small.If someone receives something free, they will feel a psychological urge to purchase a product to pay you back for your kindness. Offer a free trial period, a sample, or even a pleasant experience.The free item doesn't even have to be related to the product you are selling; you can send a client free personalized address labels, for example.You can even offer something simple like a beautiful handwritten note.;
, Psychologically speaking, we determine whether something is a deal by mentally comparing it to other things. One way we do this is by using the ""anchoring principle,"" which means that have an expectation of how much something should cost (that's the anchor) and we compare other items' prices to that expectation. This can make something seem like a good deal even if it isn't.This might seem complicated, but in practice, it's really rather simple:


Early on in your sales pitch, mention the suggested retail price of the product or of similar products. This becomes the ""anchoring"" price-point. Then, if the client doesn't bite, offer a discounted price. For example, you might say, ""These windows typically sell for $500 apiece. If you purchase two today, I will give you a third for free. That's like getting each window for only $333."" Suddenly the high price of one window doesn't seem so bad.

, Humans are programmed to stock up on whatever necessities we can so that we don't run out in times of famine. You can use this tendency to your own benefit by making your product seem scarce or in high demand.Offer a sale or promotion ""for a limited time"" or ""until supplies run out."" You can also say ""Today is the last day this product will be available for this price."", Your clients want to do things that are ""on trend"" and otherwise socially acceptable. In fact, they are more likely to purchase a product or service if they think that a lot of other people, especially people similar to them, have done the same thing.You can talk about ""your best selling product,"" or one that ""is really popular with"" a certain kind of person like your client (for example, busy moms, teachers, single men, etc.). This convinces would-be clients that your product is a popular one.
You can also try to increase your sales by getting other people to do your marketing for you. For example, if your business has a Facebook page, offer a prize for the person who refers the most friends by sharing a post on their Facebook wall. When people share about a product on Facebook, their friends see it as a personal recommendation which gives your product more validity in their eyes., Research has shown that the more someone likes you, the more likely they are to be persuaded by you.Likability has several elements that you can keep in mind:


Similarity: Human beings are pretty self-absorbed, and psychological research has found that people tend to like other people who seem most like themselves. You can emphasize things you have in common with your potential client (perhaps you both have kids, maybe you both love golf, or perhaps you grew up in the same hometown). You can also subtly mirror the body language of the potential client, which research has found can effectively cause the person to feel that you are similar to them.Attractiveness: Whether it's fair or not, it's true that people tend to be most easily persuaded by attractive people.Do your best to present a clean, neat, professional, and attractive appearance when you're with clients.
Humorous: People tend to like people who are funny, so using jokes can help you in closing sales. However, you have to be careful about using humor to persuade others; off-color jokes or offensive humor, forced humor, too much sarcasm, or dry humor that is hard to discern can have the opposite effect and push people away. Try to use just a bit of humor (if you're naturally funny) in your sales pitch. Self-effacing humor, as long as it is done sparingly, can be particularly effective, as some people find it endearing., No one will buy your product if you can't answer their questions about it, so not only do you need to know everything about your product, you also need to be able to communicate about it in a matter-of-fact way that communicates that you are an expert who can be trusted.Learn about the product, including its history, manufacturing process, the company that makes it, its ingredients, any ethical issues around its manufacturing or sales, how long it lasts, etc.
Learn about the competition. What products are similar, and what are their shortcomings? What makes your product the best to buy?
If a potential client asks a question that you can't answer, be honest. Don't try to make up information or cover for yourself. You will appear more trustworthy with a simple explanation like, ""I'm not sure about that, but I'm happy to find out and get back to you."" Then follow up as soon as possible.

, In a nutshell, authenticity can be defined as âundisputed credibility,â that appealing characteristic that truly honest people of integrity possess. Authenticity allows you to speak the truth, not from self-righteousness, rudeness, or ego but from truly intending to improve the situation for everyone concerned.


When it comes to sales, authenticity means that you should believe in the product that you're pushing, and actually believe it will help the client to purchase it., This is getting the prospect speaking about what they like about a particular product or service, and why they like it. This helps you to frame your pitch in such a way that it hits the key points and features that the customer is most interested in.


While it may seem obvious not to belabor any negative aspects of what youâre selling, itâs worth mentioning that itâs never appropriate to badmouth another company or their product or service.

, Contact your existing clients and ask if they would be willing to refer some friends or colleagues to you. Itâs completely up to you (or perhaps, your company) whether you offer any kind of incentive or reward for such referrals.


Individuals are more likely to make a purchase if they have been referred by someone they know and trust., You can use testimonials from actual customers on your website, Facebook, flyers, or other promotional materials. This increases the social capital behind the product, so that new clients will believe that lots of people have tried the product and like it.Start with family and friends. If your business is new, you may not have a lot of former clients to ask for referrals. Ask trustworthy friends or family to write an honest testimonial or review. You can also give away free products in exchange for honest reviews.
Rather than directly asking your existing clients for a testimonial, just ask them what they like most about the product or service, or have them explain why they love using it. Once theyâve explained, ask if they would be willing to allow you to share their comments with other potential clients. You can even offer to keep their names confidential (for example, list the statement as made by âMarcus P.â as opposed to âMarcus Petersonâ).
Attaching a smiling, flattering picture of the client to the testimonial is a great way to increase the testimonial's credibility. Ask the person giving the testimonial if they are comfortable with that.

, Everyone likes to get something for free, so offer a discount, product with purchase, or another incentive to potential clients for their business.You can also offer an incentive for customers who refer new clients.Just be sure to draft out the limits of the offer in case it goes viral online. For example, you might want to offer a free product to existing clients who refer new clients. But your offer might circulate in social media without your knowledge and result in thousands of requests for free products. Instead, you can specify in the original offer that you will provide free products to the first 100 clients who refer a new client, or however many you can accommodate.

Your customer will state their questions and concerns at the beginning of the call.

, If you aren't sure about a question a customer has, place them on hold and ask your supervisor. Guessing will cause you to become stressed out and will confuse you. You want to sound confident over the phone, this will allow the customer to trust you.

, Doing this will ensure that you can execute all of the customers questions efficiently. Irate customers will jump from subject to subject because they're angry. Focus on one subject at a time, don't allow a customer to confuse you, remember, you are the support.

However, keep in mind that too much control may result in bad feedback. you don't want to raise the tone of your voice when the customer does. Remaining calm at all times will help de escalate an argument.

, These words can sound unprofessional and make you sound confused.

, This may sound absurd, but the majority of the time, the customer is disappointed about something they are responsible for. Showing too much empathy will allow your customer to want more and gain control.

, Every customer service agent has heard this before. It's a very important rule to go by, but it may not be that easy. When you're dealing with irate customers, that negative energy can follow you on to the next call.Â Take a deep breath, have a drink of water, or even stand up and stretch. Staying seated all day can be harmful on the body, especially when hypertension in the body is high. Holding in all of that stress can make your day worse. Stress can have harmful effects on your cognitive functioning. It can cause you to become mentally drained and worn out, don't allow this to happen. Learn to smile and laugh, a great sense of humor goes far.

, Bringing the stress home with you will cause you to start the next day unmotivated. It's just a job, your happiness depends on the way you perceive things. So don't carry on extra baggage.

, Learning from your mistakes will help you avoid errors or inaccuracies in the future. It'll also help you become more proficient and diligent when handling business with others. Â Working in customer service may be difficult but it'll teach you to have patients and respect. Learning how to negotiate and come to terms with another person is something we all should be good at. Take your experience and use it to your advantage.

Ask a friend to join you.,
Do your errands.,
Be weird!,

Be positive.",How to Enjoy Your Run/Walk," Scientists have proved that when you are listening to music while doing some form of physical exercise, you tend to move to the beat of the song. Choose a song to suit your mood and what you are doing, because you don't want to listen to some slow dance song while you are running. The best songs are those with a very upbeat rhythm.;
, You'll have much more fun, and you might even have a race which will be fun and make you more active. You could also have deep intense conversations and because exercising releases endorphins (something that makes you happy), you won't feel sad while talking about something bothering you.

, You may think, how is this fun? But at least you'll have that pressure off your back and you can relax when you finish exercising and go home.

, Just shout out random stuff or start doing a weird dance while running-if you are alone you'll have tons of giggles, and if you just pass somebody doing something random you'll love the confused look that they'll have on their face. If you are with a friend and you do this you both will laugh your heads off!

, This may seem 'immature', but if done sparingly, it can be done without getting in trouble and without killing the joke. An appropriate prank could be that prank when you knock on somebodies door and then run away before they can answer the door.

, You can't exercise when you are acting like Negative Nelly.

Awaken the child in you and do not always run in a straight line.,
Run in place.,
Add some plyometrics into your routine.,

Uneven. With uneven surfaces, look at the ground or you could get hurt.;
,


Move backwards. Since running backwards is awkward, try this agility drill: run forward and backward in the same line several times. You can do this is a yard or basement without worrying about tripping and falling. Imagine, you were in a basement hallway, you would run forward and backward, many times and have no side movement.
Move sidewards. Move sidewards in a crab-like fashion without crossing your legs. This movement is tiring. Do a sidewards ladder movement, see YouTube and choose one that you would enjoy.

, Or do wind sprints or some kind of speed work. The complete package for an athlete is speed, strength, flexibility, endurance and agility. This articles fills in the gap of speed and agility, but not at a high level and just for short durations. The serious workouts are for professional and elite athletes, keep your energy for work

, For runners, who do a lot of walking in their jobs, develop a short program of say 10 minutes a week.

, Keep the cycling program very minimal also. With the cycle, you can track the rpm a very useful measure component that you can apply to running. Speed is stride length and strides per minute.

, Include the date, what you did, how much you did, where you did it and comments.

, The last thing you want is a heavy walking shoe.

, Be sure your foot has enough room in the toe box. There should be a thumbnails width (or about a half inch) between your toes and the end of the shoe. The shoe should be wide enough in the toe that your toes can move freely. Your heel should not slip, and the shoe should not pinch or bind, especially across the arch or ball of your foot.

, Also be sure to wear the same socks you will be wearing during your walks. This can make a huge difference in how the shoe fits. Try on both shoes. Your feet may not be the same size (really!).

Get to know the city It is quite useless to try to enjoy a city you are not familiar with.,
Identify and use the areas you liked: By this time you ought to have a good idea of the city's network.,
Use your iPod/mp3 player/CD player: If you do not have one, consider getting one.,
Imagine your walk as a movie scene: While walking, imagine yourself as the person you want to be, not necessarily the person you are.,
Notice the small things: Keep an eye out for the little unique things that give each city its charm.,
Incorporate your surroundings: Look at what is around you, the things that annoy you and the things that amuse you, and take it all in.,
Don't focus on your destination: You know where you are going.,
Be patriotic: This may seem like an odd sort of step, but it works.,
Take more voluntary walks: Start walking for the fun of it and not just to get from point A to point B.",How to Enjoy Walking in the City," A lot of sidewalk frustration occurs when you miscalculated the distance between where you are and your destination, or you lost your way and ended up halfway across the area in the wrong direction.


Over the weekend, or during a day off, get up early in the morning, take a map and just walk. Walk wherever you feel like going. It doesn't matter how long it takes or where you are going, just keep walking.
While you do this, pay attention to where you are going. You don't need to focus on your environment too much, just make sure you can remember how you got there and any important things you can note about your environment (For example, your environment may have a Used Books Store, a billboard advertising tea...etc). If you have to, write these down.
Be open to the experience. Let all your fears and doubts go, remind yourself that you're just getting to know the city. When you are hungry you will find somewhere to eat, when you need to go back home you will be able to get a taxi and tell the driver the address and get home.
While walking, identify the 'good' and 'bad' areas. You will come across some areas you feel uncomfortable in and make a note of the route. These will be your 'red spots'. The places you are going to try to not end up when you walk.
Spend the whole day exploring the city and when it starts to turn dark, hail a cab and get back home.;
, You might have found a small secluded area near a busy street, a vendor with the most amazing finger food or an interesting park. Note these areas down and work out a general route in your mind which would allow you to come across more of the good areas and less of the red spots. If you have a set route you take to get to work, change it to include some of these areas, you ought to have found at least one spot during your expedition that can be integrated into your schedule. Even if you didn't, consider the expedition a practice round for enjoying a city walk.

, You can put on your favourite music on it and use it while walking to tune out the city noise and to perk up your day. Try to create a playlist specifically for your walk and fill it with 'guilty pleasure' songs (songs that you secretly love, but would never admit it to anyone) and instrumentals with a good beat. This is going to be the 'soundtrack' to your walk.

, For example you can imagine yourself more tall, more confident, with a different hair colour, with a different job or destination. Pretend that this is the person you actually are. This will give you a sense of greater purpose and will give you an incentive to actually play the part. This will usually result in you being more tolerant of the people around you and you will look a lot more confident, thus people will be more tolerant with you. If you want to be the French Ambassador to the UN, go ahead. How would those other people on the street know anyway? And if you can pull it off, they might believe you could be someone that important.

, There could be a robin perched on a mailbox, a streetlamp that looks just like an antique, a child playing with a balloon, a street vendor that can't speak English. There are many things like these that make a city more than just a dwelling of skyscrapers and people. Figure out what gives the city its personality.

, Integrate it into the 'script' that is your life. Previously you imagined your life as a movie scene, but those things into the script. If a vendor just dumped a pile of dead fish near you, wrinkle your nose and imagine yourself looking at the scene from the outside, see yourself and continue on, instead of gagging and grumbling about it all the way to work. There will be annoyances during your walk, almost 90% of them will be minor and petty. Stop giving importance to those petty things by dwelling on them. They are not worth it. Accept what happens and move on. If you can't do this for the small stuff, how will you handle it for something more important?

, You know how long it's going to take. You know how to get there. If you do not know these things, please pay attention to your path and ignore this step. The destination is not going to change drastically and you know the way. Relax and focus on the walk. Do not think about what you're going to do once you get to your destination, do not stress about the workload waiting for you. It's waited all night, it can wait a few minutes. Look around, pay attention to your belongings and concentrate on the fact that you are walking through the city. Sing along (quietly) to the music you are listening to.

, Do not imagine your city to just be a hamlet. Devote yourself to it. It is your city. You live in it or are currently living in it. You owe something to it and it owes something to you. Keep that feeling.

, Go out at a time when no one is around and just walk around the block. If you're at home and you're feeling stressed, grab your coat and walk outside to see the sunset. Start to enjoy the experience of walking, this will extend the joy of walking in the city.

Take one to two rest days each week.",How to Choose Between Walking and Running for Your Workout," Since running is a higher intensity exercise and can be harder on your joints, itâs important to talk to your doctor first. She or he can help you decide whether or not running is appropriate for you.


Although running is generally considered a great form of cardiovascular exercise, it might not be appropriate for all people.
If you have arthritis, a degenerative joint disease or a chronic cardiac problem, running might not be something your physician wants to you do on a regular basis.
Talk to your doctor about your choice of whether to run or walk as exercise. Ask him or her if there is anything you should consider when making your decision. Or ask your physician if he or she thinks walking or running would be more appropriate for you.;
, If you want to improve your overall endurance and aerobic capability, you might want to consider choosing to go for a run over walking. Moderate to high intensity cardio activities help improve your endurance more dramatically than walking.When you do cardiovascular exercise, your body pumps more blood through your heart to help deliver oxygen-rich blood to your muscles and lungs. Over time, your heart adjusts to this larger volume of blood and is able to pump more blood out per beat.
Your heart becomes very efficient at pumping blood and your heart rate will eventually slow down as your heart's endurance improves over time.
If you want to improve your endurance and stamina (for example, doing any type of aerobic exercise at a faster pace or longer time) consider running over walking. It'll help your heart become more efficient and better able to push you through difficult cardio routines.

, Another reason you may be considering going for a run is that you want to up your calorie burn during exercise. If this is the case, you might want to choose running.


It's commonly believed that running a mile and walking a mile ends up burning the same amount of calories. Although the amounts are close, running does in fact burn more calories.When you're running, your body has to expend more energy to propel your body forward and then absorb the shock of your legs and feet hitting the ground. Walking does not require the same amount of energy.
So if burning more calories is your goal, go for a run. But don't forget about the total time you spend running. You still want to aim for a decent amount of time per run. Plan to run for at least 20 to 30 minutes and do not only use distance as a measure.

, Running does burn more calories than walking. But that's not the only reason that running seems to be the better choice when it comes to weight loss.


If weight loss is your goal, running may be able to aid your efforts. For starters, it burns more calories per mile. The more calories you burn during exercise, could mean quicker weight loss.
In addition, many studies have shown that in comparison, runners are typically thinner and have an easier time maintaining a lower body weight compared to those who only walk.Also, studies have shown that running helps suppress appetite more than walking, which may help you decrease your total calorie consumption during the day.

, Another reason you may want to choose to go for a run over a walk, is if you have an overly busy schedule.


If you have a long commute, long work hours, are juggling work and school or have a busy family life, you may not have a lot of time to dedicate to a workout every day.
You can torch calories more quickly by fitting in a quick two mile run. Walking two miles will most likely take twice as long as doing a quick two mile run.
Even if you have 20 minutes, you can fit in a quick run. You will burn more calories in that 20 minutes, compared to walking during that 20 minutes.

, One very common reason that people choose to walk is if they have bad joints. Whether you have arthritis or just feel more stiff, going for a walk may be better than going for a run.


Walking is considered a low intensity and low impact exercise. This makes it perfect for those with bad joints or chronic joint pain.Studies have shown that walking on a regular basis can actually help relieve and reduce pain in your joints over time.
If you have chronic joint pain - especially in your hips, knees or feet - consider choosing to go for a walk. It'll be a lot easier and less painful compared for running.

, Another great reason to choose walking instead of running is if you need a break from exercise. Everyone needs a rest day and you can go for a walk on these days.


If you typically participate in moderate to high intensity aerobic activities during the week, you'll need to take some time off in between to allow your body to relax and recover.
Studies have shown that your overall performance (including endurance and strength) increases with regular rest days.Instead of being totally inactive on your rest days, you can safely do a leisurely walk. This helps you stay active, but doesn't stress your body the same as other activities like running.

, If you've injured yourself, you probably will be limited on what type and amount of activity you can do. However, depending on your injury you may still be able to walk for exercise.


If you've injured yourself - like pulling a hamstring or straining your lower back - you might be restricted on the type and amount of activity you can do.For example, if you've injured your back, running is not recommended. The pounding on the pavement can exacerbate symptoms.
Walking is a more appropriate exercise since itâs a low impact exercise. It allows you to stay active even if you've got some mild injuries.
If you're not feeling all that well, but still want to be active, a short walk is OK while doing a run may expend too much energy.

, A less common reason you may need to choose walking is if you have certain health conditions or issues. Higher intensity exercise is not appropriate for everyone.


If you have uncontrolled or difficult to control asthma, increasing your heart rate and breathing level may not be safe for you.
It may also be recommended that you avoid running if you're pregnant. Many OB/GYNs recommend keeping your heart rate at a low to moderate level which you can't do easily while running.If you aren't sure if running is safe for you, walk until you get clearance from a physician to run.

, A very simple reason to choose walking over running is if you like it better. It's better to walk more regularly than run just occasionally.


Since running does burn more calories than walking and may be better for weight loss, many people think that running, in general, is better for you than walking.
However, the best exercise for you is the one you actually enjoy the best and are most likely going to be consistent with over time.
If you truly don't enjoy running or find it difficult to stay consistent, go for a walk instead.

, If you're able to run and walk without any issues, consider doing a combination of both types of exercises. Sometimes a combination is the best choice.


One benefit of including both running and walking during the week is that you can get some of the cardiovascular benefits of running but allow your body to rest with walking.
Also, doing a variety of cardiovascular exercises during the week gives different muscle groups and joints time off. You're not risking overuse injuries by stressing the same areas of the body each day.

, Regardless of whether you choose to run or to walk, it's important to meet the minimum weekly guidelines for aerobic activity.


Health professionals recommend that you include at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity each week.Aim for moderate intensity activities in addition to doing each activity for at least 10 minutes at a time.
In addition to running and walking you can do a spin class, dance class, or go hiking as aerobic activity.

, Similar to cardiovascular activity, you also need to include the recommended amount of strength training each week.


In addition to 150 minutes of cardiovascular activity, you also need to include one to two days of strength training each week.When you're doing strength training exercises, aim to work out for at least 20 minutes per session and work every major muscle group in your body.
Exercises you can try include: lifting free weights, pilates, yoga or body weight exercises.

, Whether you choose to walk on your rest days, itâs still important to regularly schedule in one to two rest days each week.


Rest days are equally important to your overall fitness performance as regular cardio and strength training.
It's during rest and recovery that your muscles increase in size, strength and your endurance improves.
In general, most people need about one to two days of rest each week. You can choose to do a leisurely walk, do restorative yoga or go for a bike ride on your rest days.

Watch where you walk.,
Notice your surroundings.,
Move close to the ground.,
Walk heel to toe.,
Keep your arms close.,
Transfer most of your weight and pressure away from your feet.",How to Walk Silently1," Moving soundlessly is much more difficult when you're walking on crunchy gravel and leaves than it is when you're moving over soft grass or dirt. To walk silently, assess the terrain and determine which path is the quietest. Whether you're indoors or outdoors, you can consciously walk over materials that help you move silently instead of creating extra noise.


If you're walking through the woods or in another outdoor area, try to walk on soft grass or dirt. Walk on wet leaves instead of dry, crunchy ones.
When walking outdoors, look for rocks or roots, as they won't crunch like leaves or twigs. Slowly put your weight onto the rock or root to be sure it won't shift or make noise. Once you are certain, put the rest of your weight down.
In a city setting, avoid wooden walkways, graveled areas, cobblestones, and other materials that tend to make noise.
Indoors, walk on carpeting whenever possible.
When climbing items trees and cliffs, be mindful of where your foot lands. Try to place your toes and the front padding of the foot in between branches and on crevices of the cliff. If you are forced to step in the middle of a branch or push up the side of the cliff, do it slowly and proceed with caution. A little force may dislodge a shower of debris or break a twig alerting watchers.;
, The space you move through is as likely to create sound as the path under your feet. When you want to walk silently, it's important to stay very aware of your surroundings so that you avoid touching anything that could give you away.


Avoid twigs and branches that could snag on your clothes and snap.
Avoid gates and fences that could squeak or creak.
Avoid brushing against piles of clutter and rustling fabrics.

, Walk in a slightly crouched position, engaging all of your muscles as you move. This lightens the amount of force that hits the ground each time you make contact, enabling you to move much more quietly. Keep your body compact, and distribute your weight evenly so you don't clunk your feet noisily against the ground.

, Place the heel of your foot down first and roll your foot slowly and gently toward your toes onto the ground. As you walk, rotate your hips slightly to make your steps even more controlled. Walk on the outer edge of your shoes if possible.


If you need to move swiftly, keep low to the ground and run using the same heel-to-toe strike.
When you're moving backwards, place the ball of your foot on the ground first, then lower your heel to the ground.
Running on the balls of one's feet can help with speed and quietness, but be careful; this requires more strength in the feet and lower legs, and greater flexibility in the ankle and foot joints. It also requires a better balance than normal movement, and creates a greater impression on softer surfaces (due to the weight being spread over a decreased surface area).
Land softly. Running or jumping silently is difficult, but it's possible if you master the art of landing quietly. Land in a crouched, balanced position without striking the ground too hard.

, Try not to use your hands and arms by balancing yourself on walls and such, because you could knock something over and give away your presence. Instead, hold them out in a position that makes you feel comfortable and balanced.

, Of course, you can't transfer all of your weight and pressure. Although it can't be demonstrated, theoretically, it could be described as feeling empty feet (but not numb) and feeling a pressurized head. Transferring your weight and pressure to your head might make you self-conscious of your surroundings, building up alertness. This is useful for multiple things, but primarily jumping. If there is a thick spread of dry leaves, you would need to jump. When jumping, aim for a clear spot that is not wet (e.g. puddle) and not covered with dry foliage (e.g. dry leaves or grass). Land with your toes and the front of your feet. Wearing sneakers work best as the rubber will smooth out the noise."

Wear soft footwear.,
Be sure your footwear fits snugly.,
Wear sparse, tight clothing.",How to Walk Silently2," The harder your footwear, the louder the noise. The best type of footwear is socks or leather moccasins, but form-fitting boots or sneakers also work well. Avoid hard-soled boots, shoes with heels or tough soles, and shoes that are difficult to walk in. Comfortable, soft shoes are the way to go.


Sweaty socks can make noise when you walk. If you sweat too much in your socks, wear a double pair of socks to mask the sound.
Walking in bare feet can be the quietest way to move, but it can also be the loudest - if you step on a sharp object and exclaim in pain, giving yourself away. Plus, if your feet are sweaty, they might stick to the coating on the floor and make a ""stripping"" sound. It is possible to avoid making this sound by decreasing contact with the floor and walking on the outside edges of the balls of your feet, but be careful, as this requires greater strength and balance. Decide whether going barefoot is the wisest choice for the environment you're moving through.
Make sure your footwear is completely dry; not only can it squeak, but damp spots on the floor can alert someone to your presence. When these damp footprints dry, they can leave obvious ""clean prints"" in the shape of your shoes, especially on surfaces like concrete.

, If your foot slides at all in your footwear, it can produce a squeaking noise, especially if your feet are sweaty. If you are wearing shoes with shoelaces, tuck the laces into your shoe. If you don't, they may click against the shoe or the floor as you walk.

, Loose pants can rub against your legs when you're walking, making a rustling sound. Wearing tight pants can minimize this possibility. Wearing very soft clothing, light cotton sweatpants, will also keep noise to a minimum.


Tuck your shirt into your pants, and tuck your pant legs into your shoes or socks. This will prevent them from flapping around.
Shorts are more prone to moving around and making noise than pants, and you can't tuck shorts into your socks. If you must wear shorts, try tying a piece of string or elastic around them at your knees, but not so tightly that you will cut off circulation.

"
"
Prepare your body.,
Breathe steadily.,
Match the cadence of another's gait.,
Blend with your surroundings.,
Be still when necessary.",How to Walk Silently3," If you have time to prepare before you're in a situation in which you need to walk quietly, taking small measures can help you make fewer sounds when you walk. For example,


Stretch before you try to move silently. It is common that your joints and bones will click when you first exert them, so stretching before you're in the thick of the moment is a good idea. Stretching will make you feel looser and stop anything clicking and giving away your presence.
Don't go on an empty stomach, but don't have a huge feast either. Your body actually gets heavier after you eat, and therefore, louder.
Go to the bathroom before you attempt walking silently.

, You might be tempted to hold your breath, but it's better to take slow and measured breaths from the nose. That way, you won't risk inhaling or exhaling too loudly when you need air. If you're congested, open your mouth wide and take deep, controlled breaths.


You may feel your breath quicken as adrenaline moves through your body. If that happens, pause, catch your breath, and take a few deep, calming breaths to ease your anxiety. Make sure you're breathing normally again before you continue.

, If you're following someone, you can hide the sound of your steps by walking in time with him or her. As the person steps with his or her left foot, you use your left foot, and repeat with the right foot. This will help mask any noise your feet may make.


Be careful not to get carried away when you're matching someone's gait - it's still important to use the proper technique for walking silently. Otherwise, if the person stops abruptly and you keep walking, you'll be caught.

, If you are moving through a wooded area where dry twigs, brush, dense jungle or leaves will make absolute silence impossible, move in small, erratic increments and pause: don't move in a steady plodding, marching, pounding rhythm.


Mimic the sounds around you. For example, a forest might be filled with the sound of small animals foraging. They typically move a short distance, pause to sniff for food or predators, and continue to move a short distance.
Capitalize on any other sources of noise (gusts of wind, other animal movement, passing traffic) to suppress or camouflage sound.

, If your aim is to have the ability to move through terrain without making a sound, sometimes you'll see the need to be still. Stand still and observe your surroundings before moving forward. Take as much time as you need to notice the objects around you that could trip you up and give you away.


If you're following someone or trying not to be seen, there will be moments when you'll have to practice extreme patience. Be still and wait for the person to pass, or for the tension of the situation to dissipate, before moving forward.

Use clean, clear formatting that recruiters can easily scan.,
Proofread, proofread, and proofread some more.",How to Write a Resume for a Real Estate Job," Traditionally, resumes have included an ""objective"" detailing your hopes for your job search. Today, recruiters recommend providing a professional profile or ""career summary"" instead. This profile will immediately follow your contact information on your resume. Your goal is to powerfully demonstrate that you are the one to meet your prospective employer's needs.Specifically state your licensing qualifications and experience.
Mention the type of real estate with which you're most experienced. This allows both you and recruiters to avoid poor ""fit"" -- if you're a skilled home seller, for example, you would be wasted in industrial property sales.
Add information about something you do exceptionally well, any additional complementary skills, and any impressive achievements or awards.
Use hard numbers to showcase your skills and achievements.A sample professional profile might begin, ""Licensed realtor with 12 years of residential sales experience at both local and national real estate firms."" Bullet points can then highlight that you are an expert in developing new business, increasing your last agency's client base by 18 percent in two years; highly skilled in conducting market research; and hold an Accredited Buyer's Designation from the National Association of Realtors.;
, Provide percentages, dollar figures, number of employees, and training classes to demonstrate the range and success of your past enterprises.


For example, you might state that you advised sellers on how to make their homes more appealing to potential buyers, increasing average selling prices by 15 percent over initial appraisal values.Avoid referring to yourself as a ""consultant"" unless you can quantify your consulting duties. Employers and recruiters are wary of vague job descriptions. If you do opt to use the term ""consultant,"" provide concrete specifics on how your consulting activities produced results: increased sales using specific numbers and percentages, or process improvements detailing before-and-after information and money saved. , Ensure your experience is presented as relevant to today's market, especially if you've been involved in the industry for some years.


That said, cite dates of employment for each position you list. Missing dates are a red flag to recruiters that there may be a gap in your employment history.

, Use a variety of action-oriented terminology to emphasis your energy and skills: accompany, advise, close, conduct, evaluate, examine, generate, interview, introduce, maintain, negotiate, prepare, promote, schedule, or sell., Computer skills are a must in this day and age; be specific about how you can use computer technology to positively impact an organization (social media successes, for example). Other in-demand skills in the real estate industry include negotiation and interpersonal communication skills, math skills, marketing knowledge, understanding of federal and local real estate laws, trustworthiness, customer service, flexibility, resourcefulness, and the ability to network. Provide an example whenever possible.You might, for example, list that you've established a Facebook page to post your firm's key listings, with highlighted properties receiving an average of 15 ""shares."" This demonstrates you know how to use social media to substantially increase the visibility of your listings.

, This lets your prospective employer know that you're up to date and involved in your industry.Include special training or continuing education classes when relevant. For example, if you are looking for a position with a condominium developer, noting your Homeowners Association training could be quite useful.

, Any resume-writer may opt to include GPA in the education section of his or her resume, but this is especially important advice for a recent graduate. This helps you demonstrate your aptitude as a student and show that you took your education seriously.


If your cumulative GPA is less than 3.0, consider calculating and including your major GPA. Only do so, however, if it works out to an average above 3.0., Describe your accomplishments using industry-specific terms. Quantify your accomplishments where relevant.For example, you might mention that in your service as advertising manager for the student newspaper, you increased ad sales by 23 percent and successfully ""negotiated"" higher advertising rates for full-page ads.

, You'll show recruiters you did more at university than simply attend classes -- an important demonstration of enthusiasm in an industry that thrives on networking. Again, use industry language and provide numbers where possible.


Note that recruiters rank teamwork and communication skills (both written and verbal) as their top-priority skills. Demonstrate your aptitude in these areas, but also pay close attention to the job description. It may reveal other soft skills that recruiters are seeking.For example, you might highlight your successful introduction of a dormitory Web site as resident assistant that increased participation in dorm activities by 32 percent.

, Like all resumes, your real estate resume should feature your name, address, phone numbers and email address on the top of the page.


Provide your license number, if you have one, and list the state(s) in which you are licensed.

, In addition to contact information, your resume should include a professional profile, experience, education, and additional skills and credentials. If you are a recent graduate, consider listing your education before your experience.

, Wide margins, clear 10- to 12-point type, clear headings, a logical format, wise use of bold and italic typefaces, and well-placed bullet points will help your information transmit clearly to readers. Real estate resumes should be fairly conservative; avoid using color or creative flourishes. Your priority is legibility.


Limit your resume to one page in length.
Refrain from including a photo on your resume. While these are often used by realtors on marketing tools, they are considered unprofessional on resumes.
Keep your resume focused on your professional qualifications; refrain from including personal activities and hobbies., Your resume needs to be grammatically perfect and free of typographical errors. Ask a friend or family member to read through your resume and point out errors -- sometimes it can become difficult to see them yourself after reviewing a document multiple times."

, Word-of-mouth advertising can be quite profitable for your business. Contact your friends and relatives and tell them about your real estate services.

",How to Probate an Estate in California," In some instances, decedentâs property passes outside of his or her probate estate. If all of the decedentâs assets pass outside the probate estate, there is no probate estate, and therefore, you do not need to involve the Courts in distributing the property. Property that passes outside the probate estate includes :


Community property. Community property passes, by law, to the surviving spouse or domestic partner. If all of the property of a married decedent, or a decedent in a registered domestic relationship is community property, you do not need to probate an estate. The surviving spouse or domestic partner may file a Spousal or Domestic Partner Property Petition in order to have the Court decide what his or her share of the community property is, and what part of the decedentâs property passes to him or her.
Jointly held property. Bank accounts, vehicles, real estate, and investments held jointly pass, by law, to the surviving joint owner.
Property with a named beneficiary. Personal property, such as investments, vehicles, or bank accounts with a named transfer on death (âTODâ) or pay on death (âPODâ) beneficiary passes, by law, to the beneficiaries upon the ownerâs death.;
, Add up the value of everything that does not pass outside of the probate estate. To do this:


Ascertain the date of death value of all furnishings and household goods that do not pass directly to a spouse or registered domestic partner.
Add up the date of death total for all checking, savings, retirement, and investment accounts, including certificates of deposit (âCDsâ), stocks, and bonds, that do not have a listed TOD or POD beneficiary or a joint owner.
Add up all life insurance policies that do not list a beneficiary and will be paid to the estate.
Exclude the value of cars, boats, mobile homes, property held in trust, real estate located outside of California, and any unpaid salary or other compensation up to $5,000 owed.
Total the value, without subtracting debts or mortgages.

, In California, there are three (3) choices for distributing probate property of a decedent.


By affidavit. If the probate estate totals $150,000 or less, and there is no real property located in California, you can transfer personal property by completing an affidavit, and do not need to probate the estate. Many banks and the Department of Motor Vehicles (âDMVâ) have affidavit forms available. You may also be able to find an affidavit form on your Courtâs website, in the self-help section.
By a simplified probate process. If the decedent left $150,000 or less, and that includes real property located in California, you will need to file Petition to Determine Succession to Real Property, an Inventory and Appraisal, and provide notice of hearing to all interested parties.
Through the regular probate process. If the decedent left $150,000 or more, you must go through the regular probate process. (Continue with the next step.)

, The California Court provides a form for the Petition for Probate on its website. Download the form by right clicking the link, and choosing âsave link asâ then browsing to the place on your hard drive where you wish to save the form, and clicking âsaveâ.

, There are basically two options for probate available in California:


Probate of Will and issuance of Letters Testamentary. If the decedent died leaving a Will, and you will not attach the Will to the Petition, you should choose Probate of Will and for Letters Testamentary. If the decedent died leaving a Will, and you plan to attach the Will to the Petition, you should chose Probate of Will and for Letters of Administration with Will annexed.
Issuance of Letters of Administration. If the decedent did not leave a Will, you should choose Letters of Administration.

, The PR will be in charge of collecting and distributing the estate assets, filing pleadings with the Court, and paying the debts of the decedent. If the decedent requested that a particular person act as his or her PR, that is who should be appointed. If he or she is unable to act, or no PR was requested by the decedent, the heirs should choose someone they trust to act as PR.

, You should file your probate documents in the county Court in the county where the decedent lived and/or owned real estate.

, Finishing filling in the Petition for Probate, following the instructions provided on the form. If you are unsure what a question is asking, a Court Clerk can assist you; however, clerks cannot give legal advice, and therefore can only provide a limited amount of assistance.

, You will need to file more than just the Petition for Probate. The best way to decide which forms are appropriate is to read each form, and see if it applies to your situation and circumstances. Probate forms can be located here, on the California Courtâs website. Some forms that most people will need to complete include:


Notice of Hearing. Form DE-120, Notice of Hearing should be filed along with the petition.
Notice of Petition to Administer Estate. Form DE-121, Notice of Petition to Administer Estate should be sent to each heir, interested party, and creditor of the decedent.
Duties and Liabilities of Personal Representative. Form DE-147, Duties and Liabilities of Representative, should be signed by the proposed Personal Representative and filed with the Court.
Letters. Form DE-150, Letters, will need to be completed and signed by the Personal Representative, in front of the Court Clerk.
Notice of Administration to Creditors. Form DE-157, Notice of Administration to Creditors, should be completed and mailed to each creditor of the decedent.
Order for Probate. Form DE-140, Order for Probate should be completed by anyone filing a petition for probate. Do not sign the Order. The signature line should be left blank, for the Judge to sign.

, If the PR does not receive his or her letters within two (2) week of filing the Petition and other pleadings, contact the Court.

, The estate will need an EIN in order to hold assets until they can be distributed. An EIN acts as a Social Security number for the estate, so that a bank account can be opened and the PR can collect the assets. To obtain an EIN, go to the Internal Revenue Serviceâs (âIRSâ), Employer ID Numbers page and follow the instructions to obtain your EIN online.

, The PR should go to a local bank or credit union and open an account for the Estate, using the estateâs EIN number. The name on the account should be âthe Estate of NAME OF DECEDENTâ.

, The PR should use his or her Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration at all financial institutions where the decedent has an account that is a part of the probate estate, in order to collect the funds in the account. Once collected, all funds should be deposited in the estate account.

, After all assets have been collected, the PR should complete and file an Inventory and Appraisal with the Court. If there is real estate located in California, it will need to be appraised by a Probate Referee. Locate a probate referee in the county where the property is located, by selecting that county from the Probate Referee Contact Information list provided by the California State Controllerâs Office.

, The PR should pay the bills and distribute the assets according to the Will or California Intestate Inheritance statues.

, The PR should complete an Ex Parte Petition and file it with the Court.

Initially send an email blast, customising the emails slightly, to each branch manager.,
Be patient but persistent.,
Get a vibe for the dealership and its management.,
Impress during your interviews.,
Be direct and ""sell"" yourself for the position.,
Follow up.",How to Start a Career in Car Sales," This is for your benefit and will help you with all of your interviews and potential positions.;
, Consider the pros and cons of each.


Look at the area you live in - Is it rural or urban? You don't want to work for a BMW dealership in a farming community or area. You don't want to be working for a Chevy dealership in an upscale and sophisticated area where image and prestige is everything. You're there to make money after all.
What brand are you passionate about? Do you know everything about Fords or Porsche's? This is very important as it will affect your enthusiasm. If your just in it for the money then you'll go for the best pay plan and potential like a truck dealership in a farming community or Japanese maker dealership like Toyota or Honda in a predominantly urban area or a German/European dealer in a high income area. Environment is very important.

, Make sure you get the following key points in:


You are looking to break into the car sales industry
Although you have no car sales experience you do have SALES experience and are a hard worker and will take on board any information he/she provides
You are available immediately.
You would like to come in for a chat with them.

, The chances are you won't get that many responses, branch sales managers are very busy and often have many applications the same as yours. To make yourself stand out you need to call - remember one of the key skills of a car salesperson is perseverance - show this quality by calling to speak with the branch manager - if you can't get through make sure you leave a message stating your name and that you are calling for work.

, Dealership management is very important. There are a lot of snakes out there and you will want to avoid them. Go in, in the morning and chat up one of the idle sales people and grill them about the working conditions and pay plans there and ask for advice. Chances are that they know a lot more than you about the various dealerships in the area. Do this again in the evening and chat up one of the evening shift sales advisors. You can do this as long as you feel comfortable.

, After this process with all of the showrooms in your area, you should eventually get an interview. Here are some Interview tips:


Make sure you are presentable, nothing but a suit will do here, make sure its ironed, your top button is done up, if a lady make sure if you are wearing a skirt that its not too low, knee length is preferable. (If a man make sure you are clean shaved)
Ask questions - questions are key in the sales process - demonstrate your questioning ability by asking questions in the interview, remember this is a 2 way thing and you need to determine car sales is right for you.
If any objections are thrown your way then make sure you handle them. As a salesman you will receive objections every day. A classic objection handling test by a sales manager will be "" I don't think you are suitable for this position"" make sure you ask WHY.
Another classic interview test is ""sell this pen"" the easiest way to do this is by simply asking ""What do you require a pen for"" obviously the answer will be for writing THEN ""well this pen is the best writing pen in the whole world, shall we go ahead with this sale then""
Make sure you start and finish the interview with a firm handshake.

, At the end of the interview, ask the question ""is the job mine?"" If no then, ""why?"" Always demonstrate objection handling skills.

, The interview process does not end when you leave the showroom, if you haven't heard anything by the second day, get on the phone and start the persistence again, this is demonstrating your desire to work and that you have this key skill of perseverance, you never know the sales manager may have had doubts, this could help seal the deal for you.

Apply widely.,
Keep trying.,
Stop by the stores where you would like to work.,
Be prepared for your interview.,
Familiarize yourself with the company.,
Show up on time and ready.",How to Work at a Jewelry Store," A high school diploma would be the minimum educational qualification. If you choose college knowing you want to go into the jewelry field, choose courses that allow you to become familiar with basic computer skills, computer-assisted drafting (CAD), business, and even gemology if they offer it., Working in a jewelry store requires a clean background check and no possible security risks on the part of the store.With the expensive items that are in a jewelry store, any issue with shoplifting, for example, would probably disqualify you., Even though you want to work in a jewelry store, it might not work out the first few times you apply. Gaining retail experience before applying again is a good idea. This will give you customer service skills that will be essential in working in a jewelry store.

, Informational interviews can be very revealing. Tell the person you want to talk to that you would love to buy them a coffee and ask about their job. Most people will be willing to talk to you. You will find out what people actually do and how they feel about their jobs. Think about doing interviews with people who work in a variety of different jewelry stores. The kinds of questions you might ask them are:What does a typical work day look like?
What do you wish you had known before you took the job?
What is the most challenging part of your job?
Do you have any recommendations or suggestions for me?

, This resume should reflect your education as well as your experience in sales and customer service. Make sure you have people who are familiar with your work that can be references. If youâve just graduated from high school and have no experience yet, think about how you can present the kinds of activities youâve done in school as potential parallels to your proposed work in a jewelry store.If you sold concessions at school events, thatâs retail experience.
If you were the treasurer for a club or activity group, you successfully budgeted and kept track of the groupâs money -- great experience for working in a store.
If you were part of a team or on the staff of a student publication, you might have helped order supplies. This could translate into experience ordering for the store.

, In the letter, explain why you want to work in jewelry and the steps you have taken to make yourself an attractive candidate. Explain your passion for jewelry, retail work, and any other relevant skills you may have for the position., It will depend on where you live, but there are typically job-focused sites like Indeed or Monster or others like craigslist that have multiple kinds of postings. Ask around the people with whom you have done informational interviews where their business typically posts openings. Watch for any open jobs., Even if you think you want to work in a small local business rather than a chain (or vice versa) itâs always good to apply to an array of positions. You never know what the experience of working at that particular job will be.

, Few people get the first job they apply for. Keep honing your retail and customer service skills as you wait for a jewelry store job., Talk to the people there and demonstrate your interest. Be upfront about your interest in a position.

, Now that youâre closer to getting the job you want, you need to make a good impression in your interview. Have professional clothing and a copy of your resume to take along. Get a good nightâs sleep, and always leave early so that you have plenty of time to get there., Do research online about the kinds of jewelry they specialize in and the people who work there. Formulate some questions to ask of the people that will be interviewing you.What do you like best about working at this jewelry store?
How do you see this position fitting with the rest of the team?
What are the most difficult parts of this position?

, Do your best in the interview -- show your interest and knowledge while learning more about the company and the position. Wait to hear from them about whether or not they will be hiring you.

After washing, iron your clothing to remove all wrinkles.,
Snip any loose threads from the clothing with scissors.

,
Close all snaps and zippers and button all buttons.

,
Fully inspect the clothing for stains, holes or rips.,
Put each piece of clothing on a plastic hanger with the hook of the hanger pointing to the left.,
Pin the clothing to 1 or both sides of the top of the hanger with safety pins.,
Make your tag on a piece of heavy cardstock according to the specification of the sale.,
Pin the tag to the upper right-hand side of the clothing item.,
Organize clothing by size, from smallest to largest.",How to Tag Clothing for Consignments Sales,";
,,, Most consignment sales will not accept damaged or stained clothing.

, If held up in front of you, the hook should look like the hook of a question mark.


If there is more than 1 piece to an outfit, place it on the backside of the first piece, facing outward so the front of both garments can be easily viewed by turning it over.

, Make sure the pin secures the item to the hanger so it won't fall off with excessive movement.


When hanging pants or shorts alone, pin the top of both sides of the pants to the top of the hanger.
If you're hanging 2 pieces on 1 hanger, secure them both to the top of the hanger with safety pins, making sure to pin through the both pieces. If you have 2 shirts, you can place them on 2 separate hangers and rubber band the hooks of the hangers together.

, Examples of this may be to hand write or print out the item's description and price. Some sales allow you to use an on line template with bar codes for easier tracking.

, Tag only the first piece if you are tagging an outfit.


You may choose to use a tagging gun, if you prefer, to save time.

, Separate girl's clothing from boy's clothing, and men's from women's. This will make it easier to place the clothing by department at the sale.

When the pallet comes in, break it down onto separate pallets or carts depending on the size of the freight.,
Take the carts and pallets to the correct aisles.,
Locate where the items go.,
Stock the items.,
When finished stocking, return to the back room and repeat until all of the pallets are done.,
Zone your aisle.",How to Stock Grocery Shelves," Be sure to organize each cart by aisle or product for maximum efficiency when you actually go out to stock it.;
, Make sure to leave a lot of breathing room for customers if you are working during opening hours!

, Items on the carts and pallets should be properly assigned to the aisle you're working in. Most stores should supply electronic devices (known here as Geminis or telezons/telxons/telxons) that let you scan items and find where they go on the shelves. Boxes also sometimes have stickers on them that might say the aisle number (found on the bottom of the lowest shelf, normally on a corner, a small sticker that's usually a letter and a number if you're in a big grocery store, ie; A-13 ) One of the fastest ways you can locate items is by type and brand, it takes a while to get an eye for it but it's crucial if you don't have price guns.

, Obviously the most important task! First of all, check how much stock is on the shelf. Push it back to see how much room you have, move stuff around if need be. Freight boxes should ALWAYS say how many items are in it. ( 12 - 5oz bottles, etc) Count carefully. Try your best to avoid ""partials"" which is only putting half of the items up and sending the rest back, unless your store allows that. If you're working in dairy or with other quick perishables, always check the date on the item before you stock new freight. Some boxes will say ""rotate"", this means to put stuff with the closest expiration date in front of the stuff with the farthest date. If you are stocking a shelf with one or two things left over, it's sometimes okay to stack them on top of the other items if you have room - or even sneak it behind something else on a shelf.

, Any and all overstock needs to be dated with the expiration date or marked with an ""OS"" for overstock. Properly label your stock for people working in the back room. Learn how to tag stuff for them to make their lives easier, they will greatly appreciate it.

, Zoning is front facing all the labels, checking the shelves for broken or stolen merchandise hiding behind other items, and just fixing things up and making it look pretty.

Mail the letter.",How to Write a Customer Service Cover Letter," Open a blank word processing document and set 1.5 inch (3.8Â cm) margins on each side. You want to select a font size and style that looks readable. Times, Arial, or Helvetica 10-14 point is ideal.Use letterhead if you have it. Remember to leave enough room for the letterhead at the top of the page.
Set up the letter using block-style paragraphing. You leave one line between paragraphs and donât indent. Instead, all text should line up with the left-hand side of the page.;
, If you donât have letterhead, then insert your name and current home address in a block near the top. You can also include your phone number.Hit enter twice and then insert the date. Remember to spell it out: âJanuary 12, 2017.â If you are outside the U.S., your date format might read â12 January 2017.â
Enter twice and insert the contact personâs name, title, employer, and address in a block beneath the date.

, You might know the name of who you are addressing. If so, use the name. A salutation should read âDear Ms. Smith.â The salutation goes two lines beneath the employerâs address.


If you donât know the name, you can write âDear Hiring Mangerâ or something similar.You can also call the company and ask who to address the letter to., In the first paragraph, you should identify that you are applying for the job. Identify the job and how you found out about it.Also state that you believe you are qualified.


For example, you might write: âI am writing to apply for the customer service position at U.S.A. Cell Phone, which was advertised on Moster.com. I believe I have the experience and skills necessary to make a great employee.âIf someone recommended that you apply for the job, include that information as well. âMichael Art recommended that I apply for the customer service position at U.S.A. Cell Phone. Having reviewed the job description, I believe I am a good fit for your company.â

, Before describing your experience, you should note what particular customer service experience the employer is searching for. Youâll want to tailor your experience to the needs of the employer.For example, the employer might want someone who can answer the phone and help clients troubleshoot problems. If possible, you should highlight this experience in your cover letter.
Donât lie. You canât say youâve done something if you havenât. However, think broadly. An employer might want a customer service representative to process credit card payments, which you might never have done. However, you might have handled billing, which you can mention. This will show you are detailed when it comes to numbers.

, The second paragraph should identify your experience in customer service. If you donât have any formal job experience, then you can mention volunteer experience. Quickly tick off what youâve done in those jobs.


For example, you can write, âI have extensive customer service experience. For the past five years, I have worked as a Customer Support Specialist in the tech industry, where I have been responsible for monitoring, reviewing, and updating customer accounts. I have proven myself to be a strong team player who communicates comfortably with a diverse range of customers.âIf you only have volunteer experience, you could write something like this: âI have entry level customer service experience from high school, when I volunteered to help in the Principalâs office. For two years, I provided support to staff, including answering in-coming calls from the public.â

, In the third paragraph, you can develop in a little more detail the skills you have acquired, including soft skills like âlisteningâ and âworking well with others.â Remember not to reproduce your entire resume here. However, you should hit the high points. You might also end this paragraph by stating you want a new job to develop these skills further.


For example, you can write: âAs you can see from my resume, I have extensive experience building and maintaining customer relationships. At my current job, listening is critical. I have to identify problems, forward calls to appropriate staff, and troubleshoot customer complaints. To perform my job well, I have learned to think on my feet and juggle many responsibilities. I would like to develop these skills in a full-time position at a company that will allow me to advance.â

, You should end by stating you are available for an interview and look forward to hearing from the hiring manager soon.You may also tell the person how you can be reached, such as by phone or email.


End with âVery Sincerely,â or âSincerely,â and move down four lines. Youâll sign in the space between the lines.
If youâre sending the cover letter by email, you can just type your name as an electronic signature.

, You probably have included a resume along with your cover letter. If so, make a note of that fact below your signature.You can type âEnclosure: resume.â If you are enclosing other documents, mention them as well.

, You want your cover letter to be informative but concise. Simplify complicated sentences and eliminate unnecessary words. Include transition words that make the letter easier to read.

, Common errors include typos, grammatical errors, and missing words. The hiring manager might easily drop your application in the âRejectâ box if you make these mistakes. For this reason, carefully proofread your letter.


Read the letter out loud. Often, you might hear a mistake that your eyes slide right over.
Read the letter backwards. Read the last sentence first, then read the one before it. This technique really forces you to focus on each individual sentence. You can find a lot of mistakes this way.
Ask a friend to read the letter.Another pair of eyes might catch mistakes.

, Print on 8.5x11 ivory paper. You donât have to use heavy stock paper unless your letterhead is already on it. Ideally, you should use the same type of paper for both your resume and your cover letter.Check the paper to make sure there is no smudging. Also make sure the print is dark enough.

, Remember to include your resume with the letter and send it in a business-sized envelope. If you are sending other documentsâsuch as a writing sampleâyou might want to send it in a larger envelope so that you donât fold anything.


When you email a cover letter, you should include your name and the job title in the subject line. For example, âMicah JonesâCustomer Support Position.â The body of your email will begin with the salutation."

Close the sale.",How to Sell Shoes," Your customer is coming to you for knowledge, expertise, and the best shoe they could possibly wind up with. In this situation, you need to be the expert. Don't just show them the shoe, but also help them learn something new about the product. What materials is it made out of? What season is it from? What was it inspired by?


This can also help you offer them something else, should the first shoe they're drawn to not work. With an encyclopedic knowledge of everything you have to offer, you're bound to find something that catches their eye.;
, With time, you'll slowly be able to recognize types of customers (generally speaking, of course). You'll recognize those customers with a sense of purpose and those customers who are just browsing, those that know exactly what they're looking for and those that haven't a clue. But beyond this, ask them questions. Get to know them. When you have their information handy, it ultimately saves them time and money!


Aim to greet and meet every customer that walks in your door. Smile and get to them as soon as possible, but without pouncing, to start building a relationship. Give them a second to evaluate the store and then ask how their day is going and how you can help.

, Offer to measure both of their feet to make sure their size is 100% accurate. This will vary by brand a bit, too. While they are sitting ask them what the shoes are going to be used for to help you identify their needs and improve their experience.


Run to storage and bring back the shoes requested, possibly also bringing back pairs that are slightly bigger or smaller, just in case (especially if they said sometimes they go back and forth between two sizes).

, Let's say you have a customer that came in looking for a nude, matte heel. They pick out one and request you to go get their size. While you're retrieving that pair, get a few more nude, matte heels you think they might like. They might not even have noticed the others in their haste to find the perfect shoe.


This goes double if you know of any shoes you don't have on display. This is why it's best to know your inventory like the back of your hand â there could be a sale in there that you wouldn't otherwise make.

, Teach them about the quality, fashion, comfort and value of their shoe; that way you can provide solutions and benefits to your customer. If you know of any feedback on that shoe, tell it to your new customer. Let them know that other customers say it's super comfortable, or that one pair tends to outshine another, for example.


In today's day and age, we're used to having all the information at our fingertips. There's an app for everything, answering all of our questions. But when it comes to the brick and mortar shoe store, you are the go-to guru. By giving them all information possible, you prevent them from returning the shoe, being unhappy with it and ensure they get what they're looking for out of something they could use daily.

, In order to sell shoes, you gotta have shoes to sell. You could buy them directly from a distributor or you could even make them yourself. Just make sure you're getting them for a good rate!


You'll need a variety of shoes in just about every size, and multiples at that. This is a large investment, especially if you can't sell them all. If you don't have thousands of dollars to spend on fancy kicks, team up with an existing shoe seller that needs your expertise.

, With technology these days, almost anyone is capable of almost anything. Whether you have three pairs of shoes to sell or 30,000, you can get your product online. You'll need some sort of storefront to do so â here are the major ones to consider:


Your own website
eBay
Etsy
Craigslist
Google Shopping campaign

, No one will buy the shoe if they know nothing about it. If it's lacking in description, not only is it a deterrent to buy, but it comes off as shady, too, making your website or ad look sketchy â why would a seller purposefully withhold information? Here's what to consider:


List the manufacturer's original size and its international equivalents. If the original size is not known, list length and width measurements inside and out.
Describe the color, type (dress, casual, athletic, etc.) and style (oxford, brogue, pump, etc.) as accurately as possible.
List the materials the shoe is made from and describe the method of construction if possible.
If the shoes are not new, describe the condition specifically noting any flaws.

, Take clear, well-lit photographs from all angles and show as many as you can. Size is only important for fit. Shoe buyers are usually most interested in style, so photos are very important.


Get good photos taken of your shoes, hiring a photographer if you have to. They should be realistic, but flattering. Make sure each shoe is against a white background and every detail can be seen from various angles.

, Sometimes brands differ in their sizing (length and width) from the norm. If this is the case, include these details, like the length of useable sole. That means measure the shoe inside along the insole from heel to toe. A 9 or 39 in one brand can differ significantly from another.


Let's say a Steve Madden 9 may measure 9 and 3/4"" while a Jimmy Choo 39 may measure 9 and 7/8"". Small differences do matter, especially when buying through a screen. If you include the insole measurement it can save some back and forth questioning with buyers.

, When it comes to the condition of used shoes, give as accurate a description and documentation as possible. If the shoes are not new, ""gently used or worn"" can be rather non-descript. Explain how they are used â i.e. ""worn twice; some wear on tread, minor scratches on heel, but leather upper pristine."" This grants the customer a sense of solace and makes you appear responsible and honest.


Include photos of any flaws or wear. This can help avoid an angry buyer down the line who may feel they were not well-informed and were duped.
Small additions such as those to your listings can help avoid delayed contact with buyers or potential buyers who may have questions. The more complete your listing the more attractive it will be to others.

, If your shoes are a reasonable cost but your shipping rates are outrageous, your customers will find somewhere else to go that's more reasonable. Offer them several options, ranging from super-quick delivery to something cheaper and not so speedy. And make sure the shoes can get there without incurring any damage.


Sometimes you can ship items like shoes for less without the box. It's always nice for buyers to have more than one shipping option. Allowing them to choose if they want the original shoe box or not is a good option for saving a little on shipping.

, If you're a budding entrepreneur (and even if you're not), you'll need a way to get your shoes, well, on the feet of potential customers. Offer deals to first-time buyers and returning buyers. Purchase ad space on other websites, like Facebook. Get word of mouth going in your area so you can slowly expand your audience.


Shoes aren't in the same category as a lot of other things â they're something that customers are always looking for a discount on. If you're having trouble selling a specific style, brand, or size of shoe, slap a discount sticker on it. You may see it fly off your shelves at its new cost.

, Many humans are pretty basic when it comes to the art of persuasion. We all want to be fashionable, cool, and look good. If you say that Kobe Bryant or Kim Kardashian, for example, wears these exact brand of shoes, there's is a chance that that will perk up their interest. We often look to celebrities for cues on what's trendy, and this is the perfect time to put this factor to good use.


That being said, for some people this can backfire. Try your best to read the customer. If they dress and act like they value being their own individual, you might want to stay away from the celebrities. Some people hear ""Kim Kardashian"" and they want to run in the opposite direction.

, We've all had experiences with salespeople that are sallow, unfriendly, and just don't seem to want to get a sale. What do we, as the customer, do in that situation? Leave, generally. To get that sale, be friendly and personable. Talk about your own shoe woes if it's fitting. Make yourself a person that knows a lot about shoes and has plenty of experience that just so happens to be selling them, too. If you are friendly and open, they will likely trust you more â and return in the future.


Customers need to be judged on their lifetime value, not the value of their current purchase. A high-roller that comes in spending $1,000 on one pair of shoes one time is less valuable than a lower-class customer that spends $50 on shoes once a month for the next few years. Keep this in mind when choosing which clients to gush over â it's not as obvious as it seems.

, When they're debating between which shoes to buy (or if to buy at all), keep throwing out the compliments (so long as they're believable, of course). If they're wearing fancy shoes, they are dressing to impress. Flatter them by saying, ""I can tell that you are very classy,"" etc. If they're wearing Nikes, they are probably a casual or sporty kind of person. No matter what they are wearing, praise them. Let them know they should trust their buying choices.


Praise how the shoes look on, too. That is, if they look good. If they're trying on multiple pairs, let them know which one looks best on them and why.
Don't be ridiculous. If you have customer that clearly just rolled out of bed, don't compliment them on their hair and makeup. Talk to them about a shoe that compliments their hectic schedule and lather on the flattery when it slips on their foot. They look like they're getting ready for the red carpet know, don't they?

, If you get a customer that seems to be dilly-dallying, you can try giving them a cause to buy and buy now. Either this special discounted price is going to be gone shortly or the shoe itself is about to be gone from the shelves. They can't wait â if they do, it'll be gone.


Try the ""out of stock"" trick. If you can see they are looking at a particular shoe, tell them you'll see if you have any more in stock. Go in the back, wait a few minutes, and come out triumphant! Tell the customer this is the ""last"" in stock and they are so lucky!

, When you close the sale, remember to thank your costumer for their business. Give them a business card, let them know about any upcoming promotions, and tell them that if they have any problems at all, they should come back and you can work something out to make sure they're happy. Next time they need a pair of shoes (or friends of theirs need a recommendation on where to buy shoes), your name will be the first to come up.


If possible, give them incentive to come in again. Have a promotion running where if you buy a product now, next month you can buy another pair at 1/2 off. Aim to turn your new customers into returning customers. And the more memorable you make their customer experience, the more likely this is to happen.

Con artists show up in your store during opportunities times.,
Scam operators choose their victims carefully.,
Scam operators are ""nice"" people.,
Scam operators try to confuse you.,
At the FIRST sign of fishiness, grab a manager!",How to Spot a Scammer in Retail," Whenever they think they can find an associate that hasn't gotten into their groove yet basically. This could be during a shift change, right when the store opens, right before the store closes or during a busy rush.;
, They discriminate. Very young, or very old females are choice. As are new employees or shy employees. Basically someone that appears to be vulnerable.

, They're charismatic and overly complimentary. They can be very agreeable for most of the interaction, this is to make you let your guard down and trust them. Scammers put a lot of thought into their appearance, they want to blend in, not stick out. They also want to appear powerful, so they may dress in expensive looking clothing. They might also try to prove their power or wealth by showing off. For instance, I once had a man show me his glasses frames and say ""I bought these for $1000"". No he didn't, because I've never seen a frame more expensive than $550 and those were Chanel. He also said they were Japanese, but they were actually German.

, The deal starts off simple, but he/she makes a slight change... it's not too major but they complicate the process a little bit. Then he/she needs you to make another change, now things are getting too complicated but you're trying to be accommodating to this nice customer, who is about to spend a lot of money. The scam operators might even go so far as to spend a lot of money but then suddenly he/she wants a refund because he/she changed their mind, or you did something ""wrong"". What they're really trying to do is make your job so complicated and frustrating that they get you to a point where you just want to end this and give them what they want. Do NOT do it.

, Say something like ""I'm gonna involve my general manager to make sure we can fully assist you"" At that point you'll see the scam operators frustration and the bad guy should come out. This is where he/she is gonna make his/her final stand and see what he/she can get out of the manager. The scam operators thinks that the manager is going to try to appease them and save the sale buy taking a little hit and giving him/her something for free or give them a big break. Do not let that happen, make sure you walk away from the situation and clue in the manager that this is not an ordinary sale.

Everything about your manner should say âIâm glad youâre here!â, How you look is a key part of your greeting. You need to look like you care about your job. A conservative, professional outfit will convey that message. Unless you work in a store with a specific dress code that states otherwise, avoid provocative clothing that might offend customers or make them feel uncomfortable., 80% of customers say they want to be noticed and nearly all welcome a friendly greeting.You donât have to greet each customer right away, but you do need to acknowledge him or her with eye contact and a smile.If stocking shelves or working in the back, stop to greet a new arrival. At the very least, tell her you will be with her shortly. Studies show that customers are much happier waiting if they have been greeted first.If serving another customer, ask him if he minds if you quickly greet the new arrival before you do so.Use a bell on the door to let you know when new customers have arrived, so that you can be sure to greet them promptly.
Try to greet incoming customers within 30 seconds.

, It pays to remember frequent customersâ likes and dislikes. Knowing what someone orders at a coffee shop or restaurant makes them feel like a regular. If you work at clothing store, remembering that a customer loves pink or is fond of a certain brand will make her feel like you care. Personal attention like this is a great way to create customer loyalty., Donât just tell them where to look for what they want. They will appreciate it if you walk them to the product and show them precisely where it is., The more specific details you can get on what a customer is looking for, the better you can satisfy his needs. If at a nutrition store and looking for protein powder, you might ask if he is trying to lose weight, built muscle, or tone. Does he want something for after workouts or to stave off hunger? If a customer is looking for shorts at a clothing store, you might ask about how formal or the type of fabric. Questions show you care., Donât try to read your customers before greeting them. You never want to assume someone wants to be left alone. Always greet an arriving customer warmly, but if she responds coldly or not at all, tell her you will be nearby if they need help and give them space., The effect of a great greeting can easily be lost with a bad goodbye. Donât just thank them for coming in. Walk customers to the door and open it for them. Ask anyone who looks like they could use a hand â older customers, pregnant women, parents wrangling their children â if he or she would like help carrying their packages to the car., Usually, the answer is âno, just looking.â Youâll usually get a similar response â âjust lookingâ â If you ask customers if you can help them find something. And donât start off with a canned speech, either. The key is to promote a natural conversation that makes the customer feel welcome and relaxed., You want customers to know your name if they need something. Giving them your name also transforms you from a faceless employee to a person they can feel comfortable with.Try to use your name more than once to be sure they remember it.

, If it is a frequent customer, you should greet him by name. âJack! Welcome back!â Hearing oneâs own name stimulates specific regions of the brain that makes people listen more closely to whatever comes next.If you donât remember his name, at least let him know you remember them: âHi! Nice to see you again!â People enjoy recognition. It will make them want to return., If you donât recognize the customer, ask her if she has visited the store before. This greeting has been shown to increase sales by up to 16%.If she has been there, ask what she bought and if she liked it. This gives the opportunity for positive reinforcement or to address concerns.
If she has not been there before, offer to show her around the store.

, Weather is the old stand-by of small talk for a reason. Itâs inoffensive and something that everyone can talk about. Be sure to listen to your customerâs responses and reply appropriately. The key is to foster a natural conversation in order to put customers at ease, making them more likely to buy., If there is anything interesting or unusual in your store â a piece of art, a new display, a pet â mention it. Anything that gets a customer relaxed and talking will help sales."

Because you will be spending a lot of time together setting up your booth and selling through the duration of the flea market, this should be someone you can easily get along with. Also, because you will be handling cash transactions, the person needs to be reliable and trustworthy.
Choose a booth partner with the correct merchandise. When considering the type of merchandise you and your potential booth partner sell, it's important that your products are either complementary or unrelated. They should not be so similar that you are competing for the same customers within the same booth.

, If the spot will be divided in half, the cost can be easily split; however, if one seller is only going to have a small table or portion of an area, dividing the booth costs can prove more difficult. Be sure the costs are clear upfront to avoid any conflict later.

, Agree on who will be responsible for set-up, selling and clean-up. When working out the details for how to share a flea market booth, remember that shoppers may not realize that you are not partners. Be prepared to field questions about each other's merchandise and prices.

, A benefit to sharing a booth is additional manpower. When it's time for a meal or bathroom break, your booth partner can watch over your merchandise and take care of sales in your absence and ensure nothing is stolen. Also, a helper can lend a hand waiting on customers or wrapping and bagging merchandise if you find your booth very busy.

Select something to sell that you enjoy and that there is a demand for in your city. What is hard to find? Do you have wholesale access to something on the cheap from which you might profit?
Used books, newspapers, and zines are often sold on the street. This is something you can purchase at yard sales or Goodwill stores and mark-up for sale at Farmer's Markets or high-traffic street fairs. Or, if you've got a mile-long book collection, it could be a fun way to clear out the old and make some money for new purchases.
Antiques and novelties can likewise be purchased cheaply at yard sales and second-hand stores, then marked-up for sale outdoors. Acquired a porcelain doll collection from a relative that you've got no room for? Sell it to someone who does!
Decorative swords and knives are available in bulk packages on call-in television sales channels, and are often marked up for sale at music festivals or other themed events.
Firewood is always a useful and necessary sale item in rural areas or near campgrounds. If you have a supply, selling firewood can be as easy as putting a sign in your driveway.
Fruit and other produce is commonly sold at roadside stands and farmers' markets. If you've got an apple or cherry tree whose fruit always goes to the birds, it may be a good idea to package up your produce and sell it. In rural areas, it's also common to put out produce like peppers and eggs with a collection jar, operating on the honors system. It can be a good way to get rid of excess produce your family can't eat, and make a little money while you do it.;
,


Have an artsy compulsion that results in a lot of stuff? Start selling it!
Pottery is often sold at farmers' markets and street fairs. It goes well alongside food products, but is also versatile enough to sell alongside paintings and other art. Sell cookware, cups, pots, and vases as well as small sculptures and clay novelties.
Paintings and photographs are often popular items at outdoor markets. In high-traffic areas, a striking visual sells itself. Learn to price accordingly, as most people don't carry lots of cash around, even at street fairs. Consider offering deals for multiple purchases.
Jewelry, especially around holidays, is something everyone wants to buy--either for themselves or for a loved one. Around Christmas is a safe bet, but jewelry is a popular birthday item as well, so stay out there!
Sculptures, woodworking, and leather crafts are popular at outdoor events like renaissance fairs and harvest festivals.
Screen-printed t-shirts that you can make on and order-by-order basis are a safe bet for music festivals. Allowing people to decide what to put on their shirts cuts down on the work you do before hand, but make sure you bring enough supplies to keep up with demand at the event.

,


Does everyone rave about your homemade tortillas? Is your ice-cream to die for? Share your delicious treats with the rest of us!
Tacos and tamales are commonly sold, even from backpacks in some neighborhoods. Make them ahead of time and wrap them in tin foil to make them clean and easy to handle.
Popsicles and ice-cream sell like crazy at hot outdoor events. If you've got a way to keep them cool without breaking the bank (reusable ice packs are a must) then you've got a reliable seller in the summer months.
Candy like homemade chocolate truffles or cookies or bars is a sweet indulgence and makes for a welcome break from beets and arugula at any farmers' market.
Lemonade or specialty drinks like coffee, shakes, or malts can be tailored to any event. Sell warm beverages like cider in the fall and creative lemonade flavors in the summer. Basil-watermelon lemonade in August? Yes please.
TIP: Creative local flavors like huckleberry and salmon in the Pacific Northwest or acorn-fed pork from Virginia will have locavores throwing their money at you. Work with other vendors to collaborate on ingredients, making your product--whatever it is--truly unique.

Are you the best delta blues guitar player in town? Take your talents to the street like they did back in the '30s and collect coins in a hat or coffee can for added authenticity.
Painting faces at events where there will be lots of children will create a welcome break for parents and babysitters alike.
Draw caricature. If you have a talent for humorous exaggerations in your drawings, caricature is particularly popular in tourist locations, such as bigger cities. Give a traveling couple a unique gift from your hometown.
Perform puppet plays at outdoor music festivals to give sun-drenched revelers a spectacle of a smaller scale. They'll love it.
Mime doesn't have to be the butt of awkward jokes if you do it right. If you've always had an interest in this tradition, take it to the streets and get people laughing for real.

,


Is there a high traffic area in your town, where you're likely to come across lots of people? Centrally locating yourself at a park or town square will maximize the traffic for your sales.
If you're selling food, an office park can be an excellent idea during lunch hours.
If you're selling goods, a farmer's market or street fair is likewise smart as a way of distinguishing your jewelry or sculptures from the food of the other vendors.

,


Just because it may be a great location to sell things doesn't make it legal.
You'll need to register with the county clerk and research available locations that are zoned for commerce before you start doing any selling on the street. See Step Three below for more information.

,


Likewise, playing music just around the corner from another musician will cut down on both of your operations. Make sure you're out of earshot of anyone else trying to be heard.
The most convenient place, though, isn't necessarily the best. Your front yard would be a great place to sell your apples, but not if you live on a county road no one drives down. Your neighbors will only buy so many before they're as sick of them as you are.

,


Sales tax permits are required from your local and state government revenue agencies.
A food handler's permit is necessary if you're planning on selling food products, which means you'll have to take the food handler's test, usually available online.
A business license from the city or county clerk's office is required.
Additional location-specific vendor permits may be required. Check with both the city clerk's office and with any organizers you might be working with, including the farmers' market or festival organizers you may be working with.

,


Obviously selling illegal drugs is...well, illegal, but what about selling pickles at a music festival? What about selling your chicken eggs in used cartons? Hidden regulations govern all sorts of food items, so you need to be very careful about checking for your state's laws. Washington state, for instance, does not allow eggs to be sold in used containers, but Idaho does.
Pets are commonly sold, but you need to make sure they're registered and legal animals. No selling endangered turtles or reptiles, for instance.
Copyrighted material including movies and music can get you into Federal trouble if you're selling it. Don't sell any pirated music or movies unless it was created by you or you have the express permission of the creator to sell it.

,


It seems like a fun idea to be self-employed, working your own hours, but will it be cost-effective?
Keep track of your expenses. Like a brick-and-mortar business, street sales depend upon good financial practices.
If you're selling $200 bucks worth of ice-cream a day, that's great, but not if you're spending $300 on organic milk.

,


After calculating your expenses, price your products so that you'll profit.
Don't forget to calculate the cost of labor. Your time is one of the biggest expenses you have in street sales. Account for it. In the beginning, you may make less than you hope, so you'll have to balance out what's possible to sell and what's possible to make.

,


What's your story? Even though you're not going to be paying for prime-time commercials like Pepsi, it's still helpful to give some thought to the way you present yourself to the consumer.
If you're a mother-daughter jewelry operation, name your business something that resonates with that experience.
Consider promotional tactics, like buy-on-get-one-free sales to get the word out about your delicious tostadas, or play open-mic nights to let everyone know you'll be busking for dimes during the music festival next weekend.
Free business cards are available online. Print some up with your contact information and a description of your business.

,


Customer service is where a business fails or succeeds. Even if you've got the best wood carvings in the tri-State area, nobody will buy them if you treat their presence like an inconvenience.
Consider what to do if someone doesn't like your product. What if your perfect caricature, which you've just spent an hour laboring over, makes the customer mad? Will you try to make them pay? Will you offer to draw another one free, losing out on the cost of materials?
Consider possible no-win scenarios to practice before you have to confront an uncomfortable scenario.

,


Your appearance should match the customer's expectation of the service. If you're selling food, you need to look clean.
Even if you're playing dirty blues on the street corner, make sure you look like you're supposed to be doing it. Wearing cargo shorts and a basketball jersey might be a strange choice.
Hygiene is your first concern. If you're handling food, make sure you've got hand-washing materials available at your booth.

Make sure the change you give and the price of the product together add up to the cash the customer gave you.,
Add up the amount the customer gives you.,
Count up from the amount of the purchased item to the other amount paid.,
Count out loud to avoid confusion.,
Start with coins.,
Hand back paper money next.,
Check your work.",How to Give Back Correct Change1," You want the customer to leave with the same value they gave you, only now part of that value will be the product, and the rest change.Itâs that simple. For example:


If they gave you $20 to buy a $5 book, they will leave with $5 worth of book plus $15 worth of change, for a total value of $20.;
, Before you can make change, you'll need to know how much money you've been given. As you count the money, place it on the register or table in front of you both. When you are done counting, state the amount paid. This will ensure that there is no confusion or disagreement about how much the customer gave you.

, For example, if they are purchasing a sandwich that costs $7.59, and they gave you $20, you would start at $7.59 and give them money, counting up until you reached $20.

, You donât need to count out every single coin, but it is important to at least call out the running total whenever you reach the end of a particular unit such as pennies, nickels, dimes, or quarters. With bills mistakes are more costly, so itâs a good idea to keep a running count.


For example, if you were given $10 for a $6 product, you would either:
Count the one dollar bills and then give the total: âOne, two, three, and four makes ten.â
Or add up as you go: âSeven, eight, nine, and ten.â

, Do pennies first, then nickels, dimes, and quarters before handing out paper money. When you give back change the other way around, it's awkward and your customer is more likely to drop the change as they are already holding the paper money. If your customers drop your money when you pass it to them, this is probably why.


In our initial example, you are starting with $7.59 (the price of the sandwich), so you would hand back:
1 penny (âthatâs $7.60â)
1 nickel (â7.65â)
1 dime (â7.75â)
1 quarter (â8.00â)
While this is the most efficient combination of coins, it doesnât really matter how you add up to $8.00, so long as you get there.

, Once you reach an even dollar amount, start counting out bills until you have added up to the amount they gave you. Returning to our example:


You have added up to $8.00 and need to continue to $20.00, so now you would hand back:
2 one dollar bills (â9, 10â)
1 ten dollar bill (âand 10 more makes 20â)

, You gave the customer .01 + .05 + .10 + .25 = .41 cents in change. You then gave her 1 + 1 + 10 = $12 in cash, for a total of $12.41 in change. $7.59 + $12.41 = $20 â the amount the customer paid.

, Especially for transaction not involving coins, it is usually simple to just count up.


For example, if the customer bought a $42 hat and gave you $47, you would count:
1 five dollar bill (âYou gave me 42, plus 5 makes 47.â)

, It may not be immediately obvious how to get from $12.78 to $23.03. Here is where a little initial subtraction can simplify things:Start with the amount paid. Subtract from it to get a simpler number. In this case, 23.03 â .03 = $23.00.
Now subtract the same amount from the price: 12.78 â .03 = $12.75.
It's clear now that you'll need to first give back a quarter.
1 quarter takes you from $12.78 to $13.03. (âthatâs $13.03â)
1 ten dollar bill (âplus 10 equals 23.03â)

, As another example of a more complex situation, imagine that you're a waiter and a customer is purchasing a meal worth $112.31. They give you 6 twenties, a nickel, and a penny.


Add the amount paid by counting up as you put the money down: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and six cents. Tell the customer the amount paid: ""$120.06"".
The customer gave you a bizarre amount of change, so this might be a good time to do a bit of subtraction. 120.06 - .06 = $120.00, and 112.31 - .06 = $112.25. Better. You need 3 quarters.
Now start adding up from $112.31 to $120.06.
3 quarters (""takes us to 113.06"") - We know this works from our earlier subtraction exercise.
2 one dollar bills (""114, 115"")
1 five dollar bill (""and 5 is 120.06"")
Check your work: You gave .25 + .25 + .25 + 1 + 1 + 5 = $7.75. $7.75 + $112.31 = $120.06 â the amount the customer paid.

Assess the suitability of a mobile card reader to your business.,
Understand the costs.,
Locate and compare processors.,
Begin using your chosen processor.",How to Process a Credit Card over the Telephone2," Mobile card readers are a great option for mobile businesses or small business that have not had time to build up the credit history necessary to receive a traditional credit card merchant account. These card readers are provided to sellers by the payment processor, who then handles the transaction with your bank and the buyer's. This greatly simplifies the transactions process, but comes with its own set of issues. For example, you'll need some sort of internet connection to receive payment. For businesses operating in remote areas, this may not work out so well.


You may also pay more for manually entering credit cards, due to the risk, and may be charged a higher fee for accepting foreign credit cards.
In order to use the card reader, you have to have a compatible device, which is usually a smart phone or tablet.
In addition, some of these processors may not allow you to access your money immediately, which can be an issue for a small business struggling with cash flows., While using a card reader is simpler to set up and use than a traditional merchant account for most small business, this ease is made up for by the fees that these processors charge. Mobile payment processors, much like more traditional merchant accounts, charge a percentage on each sale. For merchant accounts, this is usually one to two percent. However, mobile processors may charge three percent or more. In addition, some of these processors have monthly fees, fees for the card reader itself, or refund fees.


Make sure you understand the costs involved before you make a decision to use a mobile card reader. You don't want to have any surprises once you've signed on to use a service., The market for mobile card readers is large and still growing, as both startups and large corporations look to get into the game. When looking for a mobile processor, consider the pros and cons of each option, especially in accessibility and pricing. Some of the more popular processors are:


Square. Square is a very small card reader that can be attached to almost any smartphone. Square charges a flat transaction fee of 2.75 percent. The reader itself can be purchased at a number of retail stores. You get your money in 1-2 business days after the transaction.
PayPal Here. PayPal's mobile reader links up to transactions that are processed and stored in your vendor PayPal account. It charges a flat fee of 2.7 percent. With PayPal, your money is available almost immediately.
PayAnywhere. PayAnywhere is Wells Fargo's mobile payment service. It charges 2.69 percent on transactions unless you qualify for their storefront solution, which offers a free tablet and a 1.69 percent rate, but requires that you process $5,000 per month in transactions. You get your money in about a day with this service., When you've decided on a mobile processor, make sure that you have an appropriate mobile device to use with the card reader. Then, visit the processor's website or a retail store to purchase their card reader. Follow the provided instructions to set up your account and begin accepting payments."

Understand merchant accounts.,
Get a credit card terminal.,
Use an imprinter to process credit cards manually.",How to Process a Credit Card over the Telephone3," A merchant account is a bank account used to receive funds from credit card and debit card sales. These accounts are set up with banks, who process the transactions and deposit the transaction balances, minus their fee, into the bank account of the vendor (the seller who accepted the credit card purchase). This is the traditional way for vendors to accept credit cards. It is cheaper than mobile processors, which involve an additional middleman, the aggregator. However, it also requires that a business have a certain credit history and sales volume. If your business meets this criteria, consider the following options for using a merchant account., A credit card terminal is the most common and in many cases the most cost effective way of accepting credit cards. These devices allow you to swipe a card, enter the transaction amount, and then finalize the transaction on the spot. They transmit information safely and effectively to your merchant bank and can also be used to provide your customer with a receipt.


Terminals can be obtained from your merchant bank for a fee, which is usually a few hundred dollars.
Terminals require connectivity to process, usually a telephone line.

, If you don't have access to an internet connection, but still need to process credit cards, you can use the old-fashioned method of accepting credit cards: an imprinter. This device creates a carbon copy of the credit card that you can then use the process the transaction later via one of the other methods, such as visiting a bank or entering them into a terminal. The downside is that you assume risk by carrying around copies of your customers' credit cards.


You can usually get an imprinter cheaply or for free from the bank where you got your merchant account.

, Three skills that are important for retail jobs are leadership, being responsible, and good people skills.Even if you have never had a retail job before, you have probably developed these skills through other experiences. These skills are often called ""soft skills.""


Volunteering in the community, babysitting, involvement in sports teams or clubs, having a leadership role in a project or group activity are all examples that you have developed these skills.

, A cover letter is a great way to introduce yourself and cover any topics that you cannot convey in your resume. Your cover letter should not be more than one page and should be tailored to the job you are applying for. It should include a heading, introduction, body, and a closing. Your cover letter should not just repeat what is in your resume. It needs to tell the employer who you are, and why they should hire you.

, You should practice discussing your work experience, why you want to work for the company, and what skills do you have that would be an asset to the company. You should know your resume inside and out. You should also be prepared to answer some questions specific to working in retail.You should also do some research on the company prior to the interview.
You may be asked: ""Do you work well with people?"" ""Do you have reliable transportation?"" ""How would you handle a rude customer?"" ""Can you describe a time when you provided good customer service?"" and many other situational questions like these.You should anticipate the type of questions you will be asked and develop some answers. It may help to do a mock interview with one of your friends.
A good answer for ""Do you work well with people?"" would include not only saying yes, but also a specific example of a time when you worked on something with other people. The other people could be classmates or coworkers from another job.
A good answer for ""How would you handle an upset customer?"" would include listening to the customer's concern and working with the customer to resolve the issue. Also mention that you would make sure the resolution was still inline with the policies and regulations of the company.
It will be helpful if you keep a few specific examples in the back of your mind about a time you provided good customer service and any situation in which you were able to resolve a problem with your coworkers, a customer, or a manager. Note that a customer isn't always a person physically shopping in a store - it could be a client to a previous employer or any communication with a user of the company's product (including a website).

, Your appearance is the first thing that the interviewer will notice about you, and they will likely form opinions about you based on the way you look and present yourself.This includes not only your dress, but the way you carry yourself as well.


Dress professionally and neatly to show the employer that you are serious about the job. Men should wear pressed collared dress shirts, dress slacks, tie, and polished dress shoes. Women should wear a nice blouse, slacks or skirt and dress shoes.Your shoe choice should reflect the job that you are applying for. If you are interviewing at a high-end fashion or lingerie store, high heels would be appropriate for a woman. If you are applying to a hardware or department store, a nice pair of flats would be appropriate.

, Remember that the interview process is a two way street. You should be evaluating if the company is a good fit for you as well.Asking questions also shows the interviewer that you are serious about working at the company.


Questions you may want to ask include: ""How many hours a week am I expected to work?"" ""Will I be required to work nights and/or weekends?"" ""How are employees reviewed and evaluated?"" ""What would a typical day be like in this position?"", Following up is the last step of the interview process. You should send a follow up letter within 24 hours. Make sure that you send the follow up letter during business hours Most interviewers prefer an email, but you can send a handwritten thank you note as well.Make sure you proofread the letter before you send it. You are being evaluated every time you communicate with the interviewer.
Your letter should thank the interviewer for their time, mention something that was discussed during the interview, and reiterate why you are a good fit for the position."

You must obtain the tax certificate before you plan on selling, although how far in advance depends on the state.Some states have different types of tax certificates â some are the same no matter how long youâre selling for, some issue temporary certs depending on how frequently you sell.When in doubt, ask the flea market youâre selling at â they can usually tell you what you need.;
, If you live in an area that has multiple flea markets, you might want to spend a few weekends checking them out and deciding where youâd like to sell. If thereâs only one flea market near you, you should still go â it will give you some necessary information before you begin selling there.


Look to see where the booths are set up and where the most traffic comes through.
Note what other vendors are selling and for how much. Youâre likely to be more successful if youâre selling something not many people have or, if you are, if you sell at comparable prices., All flea markets will charge you a fee to rent booth space in the market. This rate varies from market to market, so make sure you know what that rate is up front.


Some markets have daily or monthly rates. If youâve never sold at a flea market before, you might want to pay for just one day until you know if you want to commit to a full month.
Some markets also have booth space in a covered area. They charge more for these spaces, but youâll be protected from weather., Checking out the flea market you want to sell at before you register for a booth is helpful because it can help you find the best spot for your booth.


Itâs best to be near the entrance and in an area where there seems to be a lot of foot traffic.
You might not get your first choice of booth, so make sure you give yourself a few options., Once youâve decided which flea market youâd like to sell at, find out how you go about registering for a booth and reserving your space. Some flea markets will let you pay and reserve a spot in advance, and some give out booth space on a first-come-first-serve basis. Make sure you know how your flea market does it.


If your flea market assigns booth space on the same day as youâre selling, try to get there early to increase your chances of getting the best spot., If you already make a product â jewelry, soap, or candles, for example â you should make sure you have enough product stored up to sell. You donât want to get to the market and run out right away. If you donât make a product, you can acquire inventory by purchasing items from garage sales and thrift stores.


A good way to start an inventory is by hosting your garage or rummage sale at the flea market. Bring all of the stuff youâd sell at a garage sale and sell it from your booth instead. This gives you inventory to start with and also eliminates the need for you to advertise the garage sale â flea markets will advertise themselves., You want to make sure that you can make a profit on the things you sell. You should calculate ahead of time how much it cost you to make (or buy) the products youâre selling and then how much of a profit youâd like to make off of them. Adding those two amounts together will give you your selling price., Once youâve calculated prices for your inventory, make sure you have clearly marked prices on all of your goods. You donât want to get to the flea market, have someone ask you how much something is, and then realize you have no idea., Youâll need quite an extensive list of supplies to get your booth prepped for your first sale. Youâll need a table (or tables) to display your goods, a chair (for you to sit on while youâre selling), coverings for the table, racks if you sell clothes, pens, shopping bags for your customers, a calculator and cash box, a receipt book, any display cases you might want to use, and umbrella if it rains (or a canopy if you can afford it), hand sanitizer, business cards, and stuff to keep you occupied.Make sure you know the exact measurements of your booth before you get your supplies together. You donât want to arrive at the flea market only to discover that you canât sell anything because your tables donât fit.
Check with the flea market to see if they have a list of prohibited items, or rules about booths are decorated.

, You can assume that customers will be ready and waiting to hit the booths as soon as the flea market opens. That means you might need to arrive at the flea market quite early to have enough time to prep your booth and make sure youâre ready to sell.

, Make sure that you have a return policy â do you accept same day exchanges or returns? Do you require a receipt for returns? Are all sales final? â figured out before someone asks about it. It should also be clearly displayed in your booth so that your customers can see it., Even if you donât sell one type of item, you can keep your merchandise organized by placing similar items together. So all the clothing should be grouped together â by size â all of the jewelry, all of the knickknacks, etc. This will help your customers more easily find what theyâre looking for., Since youâll be covering your table with a cloth, you can use a lot of different objects to adjust the height of your display in different places. Boxes are a good way to add height and highlight merchandise you think might sell well. You can also use whatever bins or crates you use to transport your merchandise to the flea market., With things like Square, itâs easy to take credit card information right at your table, so youâre not restricted by cash-only sales. It also has the added benefit of creating receipts that you can send directly to your customers, rather than having to handprint one.


Opening a business checking account lets you accept checks, too, but you might take a check only to find out thereâs insufficient funds. Unless you have a way to follow up in such a situation, you might want to avoid accepting checks., If you notice some of your merchandise isnât getting much attention or if you notice that something is getting a lot of attention but is buried in the back of your booth, rearrange your merchandise.You should also rearrange your merchandise as you sell it, either by restocking or rearranging what you already have out so you donât have an obvious bare spot.
Donât rearrange too often, however. You donât want a customer to come looking for something they saw earlier in the day and then not be able to find it.

, People will be more likely to come to your booth and look around at what you have if you seem open to conversation. Look â and actually be! â willing to answer your customerâs questions or describe the certain characteristics or value of particular items.Be careful not to be too aggressive, though. If youâre constantly asking your shoppers if they need anything, itâs likely theyâll get annoyed and walk away. Give them time to look before you start telling them about products.

, Some people come to flea markets expecting the prices on merchandise to be a starting point for haggling, rather than a set price. Not everyone does this, but some people will. Know ahead of time how much youâre willing to come down on prices and what your absolute minimum is, and donât be afraid to stick to it."

Script what you want to say.,

Let them save the world.,
Try the âpuppy dogâ close.,
Appeal to the customerâs rational side.,
Try the âassumptive close.â This technique works by acting as if the customer has already agreed to the sale, turning to the next questions: when they want the product, would they like it delivered, how they would like to pay, and so forth.Try moving slowly from the customerâs questions about the product into this technique, saying something like, âOK, how much money would you like to donate today?â âHow many cases do you want to purchase?â or âWhen would you like us to deliver it?â
The assumptive close relies on the âassumptive principle,â where acting as if something is true makes it hard for the customer to deny it without feeling embarrassed.

,
Give them time.",How to Sell Door to Door Products when You're Shy," It is very hard for a shy person to speak âoff the cuffâ and to improvise in most situations. Make things easier for yourself by writing out exactly what you want to say to potential buyers in advance. A short script is all you need. Try something like, âHello, my name is Gina and Iâm with the charity XYZ. Can I talk to you for a moment about our local fund-raising efforts?âOnce you have a script, rehearse it as often as possible. Review the sales pitch when you have a free moment, over lunch, or during the evening. Read it aloud at least once per day. That way, it will roll off your tongue when you hit the streets.;
, Keep in mind that some customers will have questions about you, your work, and your organization. Try to avoid being taken off guard. Anticipate the questions and have pat answers. For instance, if youâre working for a charity, chances are good that some customers will want to know exactly what your charity does and what it funds. Prepare a good reply.

, Many people will turn you down. This is just the nature of door-to-door sales. In fact, salespeople have an average âcontactâ rate with customers of about 30%-40%. Out of that, less than half show interest and even fewer act. Youâre looking at a success rate of 10% or lower.Youâll have to have a golden tongue in order to persuade them.


One idea is to include more information about your charity or the cause for which you are collecting. Potential customers may be more likely to buy if they can relate to your cause.
Maintain a polite, respectful demeanor. Move people with your words and do not try to manipulate them â put your âfrowny faceâ away. If a customer declines, thank them and respect their decision. Do not antagonize them with continued appeals.

, Shyness for some people is ultimately a fear of feeling or being embarrassed in front of others. We start to run over every thought and detail in our minds and become paralyzed by self-awareness.A possible way to deal with this reaction is to treat your interaction with strangers like a stage performance.


Think of yourself as an actor playing a part â not really you. Taking such an approach, and having a rehearsed script, will help you to step outside of yourself and to focus your attention on potential customers. You will interact more effectively and be less self-conscious.

, As any actor knows, practice makes perfect. Frequent rehearsal makes will make your pitch more familiar to you and the whole situation less frightening. Try giving your pitch in front of a mirror, use a webcam to record yourself speaking, or practice a cold call over the phone with a friend.


If you can, also ask friends to listen and make suggestions. Having an audience of real people will simulate the sales situation and ready you for the increased stress of the job.

, Shy people do well in one-on-one relationships rather than in group situations.Remember that, as a door-to-door caller, most of your interactions with be with one person, face-to-face. Use this to your advantage. If you feel a wave of anxiety, envision the situation and remind yourself that your pitch will be like having a private conversation.


The private nature of door-to-door calling should also minimize some of your fear of embarrassment. If you stumble over your words, only you and a stranger will ever know it.

, While focusing on the task at hand, sales, you might spend some time thinking about your shyness and how it affects your behavior. What makes you shy? When do you most notice it and how does it affect your interactions? Do you stumble over your words when speaking to someone of the opposite sex, for example? Is it something that you can live with or something youâd like to resolve over time?


Try making a list about situations when youâve felt embarrassed or why. Are there common factors in these situations? Think about how you might approach them in order to lessen your shyness.

, Yes, it is easier to talk about confidence than to feel confident. At the very least, try to project it to customers. Note your body language. Are you standing in an assertive posture? Do you look defeated or confident? What does your facial expression say? These are all important in projecting yourself.Stand with your legs aligned with your shoulders and feet about four to six inches apart. Distribute your body weight evenly and keep your shoulders back, turning your body toward your customer. This is an assertive â but not aggressive â posture.
Watch your hands. Avoid crossing them over your chest or putting them on your hips. Also resist playing with your hair or fiddling with objects like pens.
What about your expression? Smile and maintain eye contact. Try not to look away when the customer looks into your eye.
Try to relax, and remember to breathe!

, Approach each door with a sense of professionalism. Your charity matters. You are representing the charity. Your goal should be to show customers that the organization â and you by extension â are worthy and respectable. As with body language, you will want to create this sense of professionalism through your words and behavior. For example, speak clearly and audibly. If working from a list, address your potential customers by last name: âGood morning Mr. Johnsonâ or âHello Ms. Gonzales.â


Always greet your customers and thank them on leaving, even if they decline to contribute. Do so with a smile.

, Now is when all of your preparation comes together. Ring the doorbell, greet your potential customer, and make the pitch. If it helps, remember that you are only playing a role. Just recite your lines and follow the script.


By now you should have rehearsed your sales pitch so that you can recite it by memory: âHello, Ms. Gonzales. My name is Jeremy. Iâm raising funds for the XYZ charity, which is buying jars of pickled beets to help relieve the beet famine in Kansas. Would you like to donate? Every dollar helps!
You can keep your pitch attached to a clipboard. Even if you have memorized it, customers will not notice if you glance down at the text briefly once or twice. Consider this a backup.
Remember to thank customers graciously when they accept as well as when they decline. Then, move on to the next house.

, Great! Youâve met your customer and have given your sales pitch. Things are going well. Now is a crucial moment - you need to close the sale. Closing can be hard for shy people, because it takes a bit of confidence and brashness. However, there are some good methods for the chronically shy.


One approach is to take care of as much as possible beforehand related to the sale. Do all the paperwork for the customer, fill in all forms, and him assure that everything is already taken care of. This is called the âno hassleâ close in sales terms.Try saying something like, âIâve already filled in the paperwork. All you have to do is sign here.â The ease of the transaction may end up convincing him.

, If you are raising money for a charity, suggest to your customers how buying or contributing will lead to a greater gain elsewhere. People can often be better persuaded if they are able to see a causal connection between two events. Focus on conditional statements, i.e. âIf you contribute X, then Y will happen.â For example, âIf you contribute $20 per month, youâll give enough to feed beets to a Kansas family of four.âClosely related to the âsave-the-worldâ close is the âshameâ close. This technique makes the customer ashamed to refuse your product or charity or frames them as stingy. For instance, âAre you sure you donât want to help starving orphans?â, If you are really confident in your product, the âpuppy dogâ close may be for you. This is when you allow the customer to have a trial run. The idea is that the product is so good that the trial run closes the deal â the product in essence sells itself.This technique is also well suited to shy people, as it saves you the effort of convincing customers.


The âpuppy dogâ works by the investment principle. When people use the product or spend time with it, they associate and come to identify with it. Naturally, it works better with some products than others., Use logic and reason to convince your customers. Some people make decisions through thinking and others emotion. Try to appeal to the thinking decision maker with this closing technique. Like your sales pitch, you can even script it beforehand to practice or have outlined on your clipboard.The rational close requires you to construct an argument for the sale, often leveraging proof and science. For example, âNow, you want a carpet that wears well with your children and pets, right? Our carpet formula is scientifically proven to repel dirt and stains and to leave a fresh, pine scent. In fact, the formula is so effective that we can offer you a ten-year warranty.â

,, One final technique is the âthink-about-itâ close. This is where you offer the customer a bit of time to think over the details of the sale. Donât leave for too long, or ask how long they need. Then, when you return, look for signs that they are ready to buy. As a shy person, this technique also works without words.Say something like, âPerhaps the two of you would like to talk it over together for a few minutes?â or âI can see that youâre thinking. How about I step outside for a few minutes to let you consider?â
If the customer still needs a nudge after thinking it over, you can then take an assumptive line of questioning, i.e. âI can read your face. How many cases would you like?â

Smile and be nice.,
Ask the customer if ""they are having a good day"".,
Call for backup.,
Stop talking to coworkers when service is required.",How to Be a Good Cashier1," If you've had a bad day, leave it at home and be polite while on shift, even to the meanest customers. You don't need to be a pushover, but you're more likely to leave your customer happy and satisfied if you're slower but in a great mood than if you're the fastest cashier ever but snappy and rude. If you can't sincerely be cheerful, at least try to fake it.;
, Actually listen to their response and acknowledge their response. When they are walking out of the store, they will feel properly acknowledged and will likely come back to your store.

, If your store has a protocol to call for backup when the line gets too long, call for backup and try not to rush through the entire line yourself.

, Customers feel uncomfortable at best and disrespected if cashiers keep chatting around or over them while being served. This is your job, and just as other people don't chat away at work constantly, neither should you. Learn to drop and pick up conversations when it is appropriate.

"
"
Get to know the basics of your cash system.,
Count back change.,
Keep note of how the customer will be paying.",How to Be a Good Cashier2," Whether it's an old manual cash register or a state-of-the-art computer system, you should know how to do all the basic things that will come up at least once every three or four customers. If your cash register has quick buttons for some cash amounts, like $5 $10 $20, get in the habit of using them. For the first few days, review your basics constantly while it's not busy, and ask a more experienced cashier to double check you to make sure you're doing everything exactly right.

, When there is not a long line, get into the habit of counting back the change to the customer instead of just handing them a bunch of bills. This cuts down on mistakes.


Good practice in small retail businesses includes calling out large notes so that your coworker hears it. If there is a dispute and a customer claims to have given you more money than they did, you can use this standard practice to show that this is unlikely.

, Someone paying in cash has to search for change, while someone paying with debit needs to type their pin and wait for the transaction to go through. This is a great time to do something else they'll need done, like bagging their purchases.

"
"
Learn how to do things that come up reasonably often, but not every day.,
Know where to go for more info if something more rare comes up.,
Know the store's products well enough to make suggestions and compliments.",How to Be a Good Cashier3," For example, if you only sell a gift certificate once every week or two, it's still a good idea to know the routine by heart. It's also a good idea to know what to do if you make a mistake or a small problem comes up - what's the routine if you give the wrong change but have already closed your cash, if someone wants a refund, or if your debit machine goes on the fritz? If this wasn't part of basic training, ask your manager or a more experienced cashier.

, You probably can't memorize every routine in the book, especially the ones that might never come up while you work there, but you need to know where your guidebook or user manual is if those once-in-a-blue-moon occasions come up. It's a good idea to at least skim the full guidebook, so you'll know roughly what's in it and where to go if, say, the power goes out and you have to use that dusty manual debit card press in the back.

, Even if you're only a cashier and never expected to work the floor, you're still an employee and might be asked questions. If you happen to know something is a particularly good purchase, let the buyer know that they just got the first of a brand new product, or that you think that one's the nicest in the store and they made a great choice. Be sincere about this and don't overdo it, but a little compliment can create the perception of added value and make a customer even happier with their purchase.

Blame nobody.",How to Be a Great Salesman," You can't sell anyone anything if they don't trust you. Convincing someone that they need something you're selling requires that you balance sincerity with your desire to make the sale, being assertive, firm, and honest. If they don't trust you, they're less willing to make an intelligent buying decision.;
, Find out what your customer really wants and why they want it. People buy ""things"" as a means to an end. Understanding your customer's desires and adopting them yourself will make you a great salesman.


Allow your customer to lead interactions, and ask questions to determine their desires. If a customer says they want a suit, ask ""What's the occasion?"" Selling a suit to someone going to a funeral is a lot different than selling to someone who is celebrating a recent promotion.
If a customer expresses interest in a particular item, ask what it is they like about it. Allow them to choose the product that they feel good about, getting to know your customer and their taste, and uncovering their real motivation for buying.

, Know everything there is to know about your product, and your competitors products, so that you can justify to your customer why your recommended product is the right one for them.


If you're selling basketball shoes, learn which players wear what shoes, what styles are collectible, and some of the history of the shoes. Likewise, learn all the technical details about sizing, comfort, and care for the product.

, If you really want to be a great salesman, go the extra mile. Write down the names and contact info of your customers, and follow up with a brief call or note to make sure they are 100% happy with their purchase. This is how you turn customers into raving fans who will return to you in the future. This is how you get referrals from your customers, and promotions from your employer.

, There's no particular style--a car salesman will probably dress somewhat differently than a salesperson at a guitar shop--but you need to figure out how to look as appropriate and approachable as possible. Be clean, appropriately groomed, and friendly.

, Pay close attention to your customers reactions. Facial expressions and body language can be a big ""tell"" in the customer's attitude. As you pitch the product to them, remember that you are there to sell whatever is going to make the customer feel really good about their purchase. Guessing what part of the product or price the customer is objecting to will help you respond tactfully and persuasively.If a particular product seems to turn off a customer, acknowledge it rather than starting to argue for the product. You might objectively name some of its merits while justifying the customer's hesitation: ""It is more expensive than the others, you're right. The hand-stitching takes a lot more time to complete, but it results in much more durable shoe.""

, If you're working on commission, it can be tempting to always up-sell, or try to get customers interested in the most expensive items. But trying to up-sell a big screen plasma TV to someone living in a dorm room that isn't big enough for it is likely to put your customer off of your sales style. Balance your desire to make a sale with what product makes sense for the customer.

, If the customer is having a difficult time making the decision, it's ok to do a little pushing. Trust that you have suggested the best item and ask something like ""Would you like me to bring this up to the check out stand for you while you continue your shopping?""

, After you confirm a sale, make the case for add-ons to up your total sales. If you've just sold a printer, mention some deals you're running on ink cartridges or reams of paper. Frame it as a money and stress-saving measure for them: ""You'll need these eventually and this way you won't have to worry about it.""

, Spending lots of time on a sale that falls through can be frustrating and discouraging, but learning to put bad sales behind you and quickly approach new opportunities afresh is the best way to become a more successful salesperson.


Treat each failed sale as practice. What did you learn from it?

, Some workplaces try to stimulate sales by encouraging competition among the sales staff, posting numbers for the week or the month.While this can be a friendly way of selling enthusiastically, it can also be discouraging if you constantly compare yourself to other salespeople.


Celebrate if you do sell a lot, but don't make that your goal. Treat work as work. Fill your free time with other hobbies to avoid dwelling on making sales.

, The more sales you attempt, the easier it will go. It'll be much easier to get past small failures and little setbacks and will keep you honing your craft. If you're making calls or roving the sales floor, the day will likewise go a lot faster the more time you spend selling.

, Whatever happens, avoid placing blame anywhere. It's ultimately the customer's decision whether or not to buy something, so don't treat it as a failure on your part if they choose not to. Think of yourself as a counsellor in a transaction. Make your suggestions, be as helpful as possible, and move on when the deal is done, successful or not.

Make friends with your sales managers.",How to Be a Good Car Salesman," When a customer enters your dealership, approach them with confidence, warmth and kindness. First impression is so important and the customer needs to feel like you are being authentic with them. Meet the customer in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming or overbearing, but in a way that shows you are there to help.


The upfront approach -- walk to the customers, greet them with a firm handshake and smile, and begin asking questions about what kind of car they are looking for.
The hands off approach -- walk up to a potential customer, shake hands firmly and offer a quick greeting. Then, hand them your business card and say ""Hi my name is X, here are my contact details. My desk is over there, so take a look around and when you've found something you like or have questions come over and I can assist you. Also, if another salesperson approaches you, inform them I am assisting you."" (The problem with this approach is your customer won't likely feel any attachment to you, and so they may move on to someone else or leave the dealership with no information gained.);
, Although this can be frustrating for some customers who just want to ""get in and get out,"" striking up a conversation with customers can help build rapport and help them feel more comfortable trusting you as their salesman.


One of the biggest influences in building your customers' trust is showing them that you're not just interested in selling them a car. Show them that you want to build a relationship with them.
Ask them about their family, job, interests, etc. Find something in common with them and build trust through that connection.
People love talking about themselves, and they feel respected when they have a chance to be heard. Be so likable that your customers refer you to their friends and family.

, When talking to customers, make eye contact with them so they know that you are really interested in what they have to say. Using body language that is friendly and welcoming will also make your customer feel more at ease.


Be authentic. Don't just put on a happy face to make a sale. Actually care about your customers' needs and sympathize with them. Customers will likely be able to tell if you dislike the part of your job that involves interacting with customers, or if you're trying to speed them through ""meet and greet"" so you can start showing them cars. Be patient and don't force any decision on your customer.

, After you greet customers, make sure you give them the opportunity to share what they are looking for, or to share that they aren't sure what they want and so they just need time to look around.


Refrain from ""yes"" or "" no"" or broad questions if you don't want your customer to easily walk away. By asking ""Can I help you today?"" or ""How can I help you today?"" a customer can easily respond with ""I'm just looking, thanks"" and then you've likely lost your chance at selling a car.Try asking more directed questions like ""Are you looking for a sedan or SUV today?"" or ""what type of vehicle can I help you find today?"" Customers may still be disinterested in your help, but you have a lot better chance of keeping their attention and it will be much less awkward if you follow them around the showroom. This also allows customers to share their thoughts on the type of car they are looking for and allows you to match the needs of your customer with one of your vehicles.

, After you've figured out what type of car your customers are looking for, narrow down the search by asking them specifics about their budget, the space they require, any special features they may want.


Part of your job may be to sell them those extra features like the navigation system, heated and cooled seats, blind spot detection, extended warranty plan, etc. Selling these extra features to your customers will be much easier if you learn what they need and what they want.

, Ask customers if they have a vehicle they wish to part exchange. It's good to do this before you begin showing them new cars, because you can figure out the customers' buying motive, and will also be able to see what they feel is lacking in old car. It also allows the customer to relax when they begin looking at new cars, because they know their old car is already taken care of.Make it clear that the sales manager is the one who will appraise their car. Explain to them that the manager's job is to get them the best possible deal for their car.
After looking over the vehicle, noting any damage, and asking any questions you may have about it, take their appraisal form into your sales managers office. It should take him only a minute or so to come up with his initial offer, but inform the customer it will take about 10 minutes and use that time to begin looking at new cars.

, As you begin looking at new cars, ask customers what they are hoping to spend. You want to offer your customer the best deal while also making sure you can get the most out of the sale as well.


Ask customers what their desired monthly payment is, and work on lowering the monthly payment for your customer while extending the loan period.
Some customers will come in and refuse to talk monthly payments. They may only want to talk about the total price of the car. In that case, if you are unable to lower the price of the car in order to complete the sale, offer them extra features such as 12 months road tax at no extra cost or other features that you can add that will make the price seem more fair for the customer but won't cost you much., Tests drives are crucial for a sale, because customers need to feel comfortable in the vehicle they buy.


As you sit in the passenger seat, ask customers how they like certain aspects of the car and if the car feels different from their previous vehicle. Ask them if there are things they don't like about the functionality or feel of the car and then use those comments to find another car more fit for them.
If your customers seem pleased with the car, ask them ""Is this the car for you?"" and if the answer is yes, go on to seal the deal! If your customer still isn't sure, try suggesting other cars you think would be a good fit.

, After your customer has picked out a car and you've come to a compromise on the price, bring the price to your sales manager at an even lower price.


For example, if your customer says they can pay $200 a month, tell your manager $150 a month. This will give you more credibility with your customer and at the end of the day the important thing is that you've made a sale and have a pleased customer that may refer you to friends or will give you a high rating on your C.S.I (customer satisfaction index)., Often times your customers will bring in a white lie about what they can afford, or what the dealership down the street is planning on offering them for their trade-in. Overcome these objections by being understanding but persistent. Explain to them that your appraisal of their car is accurate and a good deal. Customers looking for a trade-in often times will value their car through Kelly Blue Book, but that value is only accurate if they can sell their car at full Kelly Blue Book retail. Every month a car loses 2% of its value, and then you have to attach all the expenses to it that make it ready to sell like tires, brakes, the noise in the back, that light that won't turn on, the safety check, and reconditioning. Also, if another customer comes in and wants to offer less for the car than what it is priced at, the dealership will likely take it because they want to make the sale, thus the customer's car is likely to bring in less than what they believe it will. Explaining this to your customers is important so they understand that you aren't gypping them in price., Now that you have discussed pricing and gotten a definite number from your manager, it's time to complete the sale. Sign the paperwork, arrange a collection date, and always stay in contact with the customer to prevent any problems.

, In order to compete with other salesman and to show your customers you are genuinely interested in the cars you are selling them, know what's on your showroom floor. Learn the cars on hand, any specials your dealership is offering, cars that may be good for people with bad credit, and anything else that could be beneficial to communicate to your customer., Study the cars other dealerships are selling, and learn why it would be more beneficial for your customer to buy from your dealership. Know every model and option your company offers as well as those of your competitors.


This will take a lot of studying, but it will be worth it because you'll know exactly why your product is better and won't have to make something up and potentially lie to your customer.

, After you meet a customer and get to know them, write down all of the information you learned in your CRM (customer relationship management). Then you'll know the best time and way to reach them.You can continue to do this until you've reached them or until they ask you to stop contacting them. Some people may get frustrated if you continue to call them, but look at it this way, those people probably weren't going to buy from you anyways so you haven't lost anything.

, These are the people that are ultimately going to help you seal the deal and they can also offer you ""house deals,"" which are about a third of the deals that take place at a dealership. If you're friendly with your manager and they trust you, they'll be able to put you on deals that are generated from the internet or from people at the dealership who know people who want to buy cars.House deals consist of ""phone-ups,"" customers who call in on the phone, or ""internet leads,"" customers who visited a website and are interested in buying a car. These are called house deals because the dealership owns them until the manager divides them up between salesmen. Sales managers play a big part in your success at the dealership. If you haven't built any relationship with them and they decide they don't like you they can starve you of deals and leave you empty handed, or give you such insufficient help that you eventually quit.

It's important to understand these before you sell. Ask your manager if you're unsure what yours are.Most state/federal law requires a customer to look at least 27+ to not be carded.
Most retailers require a customer to be/look at least 40.
Some retailers require all customers to be carded.
All customers must be at least 18 to purchase tobacco or lottery.
All customers must be at least 21 to purchase alcohol in any form.;
, Currently these are the only forms of ID that you can accept:

Any state issued ID card/driver's licenses
Current military/armed forces ID cards
Passports/passport cards
Green cards
Foreign IDs

, Take a good look at their face, hair, and etc. Look for obvious signs of age (or lack thereof): beards, wrinkles, grey hairs, etc. Try not to stare but just give them a quick once over. If they look young enough or you have to card everyone keep going., Try something like:

""May I see your ID please?
""Do you happen to have an ID that I could look at?""
""Could you take your ID out please?""
""I just need to scan/look at your ID please.""

, A common trick tried by many is to just flash it at you, or keep it in the wallet. Ask for it again or for it to be taken out. Refuse the sale if they refuse., Once you have it in your hands, give it a good once over. Again, try not to take too long. Some common things to look for include:


Date of birth. Ensure they are overage. Most times this is located on the front. Military service IDs have it located on the back.

Expiration date. Is it current? If it's expired you shouldn't accept it.

Picture/description. Consider height, eye color, and the picture. Hair style changes, people lose/gain weight, but ensure that you are looking at the same person. Kids borrow parents' or friends' cards all the time.

Evidence of tampering. Is it real? Look for variations of font color or size, flaking, lack of holographic state seals, blank backs, etc.
Optional: If you have the equipment, scan the barcode on the back. This way the system will tell you if it's real, if they're overage, and etc. You still need to make sure it's their ID if you do this, but can cut down the inspection time.

, So you don't forget, hand the card back immediately and preferably into the customer's hands, so they can't accuse you of keeping it. If your register makes you type in their birthdate, do so while it's fresh in your mind., If you have any reason to doubt the sale, refuse it. Make sure to do so politely. Try something like:

""I'm sorry. I can't accept this ID do you happen to have another on you?""
""I'm sorry. I can't sell this to you. You have to be (age) to buy this, and we could both get into a lot of trouble.""

, Some customers may yell at you or get angry for being carded or having their sale refused. Stay firm and do not give in. Explain that it's law, and/or company policy, and that you could get fined or fired if you don't comply."

Your fingers/hands will likely take an abuse so make sure you properly stretch and exercise the fingers. NOTE: most customers will not want a sticker so your next option would be to tear a few off the roll of stickers., You should always check anyway, but do not overdo this, you don't want to stress yourself out if you miss a few customers here or there, this will happen and this is normal. Some rush out the door, some stop and hand you a receipt if you ask them, and some customers are angry either way, so be careful., If you do not have one of these, just write them up. Write your initials, the date, how many items they have and you should be golden., Basically whatever you can do to keep yourself from being bored. Remember that management will be watching you and, whatever you can do to help them out will be a really big help to them, because they have a lot of responsibility, so you should treat this job as important as any other., This is by far the easiest job in the store. You have it made, and you're making money to stand around, even more overnight. Not too shabby.

Avoid losing sales because of the blame game.,
Avoid putting your own needs before those of your prospect.,
Avoid blindly following the masses, because of envy, instead of leading through customer-centric differentiation.",How to Avoid the Seven Deadly Sins of Selling," Swallow your pride. It is our need to prove to our prospects that we are smart and worthy of their respect that often leads us to losing the sale. We talk too much and listen too little. We blurt out features and benefits without first finding out if that information is relevant to our prospects. Or even worse, we neglect to find out if revealing such information will actually lessen our chances of winning the sale. The key is to assume less, pitch less, and ask more questions. Fact finding is the first step on a sales call; you can't make a recommendation if you don't know what the customer needs. You should ask questions such as: How much is an average customer worth? What is your 5 year business plan?;
, Setting up a system helps salespeople fight against laziness also known as the deadly sin of sloth - and keeps us from drifting into bad habits that will inhibit our sales performance. You should be looking to automate your sales process as much as possible so that you can save yourself time, money and effort. And we don't just mean automate with computers or other technologies. We mean that you must work on developing systems habits, scripts, typical questions that have proven to be effective in any given situation. It doesn't matter what system you use, just make sure you are using one and monitoring the success it brings you. Your main goal as a salesperson is to find what works as fast as possible and then keep repeating it time after time to reach extraordinary sales goals.

, Building trust and lowering your prospect's resistance to change are the biggest challenges you will face early on in the sales process. For any number of reasons, your prospects fear doing business with you or any other salesperson. Therefore, what you need to do is slowly build trust and rapport with your prospects. By building trust slowly, you are avoiding the deadly sin of gluttony. Don't go in trying to win the big deal without first building credibility. There is an old saying that in order to eat an elephant you must do it small bit by small bit. The same applies in sales. Those salespeople who try to win small pieces of business and then build incrementally end up with a much greater portion of their customers' share of wallet. Even more striking is that those that use this strategy manage to break into many more accounts than those who simply try to go out and bite off more than their prospects will allow them to chew.

, While many marketing and advertising executives are seeking the instant gratification (i.e. lust) of highly creative, flashy campaigns, salespeople are looking for substantive strategies that sell. There is an old saying that goes: sell the steak, not the sizzle. For our purposes here, think of the ""sizzle"" as the sexy features of your product/service and the ""steak"" as the solid benefits. If you are selling features, you are probably going to end up dead in the water. What you must do is sell benefits that are relevant to the prospect sitting across the table from you.

, Anger often rears its ugly head when reality does not meet one's expectations. Many salespeople, especially early in their careers, are discouraged by:
the amount of work it takes to succeed in sales;
the amount of rejection that one must endure; and
the many factors that are outside of one's control as a salesperson.

Although there are many factors that a salesperson cannot control, one very powerful factor that they have total control over is their attitude. Combat the damaging effects of anger by keeping a realistic yet positive attitude.

, Greed drives salespeople to:
rush the prospect to buy instead of taking the time to build rapport and create trust first;
sell products/services that do not solve their prospects' and customers' problems; and,
at best, make one sale but lose potential future sales by ruining their reputation with the customer.

To avoid greed, you must not only become a true trusted advisor to your clients but also, and perhaps more importantly, understand how to create the perception that you are their trusted advisor.

, The reason why most sales training programs fail is that they are focused on tactical tools rather than strategic frameworks. Tactics are essential; however, typically, where most sales courses, books and tapes fall short is in tying their tactics together into an overall flexible strategy. No one can tell you exactly what notes to play, but you can get the sheet music that you can interpret and play based on what sounds right for you given your own unique style and what sounds right for your buyer, given any situation that confronts you. Differentiate yourself by focusing on the specific needs of your customers.

If there is no supervisor available, explain the policy.,
Remember the consequences.,
Look out for the Proxy Sales!,
Remember: At the end of the day, you are in charge of how you do your job.",How to Ask a Customer for Identification In the UK," If you get a chance, remind customers of the policy. If there is no one waiting to be served at the till, try to get a moment to observe your alcohol aisle. If there is anyone browsing the alcohol, and appears to look under 25, approach them and politely remind them of the policy. Either they have their ID with them, They know the policy, or won't have any ID and will have to come back later with some.;
, Don't automatically assume the person is underage and embark on shouting their face off, this just begs for verbal abuse and rarely, assault. Treat the buyer like anyone else, when it comes to purchasing the age related product kindly ask for an acceptable form of identification.

, If they do have Identification, carefully analyze their proof of age, the different acceptable ID's are as follows:


Provisional or Full Driving License
Passport
Citizen Card
Any other form of ID with a holographic PASS logo

, Any other form of ID will not be acceptable. If they produce an unacceptable form of ID, or if their ID is fake, defaced or forged, decline the sale and ask for a real ID, remember to keep your cool!

, In the case that the customer has no real ID on their persons, politely inform them that you cannot sell them the product because of the policy. If the customer begins to make excuses or tries to intimidate you DO NOT ALLOW THE SALE. Doing so is illegal and can land you in a lot of trouble.

, If you feel you are being abused by the customer, get help. Sometimes the customer will cuss and argue with you because of the refused sale. If in any way you feel like your being abused call for help from a supervisor.

, If you find yourself alone and in a position where you need to explain why the sale is refused, calmly remind the customer of the policy in place. If they continue to get abusive, you have full right to ask them to leave the premises, but only use this if you are really under a lot of fire from the customer.


If they don't leave, call the cops. In the most rarest of cases their might be a customer who will refuse to leave until they get what they came for, it is now time to inform the local authorities of this, and ask for help. With any luck the customer will be removed from the premises.

, Of course, getting through a work day upholding the policy can be a real pain, but neglecting the policy can lead to MUCH deeper trouble which includes:


On the spot fine of Â£5000
Removal of license to sell age related products
Shutdown of the outlet by Trading Standards
Loss of employment
Possible prison sentence

, These are sales intended to purchase age restricted products under age or to purchase for underage groups, look out for them:


Loose change when buying cheap alcohol or cigarettes is a dead giveaway.
Look out for youths loitering outside, they may ask customers to go in and purchase age restricted products for themselves.
If a customer walks in and buys a product that a refused customer tried to purchase, ask them if they are buying it for themselves. But this is only applicable to instantly after the refused person leaves, not an hour later.
If a customer does an unusual amount of thinking, or asks odd questions such as 'Whats the cheapest alcohol/cigarettes you got? This may be an obvious proxy sale.

, Always keep your wits about you in the employee world. One slip can lead to many different problems which may affect not just you, but others as well.

Customers want to buy from people who know more about products than they do. Your goal as the salesperson is to let the customer know how they could easily make the product they want better, which means you have to know that product inside and out. Do your homework to make the upsell.


If you work at a bookstore with a large selection of fantasy books, it'd be a good idea to read the big hits in the genre if you want to make sales in that section. If you think Gandalf was the best character in the Goblet of Fire you're not going to be a very convincing seller of fantasy books.;
, A good salesperson will be able to quickly give customers a read and tailor their sales technique to the individual. Whether you're in wholesale or retail, a salesperson needs to let the customer's desires drive the sale.



In a retail setting, try to distinguish between browsing customers who are unlikely to buy things and customers who seem to be actively looking for an item. If a customer seems to be browsing without aim, make contact and ask if you can be of assistance. Listen actively before attempting to upsell them right off the bat with an expensive feature item. If a customer seems to be shopping actively, start thinking of an upselling strategy based on their purchases or interests.If you're selling wholesale, try to get a sense of the customer's needs by asking lots of questions. Why is the customer buying so many plastic cups? What else might you be able provide them to make that goal easier and more convenient?

, Talk to the customer by making friendly contact, greeting them, and making yourself available for questions and assistance. Find out what it is your customer wants and use that desire to begin the process of making the sale.


If your bookstore customer is browsing interestedly through the Chronicles of Narnia, start your contact by complimenting their taste: ""What a great series--which have you read?"" Listen to them and engage in friendly conversation if the customer seems up for it. Bring up other series they might be interested in, like the Spiderwick Chronicles or the Lord of the Rings.

, One of the most-complained about aspects of aggressive sales is the ubiquitous ""random"" upsell. It's one thing to offer additional related purchases (LOTR, bookmarks, etc.) in a friendly way at the counter, but making automatic attempts at selling the customer on the highest-end product without listening to their interests is likely to turn lots of customers off.


If you approach the Narnia customer and try to sell them on the new Steve Jobs biography in hardback, which the store's running a sale on because of a big back-stock, it's likely to confound and irritate because it's a transparent upsell. Customers aren't stupid.
Lay the seed of an upsell by providing a variety of other purchase options and let the customer decide. Make your suggestions related and of benefit to the customer, not of benefit to your bottom line., The price of the item you're going to try to upsell shouldn't come into play until you've already made the case for the item. Connect the most appropriate selection to the customer's desire and let them consider the price on their own.


Likewise, many salespeople hesitate to make suggestions to a customer already carrying an armload of merchandise, fearing that the bill will freak the customer out. Not your problem. Be honest and provide the most valuable options for the customer, as you see it, and let them decide.

, The surest upsell is to offer additional related items for something a customer is already purchasing. If the customer is buying the first book in the Narnia series, suggest the second as well: ""When you finish that, trust me, you're going to want to start right in on the second. I could hardly wait!"" You might also suggest things like bookmarks, or other related items.


Consider the things you would want if you were the customer making this purchase - if you bought a camera, you would want to buy an extra battery, a case to carry it in, extra flash card and a card reader so you could get your pictures off to your computer, all the things necessary to create the best possible experience with the product.
In a wholesale setting, try to find out everything you can about the customer's business and offer other related products. Appeal to most wholesalers desire to simplify and give them the option to get everything they need from one place--your place.

, Not all products are equal, and especially in the sale of higher-end items, it's good to guide the customer through different features, highlighting the benefits of more-expensive items. Even with books, you might consider selling the Narnia customer on the full box-set of books, with detailed pictures and maps in a handsome box.


Make it practical for the customer. If you're trying to sell a college student on a computer, they're likely interested in something with a good video card, something durable and lightweight, something with a good warranty. An expensive, but on-sale desktop with a super-high amount of RAM probably isn't a smart upsell, even if the features are, in your opinion, ""better"" if the customer clearly wants a laptop.
In a wholesale setting, you might consider different size orders that would give the customer the same product at a better deal. Bulk items generally come with a benefit, so it's a good idea to highlight the long-term price benefit in making the bigger buy now instead of waiting to come back for more.

, What's the difference between the paperback Narnia and the three-times as expensive hardback edition? The story's the same, right? Of what benefit is the ""fancier"" more high-quality version of the same product. It may have to do with features, but quality really has more to do with prestige. Selling quality means selling durability, craftsmanship, and style:


""This is a book you're going to want to hang on to, probably read again. That paperback's going to fall apart, which is why it's so cheap, and the words are so close together it'd give me a headache. I'd go for this copy, myself. The illustrations are so beautiful, and it looks so great on the shelf.""

, Highlight at least three price ranges of options for the customer trying to make a decision. On their own, a customer will likely go for the option they perceive to have the most value. Without understanding the features, however, this likely means that the customer will go for the cheapest option. If you make a good case for all the options, you've at least given them the opportunity to make a more informed choice, which means they're likely to spend a bit more because you've helped them become more informed.


Highlight the features, don't highlight the price. Make the most attractive thing in the transaction some aspect of the item, not the difference in the price tag.

, In a retail setting, put the item in the customer's hand. Pick the items up and hand them to the customer, letting them feel, examine, and enjoy while you describe the features and the benefits of making the additional purchase. Once something is in hand, it's a lot harder psychologically for the customer to walk out without anything.


In a phone sale, clearly distinguish between different options to make it easier on the customer. Listen to their questions and help to distinguish between the different levels of quality, offering friendly advice to get them the best deal. Description will make the sale.

, One of the best moments is when your customer not only returns to your place of business to shop again, but wants to find you to sell to them again, specifically. Doing everything in your power to ensure repeat business and gain a long-term customer is one of the best kinds of upselling you can do, no matter what your line of sales. If your customer perceives what you're doing as a favor, they're much more likely to return to the place where they're ""treated right.""


One of the best ways to do your customer a favor is, surprisingly, to steer them toward a cheaper--but not the cheapest--option. There's nothing more convincing than lowering your voice and saying, ""Now, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but this brand is so overpriced, it's ridiculous. This other option gets you the same features and you're sacrificing none of the quality, in my opinion. This is what I use at home.""

, Customers are likely to have lots of knee-jerk responses to the idea of spending more money. To close the deal, take the initiative to make the sale happen quickly before they think too much. If you've sold the Narnia-reader on the first LOTR book as well, offer to ring up the purchases while she continues browsing. Hold the items up front, ready to go.

, This is the single most important part of this selling method. It is very important that you reinforce your customer's purchase at the end of the sale, making it sound like it was all their decision and thinking. Saying something like, ""Great choices today, I think you're going to be really happy with this. Come back soon and let me know what you think of it!""


Make yourself available by providing a business card and contact info so your customer can get in touch directly, or at least give them a company card and write your name on the back of it. Best case scenario, you'll form a bond with your customer and possibly win a patron.

, It's a common myth that extroverts are more effective salespeople than introverts, while studies show that, in truth, both are equally ineffective.The best salespeople are versatile, with the ability to tailor their personality and style to the customer's preferred method of interaction. Look to make connections with a customer based on genuine interaction, coming from a place of your expertise with the product, and your empathy with the customer's desires.


You must feel genuine excitement and enthusiasm for a customer's purchases. It's okay to repeat or rephrase some of your conversation during the sale, but avoid parroting the same lines and giving the impression that you're reading from a script. Be genuine and be honest, and you'll consistently be able to upsell.

Your broker must also file paperwork to act as your sponsor. Your broker should already know how to file this paperwork, as she should do it on a regular basis. Once your sponsorship paperwork has been mailed and accepted, you will be licensed as a real estate agent in Texas.

Come prepared.,
Know why you're there: to get names on your page.,
Stand in front of the table.,
Chat with the vendors around you - and then sell them.,
Have a grab line.,
Say your grab line over and over, and don't stop until someone stops at your table.,
Set a numeric goal and make sure you hit it.,
""Rap"" for success.,
Your Action should always include telling your person to put their name on the page.,
Follow up quickly, or you may lose all your hard work!,
Have fun!",How to Be a Vendor at a Convention," This means three things:


Have something attractive to draw people to your table. This could be a clever / shocking / attractive sign, a large picture, or big, bold text. Posters and tri-fold pieces of poster board are very common. This is actually the LEAST important part of coming prepared - but it really does help!
Know what you're going to say ahead of time. If you make up your ""rap"" (elevator speech) on the spot, people will be confused and they won't pay you much attention.
Have some way to record name and contact info for everyone who stops by! Your goal is to recruit, so make sure you're not taking anyone's word for it - you have to have a way to follow up! Lined paper will work, though a more standard signup sheet with lines is nice. ALWAYS HAVE PENS.;
, Some people will tell you that simply going to a convention to ""get the company name / cause out there"" is enough. This is pure, unadulterated BS. If you spend (usually hundreds of) your organization's dollars for a space, and then sit there - you're wasting time and resources, not least your own.

, Do not sit. Do not stand behind and lean over. Stand in front, where you can stop people or follow them without feeling awkward, and where you can keep energized and on your toes. This is a friendly contact sport, and you should be limber. I like to dance (badly) to keep my energy and courage up. Do whatever works for you!

, They'll probably be sitting still and bored, and you'll brighten their day. While you're chatting, hit them up with your rap! I like to circle the room and sign up all the vendors first. They're sympathetic, they can't move, and it's great practice to get you started.

, You'll need a ""grab line"" to attract people so you can do your rap. Grab lines are just what they sound like - they capture your attention. ""Here, check out an interest-free credit card!"" and ""Hey, I need your help to save mass transit in Detroit"" are both good grab lines. They demand - instead of asking for - the person's attention, while doing it in a polite, upbeat way! A bad grab line would be your entire rap... or a timid, ""hey, you got a second?"" Never ask a question to which your customer can answer ""no.""

, If it's possible to say it to every person, do it. If it's more natural to say it to every third person, do that. Just make sure there's no pause between one person and the next. Sound confident instead of desperate. Approach each new person as if they're your first, but don't stop. It's not awkward to approach two people in a row. It's awkward to get rejected, stop, and not be able to start again for ten minutes. Just remember it's a numbers game! Most people will say no or ignore you. Every tenth person will stop (even more will stop as you get more confident), and that one in ten people is what you need to hit your goal!

, Don't let yourself say ""whatever I get is icing on the cake."" That will leave you unmotivated and lethargic. Break it down into hours, as in ""I'm here for five hours, I need a hundred people - that's twenty people per hour.""

, The rap is the most important factor in getting names on the page - not the ""quality"" of the crowd, not apathy, and not your personal charisma. Not even the quality of your product is as important! It all comes down to what you say; humans are very predictable creatures and they respond to predictable things. There is an easy formula for a persuasive speech - learn it, practice it and use it to succeed! It goes:


Introduction (who am I?)
Legitimization (what gives me a right to talk to you?)
Problem (what issue am I trying to solve by selling you this thing / getting you to sign up?)
Solution (what does the product or campaign accomplish? What are the goals?)
Action (what can you, the customer / activist, do RIGHT NOW to keep up with the product, buy today or advance the cause?)

, Again, you're telling, not asking. That doesn't mean being overbearing. It means being ""assumptive"" with your ask. As in, ""I understand you don't have the cash to buy one of these / don't have the time to write a letter to your Congressman today. I can see you're interested / you support our cause though, which is awesome. Here, put your name down, and we'll put you on our Alert Network in case something happens in your neighborhood!""

, Whether you're selling products or getting someone active in a campaign, there is about a 48-hour window in which the person will remember you and remember that they signed up at your table. Tons of scientific studies say that once people have said yes once, they're much more likely to say yes again - meaning, if they remember you, they're very likely to come to your meeting or buy your product when you follow up. If you wait more than 48 hours, you lose this advantage.

, Tabling is conducting a crowd, building your business or campaign, and meeting new and interesting people. If you do it right, you'll feel powerful and energized - and you'll undoubtedly impress your boss!

Check out the company on the Providers Association website.,
Never accept a check from a company before you complete the work.,
Never pay a hiring fee.,
Contact the hiring companies directly.,
Prepare your documentation.,
Register with a mystery shopping company.,
Wait for approval of your application.,
Remember you are providing stores with valuable information about their customer service.,
Be aware you will work flexible hours.,
Understand how you will get paid by the company.",How to Apply to Be a Mystery Shopper," The MSPA (Mystery Shoppers Providers Association) has a large database of reputable companies, free of charge.They work to deter scammers and keep a running list of scam sites.
The MSPA offers training and resources for mystery shoppers, for a fee.You can become a member of the MSPA and have access to networking information and other benefits.;
, The MSPA recommends refusing payment from a company that offers you a check without asking you to complete an assignment. This is likely a scam.The scam promoter or company may send you a check with instructions to deposit it in a personal bank account. They will then tell you to withdraw the amount in cash, and wire it to a third party. But the check is fake and the person who deposited the check (you) will then be responsible for paying back the bank.
Some scammers will use the MSPA logo in their emails or letters to appear more legitimate. It's always best to be suspicious if the company sends you a check before you complete the work, even if their email or letter has an MSPA logo., Dishonest companies use newspaper ads and emails to give you the impression mystery shopper jobs are the first step to higher-paying jobs. They may tell you that you need to register or get certified to be a mystery shopper. But it is not necessary to pay anyone to get into the mystery shopping business.Once you pay the âhiring feeâ, you likely wonât get a refund from the promoters or a position at a company.

, Donât just go to their website and take a quick look around, or answer an email from a so-called shopper service and wait to get hired. Call the company through a listed number on their website, or locate them by googling their name. Look at the address and contact information listed on their website or on google pages to make sure they have a physical office.Contacting them allows you to confirm they are a legitimate company and can offer you a real position as a mystery shopper.

, You will need basic information about yourself. You will also need official documentation like your social security number.


Always be wary of scam sites and never give out your SSN if you feel uncomfortable with the site. Companies usually offer a fax in or mail in option for the application if you do not want to give this information out online.
Some applications may ask if you have a credit card you can use for purchases in the store during your shift. But, if the company is legitimate, you should not have to give out your credit card number.

, Make sure there is no fee for registering with the company.


By registering, you become an independent contractor for the company. Once you have registered, the company will look over your application. They will then contact you directly with possible mystery shopping jobs. You are required to fill out an application with information such as:Name, address, home phone, email.
The distance you are willing to travel to reach a job.
Languages spoken fluently.
Any other mystery shopping companies you have worked for.
Date of birth, background, ethnicity and education.
Some applications may need your social security number.

, Once you become an approved shopper, the company will email you with your shopper ID. You will also be given access to a database with possible jobs in your area.After you choose which shops you are interested in, you can choose from a range of dates to perform the shop.
Keep in mind accepting the shop means you are committed to completing the shop during the specified time frame.

, As a mystery shopper, you will pose as an ordinary customer. You will then evaluate the businessâ service, cleanliness, quality and efficiency when helping customers.You must also be at least 18 years of age.
You will receive complete guidelines for each shop where you complete a job. It is your responsibility to uphold the guidelines. You must also fulfill all the expectations of a mystery shopper at a certain store or shop.
Itâs important to demonstrate excellent observational skills and be detail oriented. You need to be able to watch the store and the employees as you shop, without making it obvious that you are a secret shopper.

, Reputable companies will hire you as an independent contractor, not an employee. This means you can choose your assignments according to your schedule and take as many jobs as youâd like.So you can squeeze in a mystery shop during your lunch break or commit several hours a week to mystery shopping.The average shop time is between 1 and 2 hours.

, A reputable company will pay you once you write a quality report for the shop, based on your experience as a mystery shopper.The usual rate varies from $5 to $20 a shop.Some mystery shops will ask you to buy a meal or a sale item. The company will reimburse you for these costs.

Choose your location wisely.",How to Become a Realtor," You will need to have one of these certifications and be at least 18 years of age before becoming a real estate agent. , Requirements, laws, rules, and regulations for real state agents vary between states.


In California, you must be at least 18 years of age and provide documentation that shows you are a legal resident of the United States. Applicants must complete the following educational requirements before passing the real estate examination: three real estate courses that have been approved by the Department of Real Estate, and two years working as a real estate salesperson.

Applications for certification must be completed within two years of passing the real estate exam.The state of Colorado recognizes three different kinds of real estate licenses: the Associate Broker license, Independent (self-employed) Broker license, and the Employing Broker license. The requirements for each type of license vary. Applicants who are licensed in other states may be exempt from certain requirements., Regardless of what state you live in, you will have to obtain a license in order to practice as a real estate agent. Complete all of the educational, work, and exam requirements before applying for certification in your state.


You don't necessarily have to be a resident of a certain state in order to practice real estate there.Be sure to keep your real estate license current. Some states require that you complete over 20 hours of continuing education courses during your licensure period. , Check listings in your area for openings at real estate companies.

Be dependable.,
Present yourself well.,
Take care to understand the store policies thoroughly.,
Get along with your coworkers.,
Work with management, not for them.,
Provide a great customer experience.,
Be a professional when it comes to the more challenging customers.,
Know the store and the products you are selling.,
Train often.,
Help maintain the store.,
Have fun.",How to Excel in a Retail Job," Try your best to arrive at work on time, ideally allowing enough time for traffic (whether you drive or take public transportation) and any unexpected delays as well. It's a good idea to arrive at least 10 minutes before your shift is scheduled to start. This way, you can ease into the workday and have a little time to prepare before going out on the sales floor.


If you are habitually late you will be leaving your coworkers in a lurch. You also risk facing disciplinary action or even dismissal, depending on the jurisdiction in which you work.
If you can't make work because you're ill or indisposed for a good reason, alert your workplace as early as you can. This allows them to make alternative arrangements to cover your shift. Equally, if you want to get ahead in the job, making it known that you're available to fill in at short notice can be a great way to get noticed, make more money and be seen as highly reliable.





;
, Retail work is very visual, and it includes not only the stock, but those selling the stock too. Smart grooming and good clothing are an important part of presenting a professional image that inspires confidence in anyone dealing with you. Make an effort, even if your natural preference is scruffy and comfortable. Good presentation can also provide you with a professional ""shield"" between you and customers, giving you the confidence to behave more professionally.


If the store requires a uniform of some sort, keep it well laundered and pressed (find out if the company covers such costs).
Have a comb or brush handy for touching up hair during the shift, and perhaps a small mirror and some makeup for touch-ups.







, If you have any questions about what is and is not allowed, ask before doing or failing to do something, or you risk not following the store policies. Many stores give training at the commencement of your job but changes occur over time, so be sure to keep up to date with store policy changes the longer you stay there.


For example, you might want to take home used boxes from the store for your volunteer work of doing art with street kids. However, your store might have a policy that employees take nothing from the store; you'd need to know this beforehand, or risk being dismissed.

, Aim to be friendly, polite, flexible, and sympathetic to the needs of those you work with. Successfully developing a rapport with your coworkers will ensure that they trust you, can easily work with you, and can count on you. Plus, enjoying the company of the people you work with will make any slow day go by a lot faster.


What about those times when a coworker wants to chat endlessly? Realize how bad this looks to customers, and how it can cause customers to shy away from asking for your help or service. Ask your coworker to keep the chatting to times when customers are not directly affected; if your coworker seems to keep chatting, it can help to ignore any attempts to engage you in conversation when it's not convenient.
Seasonal events can stress everyone in your team, when there are many shoppers, stock is strewn everywhere and you're constantly stuck at the cashier's spot. On such occasions, give each other pep talk, offer a word of praise now and then, and keep an eye out for coworkers who miss breaks and offer to cover for them so that they can take them to refresh.
Sometimes coworkers will behave negatively. On such occasions, be aware that workplace conflict is a natural part of working with others and is something to manage, not run from. Try to handle things yourself initially but if it's too difficult or involves serious issues such as harassment, seek immediate help from your supervisors/superiors.
There may be times when one or more members of your team fails to take the role seriously. Realize that everyone has down days or feels fed up with what they're doing. It's not usually about you, so don't take their behavior to heart. Ask them ""What's up?"" and be compassionate about their issues.

, Get to know your boss (for example, the store manager) and any other authority figures (for example, assistant managers, sales managers, department managers, etc.). Know what each of your superiors expects of you in your position.


Aim to be flexible. This includes keeping an open mind if you're asked by management to stay late during the busy holiday season or to take on an extra responsibility. If you execute this well enough, your efforts will be recognized and you are likely to receive some kind of benefits in the long run, perhaps even a promotion.
Ask questions. Whether it's because you don't know something or because you'd like to try something innovative but you're not sure how it'd go down, asking questions shows engagement with the job and interest in it.

, Greet each customer and find out what they've come into the store for by asking open-ended questions. Guide them to the product (if available) and assist them with answering any questions they might have. Then, offer to help them find anything else they could be looking for, or if applicable, if they would be interested in a warranty plan (cross-sell!).


Smile and stay upbeat even when the customer doesn't smile back. Customers do notice your smile, they may simply be too busy, self-absorbed in thoughts about what they have to do next or a shrinking violet. Your pleasantness may be enough to thaw the ice for the next person that customer meets!






Be aware that disengagement from or lack of enthusiasm for your job is apparent to allââto your coworkers, your boss... and yes, your customers. And customers are super ready to judge that a disengaged retail worker is likely to not want to help them, setting up a defensive situation from the start. Even if this job isn't your dream ticket to a future career, stay professional; it's good training for any future job. And you never know when your next customer might be a source of information or work opportunitiesââor simply interesting!

, Clearly not all customers are pleasant and some are downright surly or difficult, especially when waiting in long queues or holding unrealistic expectations about what your store can offer them. In such cases, don't take their ranting or negativity personally. Realize that some people will be mean-spirited no matter what you do or say and that some people are simply out to make trouble, for whatever reason.


Be aware that often the more challenging customer has underlying emotional issues, such as anxiety about overspending, anger about something totally unrelated to the store/sale (and you're sadly an easy victim), a sense of entitlement, etc. It is not personal (which is probably why it hurts even more, as you feel treated like an automaton). Whatever the cause, stay calm and polite, and if you feel you're over your head, call for your supervisor.
Debrief whenever a customer has been especially difficult. Whether it's encouraged by your workplace culture or not, find at least one team member with whom you can talk through difficult experiences. If your workplace doesn't already have such an opportunity in place, suggest that learning sessions be implemented to help all of you learn how to better deal with difficult situations in a more professional and constructive manner. Nobody is born knowing how to solve all conflict, and such skill-building should be part of your workplace training.

, Familiarize yourself with the sales floor layout and which merchandise is located where. Research as much as you can about the products the store/your department sells, and what advantages your store or the products you sell offer over similar stores or competing products. This way, when it's time to sell a product or service to a customer, you'll be well-informed and can confidently close the sale.

, Almost all retail stores provide some kind of basic training to new associates, typically outlining the proper procedures of your position and how to handle common customer scenarios. You can never learn too much, either, so feel free to ask management what training options you may have available if you need a refresher.

, Even if your role is not in logistics coordination, you can make sure that shelves are neat, items are in their correct places, there are no messes or potential hazards around, and that employee areas are safe and adequately stocked.


Demonstrate to others how important it is to pick up stock on the floor, rearrange messy stock etc., by simply pitching in and fixing it whenever the need is apparent. You don't need directions from above to keep the store neat.

, Most importantly, enjoy what you do and learn from the experience. You never know who you'll meet and what opportunities your job will bring in the future.

Then find where local or on-line schools are that give classes for your trainee license. It is possible to begin getting appraisal experience before getting a license in some states; California is one of them.;
, This is usually done by taking classes and passing a test, and/or having some experience in appraisal work. (Each state has their own criteria in obtaining this license - check with them).

, After getting your trainee license, you'll need a 'supervising' appraiser to teach you the tricks of the trade and to help you attain the experience hours that you will need. Be aware that you may need two or more 'supervising' appraisers to help you on your journey. Work with a supervising appraiser who lives near you, as you'll have to spend time with this person in actual 'hands on' experience. Finding a supervising appraiser to help you will be the toughest part of the job, but it will be worth it. You'll need a supervisor to sign all of your work as a trainee. You can also find a supervising appraiser before getting your trainee license, like a friend or relative who is already a working appraiser.

, This is one of the best ways to see if you really like appraising and to find out what appraising is all about.

, Banks and savings and loans of all sizes hire trainee appraisers who have obtained their trainee licenses right off the street. It's a great way to get paid and get an education at the same time.

, Do what you can to work with (or for) experienced appraisers in your area. Give them an incentive to hire you.

, Since most of appraisals are done for bank loans, it will serve you well to find the people giving the loans and talk with them. A good relationship with a loan broker will go a long way.

Although some schools have âpre-lawâ majors or concentrations, law schools do not require any particular major. Find a subject that interests you and in which you can do well.

Make sure you attend an accredited undergraduate college or university. To check, visit the U.S. Department of Educationâs (âDOEâ) Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs.;
, The ability to speak with anyone is a great skill for a lawyer, including real estate lawyers. Real estate lawyers meet with a variety of people during their workday, from clients, potential clients, opposing counsel, and even judges or arbitrators. You need to be comfortable speaking to diverse constituencies, often off the top of your head.


While in college, look for opportunities to engage in public speaking. These opportunities can be in debate clubs, public speaking competitions, or even acting as a tour guide for the school.
Also look for opportunities to strengthen your research and writing skills. Sign up for upper-level electives that allow you to write long research papers.

, Law school admissions is basically a numbers game, and the two most important numbers are your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and your score on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). To make the strongest admissions case possible, you should try to get the highest grades possible. Admissions committees view a high GPA as an indication that you are motivated and work hard.To get into an accredited law school, you will need a GPA around 3.0 or higher. Applicants admitted into the Top 50 schools generally have a GPA of at least a 3.5.

, Another key element of your application will be letters of recommendations from professors who know you. To get strong letters of recommendation, you should try to work with faculty as a research or teaching assistant. This experience will allow professor to write detailed letters of recommendation in support of your admission to law school.

, You can get an early taste of the life of a real estate lawyer while in college. Intern or work part-time for a real estate lawyer. Many lawyers and law firms need clerical and support staff assistance in the summer but also throughout the year.


Itâs never too early to begin building your network. If you do a good job working for a real estate attorney in college, then when you graduate law school you can revive the relationship and potentially get a job.

, The LSAT is offered four times a year, in June, September, December, and February. It is offered on Saturdays. There are special sessions for those who observe a Saturday Sabbath.Create a free account at the Law School Admission Counselâs (âLSACâ) website.
Find a test date and location. To do this, start on LSACâs Law School Admission Counselâs website Dates and Deadlines page. The last date to take the exam for fall admissions is typically September/October. You may be able to take the December or February test, but by then many law schools will already have filled most of their classes.

, The LSAT is probably the most important factor in your law school application, so take it seriously. It tests reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.Test prep companies offer tutoring, but you can also study on your own.


Your local library or bookstore should have copies of old LSAT exams. Find the most recent to take as practice exams.
The LSAT is scored on a scale from 120-180, with 180 being the highest. To get into an accredited law school, try to get a score around the fiftieth percentile, which is around a 152., The LSAT comprises five multiple choice sections and one unscored essay. Four of the five multiple choice sections count toward your score. The fifth is experimental and does not count toward your score. You will not know in advance which section is experimental.

Read up ahead of time on the test rules so that you can follow them to the letter. Failure to follow the rules could disqualify you from taking the test. A complete set of test day rules can be found on the LSACâs website on its Day of the test webpage.

, You can take the LSAT more than once. Schools may choose to accept your higher score, or they may choose to average the two. You have to pay each time you take the test.


On average, test takers are able to increase their score only two to three points on a re-take.You may not want to retake the test unless your score was far below what you were scoring on practice exams.

, All law schools use CAS. You will send them your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluation. CAS then creates a packet that it sends to each law school you apply to. The service requires a fee.Make sure to get all documents to CAS in a timely manner. A law school will not move on your application until it has your packet from CAS.

, Ask early. Sometimes professor agree but then forget as they get busy. Only ask professors who you are sure can write a positive letter of recommendation and do not press if faculty are hesitant. A hesitant professor might write a weak letter of recommendation.


Also think of getting letters from employers. If you worked part-time for a real estate attorney, then a detailed letter from your employer could help your application as well.
Some recommenders may need to be prompted to complete the letter. Send a friendly email reminder, or stop in to chat.

, Law schools require that you write a short (about 500 word) statement, on a topic of your own choosing.You want your personal statement to be engaging, free of errors, and brief.


Follow the directions. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. Also, if they give you a word limit, stick to the limit. Going over, by even a few words, can harm your chances of admission.
Feel free to write about your interest in real estate law. However, itâs a good idea to only write on the subject if you have something meaningful to say. The best personal statements are often based on anecdotes, so write about real estate law if you have some experience with it.

, An addendum can help explain something that looks bad in your application. It provides context for any information that might raise âred flagsâ in the eyes of the Admissions Committee members.Red flags include criminal convictions, punishment for cheating or plagiarism, or semesters with very low grades. An addendum might also clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another. Remember to explain in your addendum, not make excuses.
Your addendum does not need to be lengthy. For example, you could simply state, âI would like to explain why my first LSAT score is 20 points lower than my second. Two days before the first exam, I contracted the flu. Since I was afraid that cancelling would result in my not being able to apply to law school this year, I went ahead and took the exam although I was sick. During the second exam, I felt much better and scored closer to my averages on practice exams.â

, You can gauge your likelihood of gaining admission to specific schools by using the LSAC calculator. Enter your undergraduate GPA and LSAT score to see your chances at any ABA-accredited law school.


If you have a 3.5 GPA and a 155 LSAT, then you have an 80% chance of getting into Brooklyn Law School but only a 50% chance of getting into Pittsburgh Law School.

, Unless you attend a top 20 school, you most likely will be practicing in the area where you attended law school. Most law schools place their alumni in the local legal community. Accordingly, you should pay attention to the schoolâs location and make sure you feel comfortable living there.


You should always ask any prospective law school for its job placement statistics. Pay attention to the number of students who get âfull-time jobs requiring a JDâ after graduation. This is the most relevant statistic. Other statistics, such as âthose working full-time,â might include people who are working full-time in a job that doesnât require a law degree.

, As you compare law schools, you should always pay attention to costs. Law school tuition now exceeds $40,000 a year at many private law schools.Factoring in living expenses, you could be borrowing close to $200,000 to complete a three-year degree.


Tuition for out-of-state law students is often comparable to the tuition of a private school. If you want to move to a state and hope to qualify as an in-state resident, contact the law schoolâs admissions office for information.

, A great way to get hands-on legal experience while in law school is to participate in a clinic. Many law schools have clinics where students represent low-income clients while under the supervision of a faculty member. Some law schools offer real estate clinics or have real estate institutes. These schools include Brooklyn Law School and John Marshall Law School.In a real estate clinic, students may represent low-income cooperative boards or other non-profits. Students will assist with loan and co-op unit closings, shareholder meetings, and drafting by-law or lease amendments., The basic curriculum for first year students is pretty much the same at any law school, but after the first year, the classes available might be very different. Many law schools offer a real estate focus or certificate. These schools will offer many upper-level electives in areas such as Land Use Regulation, Basic and Advanced Real Estate, Construction Law, and Municipal Law., Applying to more than one school increases your chances of being accepted. If you donât get into any school, then you will have to wait a year before applying.
, Unless you attend an accelerated or part-time program, law school will take three years. In your first year, you will take foundation courses in torts, contracts, property, civil procedure, criminal law, and constitutional law.

You may end up taking 1L classes with the same people. Get to know your âsectionâ because these people may be the source of career opportunities and contacts down the road.

, Law school can be very isolating, as all students are striving to do the best that they can to master complex, difficult material. You will spend a lot of time alone in the library. Be sure to periodically put the books away and try to meet other people. Join a sports league or a student organization just to unwind.


Another good way to meet people is to join a study group. In addition to the comradery, you will also get help with exam preparation, share notes and outlines, and have a group of people to talk through difficult legal issues with.
If you join a study group, however, stick with it. No one likes people who join a group only to drop out after a month.

, Your grades will follow you around your entire career. Though the importance of grades decreases over time, poor grades could keep you locked out of jobs, at least initially.If you want to practice real estate law at a large firm, then doing well in your 1L classes is critical. Large firms will hire summer associates on the basis of your 1L grades. If you want to work at a large firm or in-house at a large corporation, then you should plan on getting grades at the top of your class.
To get an idea of how well you need to do to be competitive with large employers, visit your career services office and ask what large firms or corporations come onto your campus to interview. Career Services should also have information on the GPA required to be hired by these large firms.

, Some law schools help place students with a real estate attorney, either at a title insurance company or at a law firm. Students will help out with a variety of tasks, such as title, closing, contract, and other problems.Externships can be taken for credit. If your school does not allow externships for working with a real estate attorney, then you could think about working part-time after your 1L year.

, During the summers you can work for attorneys as a clerk or a summer associate. You should begin looking for these opportunities in the spring semester. Larger firms will advertise through your schoolâs Career Services. However, you can also send out a copy of your resume and transcript and ask if a position is available.


Although you may be paid, money should not be the primary purpose of a summer job. Instead, you should begin building your reputation. Be sure to do your best work.
If you do good work, then your employer may remember you later when you are looking for a job. Be sure to hang onto contact information, such as phone numbers or emails, and send an occasional email to check up or just say âhi.â
Be sure to get writing experience in your summer jobs. Employers usually ask for a writing sample when you apply for a job, and it is best to have a âreal worldâ writing sample, such as a contract you helped draft for an employer, than something written for a legal writing class.

, The Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) is required to practice in all but three jurisdictions in the United States. The exam is made up of 60 questions, which test your knowledge of legal ethics.You will take the exam in your third year of law school.

, Each state bar admits its own lawyers and administers its own bar exam. Contact the bar of the state where you wish to practice.They will provide you with a list of the necessary steps to take.

, In almost every state you have to pass a written exam before you can be admitted to the bar. The exam typically includes an essay portion as well as a multiple choice test.The bar exam is typically offered twice a year. There is usually a summer exam (offered in June or July) and a winter exam (offered usually in February). If you have to take the bar exam over, you have to pay each time you take it.

, You will need to prepare extensively for the bar exam. Most people try to take a bar prep course, which usually runs for several months. Costs can reach several thousand dollars.If you canât afford a full prep course, then you might want to seek out old study guides published by bar prep companies. Many people sell old guides on eBay and other online retailers.

, In addition to passing the bar exam, you also need to pass a character and fitness review.You initiate the review by completing a detailed survey on your employment history, educational history, and criminal/financial history.


Common problems with character and fitness include criminal convictions, financial irresponsibility (such as bankruptcy), and accusations of plagiarism. These may not completely block you from admission, but be prepared to discuss them with the character and fitness committee. If anything looks suspect to the committee, it will call you in for an interview.
Always be honest when filling out the background survey. It is better to be upfront than try to hide something and get caught.

, The bar exam is typically a two-day exam. One day consists of a multiple-choice exam covering topics such as contracts, constitutional law, criminal law, evidence, and torts.The other day will be made up of essays on state-specific topics.It will take several months to receive your score. In Illinois, for example, those who take the exam in July will not receive their results until the first two weeks of October., If you want to practice real estate with a large law firm or with a large corporation, then you will probably need to sign up for on-campus interviews (OCI) and interview. Before the start of your 2L year, large law firms and corporations interview students for summer associate positions at their firm (or in-house) for the following summer. If they like you, they will probably extend an offer to join them after you graduate.


Your Career Services office will send out detailed requirements for participating in OCI, such as preparing a resume and ordering copies of your transcript. Be sure to follow all policies to the letter, otherwise you could be prohibited from participating in interviews.

, Smaller firms often advertise online. You can check Craigslist, job aggregators like Indeed.com, and with your state bar association, which may have a jobs board. You will be asked to forward a resume, cover letter, and writing sample, so have those ready to go.


Smaller firms often want applicants to already have passed the bar exam, so you may not be able to search for these jobs until you have the results of the bar exam.

, Another way to find jobs is to meet with lawyers for informational interviews. After taking the bar exam, you should identify real estate attorneys whose practices you would like to learn more about. Draft a letter (not an email) and introduce yourself. Be sure to mention who gave you their name.


In the letter, explicitly state that you are not asking for a job. You will get a better response this way. The purpose of the interview is to create an initial contact. If you make a good impression, the lawyer may remember you later for a full-time job or for part-time contract work.
Draft at least five questions about the lawyerâs practice and be engaged during the meeting. Take notes and ask follow-up questions.Ask the attorney if she knows anyone else you can meet with. Be sure to send a thank you note afterwards.

, If you cannot find a job after passing the bar, re-connect with attorneys you worked for during the summer or part-time during the school year. They may have overflow work for you to do, such as research assignments, contract review, or closings to attend.


You can also cold call other real estate attorneys and ask if they have any overflow work. If you do not have a job, you should be most focused on building your reputation and not be picky about how much you get paid. If you do good work for low wages (or even for free), then the attorney may come back to you with additional work.

, Even if real estate law is your dream, you need to start with a first job to gain legal experience (and pay the bills). Ideally, you could work for a general business lawyer, who may do real estate work as one part of his or her practice. Otherwise, you will need some sort of legal job in order to get legal experience.


Regardless of your first job, you can try to get real estate law experience in your free time. For example, you can do pro bono work. Volunteer at a local legal aid organization and help non-profits with their contract disputes, real estate closings, and other legal problems.
You could also increase your familiarity with real estate issues by writing bar articles on real estate law, offering seminars to small businesses on real estate issues, or sitting on a local government board that handles land use and zoning.

, As your career advances, be sure to raise your profile by offering continuing legal education courses, joining bar association committees, and joining real estate bar associations. Many states, like Illinois, have a Real Estate Lawyers Association. Members are invited to events and seminar, and work together to address the concerns of the profession.


You can also seek board certification in real estate law, if your state offers it. Ohio, for example, offers two specialist certificates in real estate, one in Real PropertyâBusiness, Commercial, and Industrial Law and the other in Real PropertyâResidential Law.To earn the certification, attorneys must show that they devote a significant portion of their practice to real estate law, take advanced courses in the field, and submit references.In many states, they also must pass a written exam.

Provide copies of your Estate Planning documents to the appropriate parties.",How to Do Estate Planning," A Living Will is a legal document that tells your family and healthcare providers what types of medical treatment you wish to receive, or do not wish to receive, should you be suffering from a terminal illness and become unable to communicate. Living Will documents vary from state to state, and can be very narrow or very broad, based on your stateâs laws. If you wish to make certain healthcare decisions now, instead of leaving them up to your family later, you may want to execute a Living Will. Some of the items a Living Will may address include:


Food and Hydration. In some states, food and hydration are considered life saving treatment and may be refused by a terminally ill patient. In Indiana, for example, a person may choose to receive food and hydration, not to receive it, or intentionally make no decision, leaving it up to his or her family when the time comes.
Use of a Respirator. Most states address the use of a respirator in a Living Will, allowing residents to decline it as a life saving measure.
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (âCPRâ). Many Living Wills address the use of CPR, providing for âdo not resuscitateâ orders to be written directly into the document.;
, To find a Living Will form recognized in your state:


Check with your local hospital. Most hospitals offer free Living Will forms, which are recognized by the state in which the hospital is located.
Review your stateâs Health Code. Many states provide a form right in the Health Code. To locate your stateâs Health Code, use your favorite search engine to search âYOUR STATE Health Codeâ, for example if you live in New Jersey, you would want to search âNew Jersey Health Codeâ.
Look at your stateâs Probate Code. If you cannot locate a statute governing Living Wills in your stateâs Health Code, check the Probate Code for a form. You can find your stateâs probate code, but clicking on the name of your site at Cornell Universityâs Law School's List of State Probate Statutes.

, Once you have located the proper form for your state you can execute your Living Will by filling it out and signing it in front of the appropriate witnesses and/or a notary public.

, A Health Care Representative may also be referred to as a Health Care Power of Attorney. This is the person who will make your heath care decisions for you, should you ever become unable to make them yourself. Most people appoint their spouse, child(ren), or a parent as their health care representative.

, One such form may be found on Find Lawâs website. You may also want to check your stateâs Health Code, Probate Code, or with an attorney to find a form recognized by your state, or ensure Find Lawâs form will be.

, Fill in the requested information and sign your appointment in front of a notary public. Have the notary sign and seal or stamp the appointment.

, A POA is a document that appoints someone to act on your behalf in financial matters. While it does not take away your right to act on behalf of yourself, it does grant the appointee the right to do anything you would be able to do with your money. Therefore, you must trust the person you appoint as your power of attorney completely.

, The standard form for a power of attorney will vary from state to state, but many can be used in any state. A couple of reputable places to find a Power of Attorney form include:


Your state or county Courtâs website. Many state and county Courtâs offer free forms on their websites. To locate your state and county courts, click on your state on the list of links maintained by the National Center for State Courts.
ExpertLaw.com. Expert law provides a free sample POA. You may modify this form to fit your particular needs and your stateâs requirements.

, Sign your POA in front of the witnesses and/or notary required by your state. If you are unsure what your stateâs requirements for witnesses and notary signatures is, check your State Code, with a licensed attorney, or a reputable paralegal or document preparation company in your area.

, There are a few different ways that you can do this:


Make out a Last Will and Testament (âWillâ). Depending on how simple or how complicated your plan is, you may be able to use forms you find online, such as at Legal Zoom, or you may need to talk to an Estate Planning attorney.
Title your property jointly. Property with a joint owner listed on the title generally passes to the surviving joint owner upon a partyâs death. This includes property such as bank accounts, vehicles, and real estate. Check your stateâs property laws or with a local attorney to determine what the law regarding heirship of joint property is in your state.
Designate a beneficiary. Retirement, savings, and investment accounts, generally allow an owner to name a beneficiary to whom ownership should be transferred upon his or her death. In many states beneficiaries may also be named on vehicle and real estate titles. Check with the investment company, bank, or the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to determine if you name a beneficiary and obtain instructions for doing so.

, Once you have all of your estate planning documents, you will probably want to give your health care representative a copy of your Health Care Representative Appointment and your attorney-in-fact (the person you named on your POA) a copy of your POA document. Copies of your Living Will should be given to Health Care Representative, your physician, and your local hospital. Many people also choose to provide copies of their Will to all of their beneficiaries, or those named in the Will.

Failure to identify the right sort of license could lead you to obtain a license that will not allow you to become a real estate auctioneer.;
, This is the best way to discover the requirements for obtaining the auctioneerâs license you need. If you cannot find the list of criteria online, contact the local auctioneers authority directly and ask for a list of criteria necessary to obtain the license., In most jurisdictions, youâll need to receive some specialty training at an auctioneering academy or college in order to become an auctioneer. If possible, take classes at an education institute that specializes or offers courses in becoming a real estate auctioneer.The number of credit hours and the specific content of the educational requirements will vary from place to place.
In the course of receiving your educational requirements, you will learn how to call bids, start an auction business, and market your services.

, Before you can get your license, youâll likely need to take a written exam in order to test your knowledge of auctioneering process and practice. Contact the government body that administers auctioneers exams in your locality to schedule the exam.After youâve scheduled the exam, ask the administering authority (typically the board of auctioneers) how you can best study for the exam.

In some cases, you might be able to achieve an exemption from continuing education requirements based on the length of time youâve held an auctioneerâs license or your age.

, Not all real estate licenses will enable you to become a real estate auctioneer. For instance, in some localities, you will be able to work as a real estate auctioneer if you have a real estate brokerâs license but will not be able to work as a real estate auctioneer if you have a real estate salespersonâs license. To determine which license you need (if any), contact your local auctioneers licensing board., The process by which you can identify how to obtain your real estate license varies from place to place.

Each organization has different criteria, so check these requirements carefully.
If you think you qualify for membership, send the organization an email expressing your interest in joining or sign up online.

, Negotiating skills are very important for real estate auctioneers. To develop negotiating skills, learn to find out what your buyers want. If nobody is willing to pay for a property at your opening price point, donât be afraid to drop the opening price to get the bidding started.Even when bids start low, bids will often climb quickly to your original desired price.
Use a reasonable bidding increment. If you start at a property being auctioned for $100,000, for instance, you could increase by $5,000 per bid, but do not increase bids by $50,000 or more.

, Entice auction-goers by emphasizing the good elements of the property. When auctioning real estate, your buyers will likely be looking for property that is not too expensive and is in good shape.If the property is a house, emphasize the beauty of the neighborhood and its proximity to schools.
If the property is an industrial site, emphasize its room for expansion and any installed machinery that might be sold along with the property.
Use short pauses between each bid to keep the bidding process moving. For instance, if the property is at $100,000, say â$100,000! Do I hear $105,000?â in an excited and energetic voice. This excitement can be infectious and make auction-goers more eager to bid.

, Once youâve met the educational requirements necessary for your auctioneerâs license, you will need to put your training to practical use by working under an experienced auctioneer. Find an auctioneer willing to train you by contacting your local auctioneers licensing board or your national auctioneers association. You may also be able to contact a licensed auctioneer directly if you wish to train under a particular individual.If possible, mentor under an auctioneer who specializes in real estate auctions.
You will likely need a mentor in the real estate business, too. Contact local or national organizations of real estate professionals and ask if they can help connecting you to a mentor.

, Once youâve found a mentor in the real estate and/or auction industry, you can begin your internship or apprenticeship under their tutelage. The amount of time you need to apprentice under another auctioneer varies from place to place. You might need to be an apprentice for up to two years or more.As an auctioneerâs apprentice, you will have hands-on experience selling items or properties at auction.
Working as an intern at a real estate agency, you will be able to review and negotiate real estate loans, participate in property tours, and research potential investment opportunities.These positions may or may not be paid. Look for one that offers pay.

, After completing your internships and obtaining your licenses, youâre ready to start your career as a real estate auctioneer. Ask your network -- your mentors, teachers, and colleagues -- about opportunities in the real estate auctioneers business. Additionally, check classifieds and job boards online. Look at the job listings posted on the sites of some real estate auction houses in your area and identify jobs that match your skill set.If you canât find a real estate auctioneer business willing to take you on, think about starting your own real estate auction business.

Make a list of at least 5 offices to visit in person.

, Visit the offices on your list in person. Obtain and review brochures or printed material that will help you assess the officeâs structure and operations. Talk with the receptionist or an active agent in the office to gauge their opinions of the local offices.Find out if the company is well established, and the kind of reputation it has locally and nationally.

, Once you have narrowed down your list to three different real estate offices, set up an interview with a broker from each office. There are major differences among companies in regard to structure, operation, and philosophy. The goal is for you to find an office that is the right fit for you. You will be paying the broker to sponsor you, so approach the interview as if you are the interviewer and the broker is the interviewee. Important questions to ask the broker are:âWhat is your market share?â More than 70% is a pretty good indicator that you are at a top office.
âHow many agents work out of the office?â
âHow many top agents do you have?â Top agents are persons who sell more than 15 homes in a year.
âWill I be working as an independent contractor, or an employee?â
âIs there a training plan in place for new agents?â
âWhat kind of ongoing education do you offer your agents?â Some offices pay for their agentsâ continuing education classes.

, You can also find brokerage supervisors by joining a real estate organization. There are many organizations throughout the state of Montana. The associations hold annual or seasonal events where you can network and meet possible supervisors.Join an association such as the Montana Association of Realtors, Missoula Organization of Realtors, and the Billings Association of Realtors.

, Complete and submit an application online or through the mail. There is a $185 application, which includes a $35 account recovery fee. The application includes a section where your supervising broker agrees that they will actively supervise and train you. Your application must be completed no later than 15 working days prior to the Board of Realty Regulation's next meeting. Along with your completed application, you must also submit:Verification that you completed high school, or a high school equivalent.
Proof of your pre-license course completion.
A copy of your AMP test results.
Documentation for proof of age, for example, a driverâs license, passport, or a birth certificate.
A license from any licensing jurisdiction in which you hold a current license, or in which a license has been previously issued, if applicable.

, Once you obtain your license, you will need to complete a 12-hour rookie course by the first renewal date, i.e., October 31st, following your original license issue date. The rookie course is designed to give new agents a basic knowledge of the industry, for example, history, code of ethics, and changes in the industry.You can take this course online or in person. Your real estate office can provide you with an approved school.

, All real estate agents are required to complete a minimum of 12 hours of continuing education every licensing year. The licensing year is from November 1st to October 31st. Therefore, you must complete your courses by October 31st. , Many realtors stay and work for the company that supervised them. If not, it is recommended that you work for a company for a few years before you start working for yourself. This way you can develop a client base, and do not need to start from scratch.


Once you have developed a solid reputation for yourself, then look into self-employment.

Learn the particular requirements for the state of Iowa, along with any other information specific to the location youâll be working in. Iowa realtors are expected to be over the age of 18, be able to pass a background check and must not have had a previous application rejected in any state within a year of applying.You may be younger than 18 when beginning the process of becoming an agent, but must have turned 18 before submitting your sales license application.;
, One of the state requirements that can instantly disqualify you from earning a real estate sales license is a review of your criminal record. You will be asked to undergo fingerprinting and submit to a federally-conducted background check prior to applying for your license, and any felony charges that the investigation uncovers are grounds for dismissal by the Iowa Real Estate Commission. Certain repeated misdemeanors may also knock you out of the running, though most background checks are carried out on a case-by-case basis and the exact criteria of evaluation is not public knowledge.Applicants are expected to pay for fingerprinting and any other processing expenses resulting from a background check. Fingerprinting fees are $46, made payable to the Iowa Real Estate Commission.Fingerprinting reports usually take between 8-10 weeks to process and are valid for 90 days after they're received, meaning applicants should schedule their background check within 90 days of submitting their licensing paperwork.

, The state of Iowa demands that all prospective brokers take a 36 hour Commission-approved training course, along with 60 hours of official education on real estate procedure. These courses must be completed within 12-24 months and cover a specific set of subjects that all applicants must have studied before they are able to register for the licensing exam. The state regulated courses must be attended in person, and none can be skipped or substituted. Both study courses are held at various times and locations throughout Iowaâyou can view course schedules and sign up online at http://www.iowarealtors.com/education/class-schedule/.The 36 hour course consists of 12 hours of Buying Practices, 12 hours of Listing Practices and 12 hours of Developing Professionalism and Ethics. This course is mandatory for all license applicants.The 60 hours of additional classroom education must be completed separately from the 36 hour pre-licensing course, and covers topics like zoning, real estate insurance, contract law, appraising and closing procedures. These courses can be attended in person or taken online.

, If you donât have the time to devote to the 60 hours of ongoing education in person, you can consider fulfilling your education requirements via an online program. These programs were set up to help people study for the licensing exam on their own time and can be a great convenience if you have a busy schedule. You can enroll in the online program through the Iowa Association of Realtorsâ website.Make sure the online program you choose has been approved by the proper agencies before you enroll.
Both classroom and online courses will cost upwards of $500., Research the state requirements for new real estate agents thoroughly to discover if there is any further education or paperwork you need to deal with. Real estate is an evolving field, and regulations are constantly changing. Advancements in internet technology have also changed the way education and licensing are carried out. You donât want to complete your mandatory courses of study only to find out that you need to do more.Your safest bet is to contact your stateâs real estate commission directly. They will inform you of all up-to-date requirements for obtaining a license.
Occasionally, new agents who are hired by brokerage agencies will be expected to put in continued educational hours once theyâre on the job.

, To be eligible for a real estate license in Iowa, you must first pass a licensing exam. This exam is provided by PSI Examination Services, and you can fill out and mail a registration form to the PSI offices or schedule an exam online through their website at http://www.psiexams.com/. After registering, you may choose to take the exam at any of the organizationâs testing centers across the state.If you are forced to cancel or reschedule an exam for any reason, you will need to file a separate motion with the PSI.

, Before you even begin studying for your licensing exam, it can be helpful to brush up on Iowaâs real estate laws and the attendant regulations for brokerage businesses. Reviewing the legal codes listed on the Iowa governmentâs website will give you a leg up when it comes time to take your exam. It can also help inform your expectations of what youâll be getting into once you start working as a realtor.The bulk of the question on the licensing exam deal with Iowa real estate codes and their application in sales.
Take a look at some of the most common questions asked by agents just getting their start. These may expand your understanding of more obscure legal topics. For instance, is a broker responsible for advertising of a property? Does a real estate license permit an Iowa state realtor to sell motor homes? What information is required in closing statements?, Take advantage of the study materials recommended by the Iowa Association of Realtors. These include an official test outline that serves as a study guide for the exam as well as a practice test that is available through the PSI website. The PSI has also compiled a list of additional sources that will be useful for applicants who wish to do some further reading before taking the exam.Certain materials, including online study courses and practice tests, will have additional fees associated with them.

, Show up to the designated PSI testing center to take your licensing exam. Call upon the knowledge you have accumulated in the months of study leading up to testing. The exam is broken up into two sections, covering national and state real estate law and other business related topics. There are a combined total of 120 questions, and test takers are allotted three hours to complete the exam.The national portion of the exam is comprised of 80 questions, 56 of which must be answered correctly in order to pass. The state portion is 40 questions, and you must be able to get at least 28 right.

You can submit to a background check at any point prior to applying for your state sales license., All realtors operating in the state of Iowa must be employed by a sponsored brokerage agency in order to work. Choose an agency where you think you might be a good fit. Take into consideration the size of the agency, their reputation, the type of properties they handle and whether or not you think there would be opportunity for advancement. Start your search early, ideally while you're still completing your initial coursework, so that you'll have plenty of time to narrow your options down before you have to make a choice.Brokers represent and help market realtors, provide sales leads and offer continued on-the-job training to keep sales agents at the top of their game.
Have a list of questions prepared that will help you audition different brokerages. Some of these questions might be: How much combined experience does your agency have? How does your agency find leads? How long does it take to start collecting commission? Does your agency require additional coursework or education?, Another requirement for real estate license applicants is that they carry insurance for Errors and Omissions. Errors and Omissions insurance (commonly referred to as âE&Oâ) is a type of liability insurance that protects agents from litigation as a result of negligence or failure to meet clientâs expectations. It is non-negotiable for realtors in Iowa to be insured for E&O, but it also makes a good safety net should you make a mistake or find yourself in a contractual dispute.Proof of E&O insurance is generally part of the materials required for your license application.E&O insurance premiums for real estate agents start at around $400., Once you've passed the licensing exam, you can begin the formal process of applying for your real estate salesperson license. An application form will be mailed to you, along with your exam scores.

After your application has been accepted, you'll be cleared to begin working as a full-fledged real estate agent!You must fill out and submit your license application within six months of receiving it in order to be issued a license. Deadlines are absolute.
An Iowa real estate salesperson licence is valid for 3 years, after which continuing education hours are required for renewal.Once you become a licensed real estate agent, you will effectively be in business for yourself, serving clients and making commission from sales.

Consider buying one or two properties down the road.",How to Become a Property Manager2," Before you have the necessary capital, connections, and experience to invest in your own properties, you need to work in an entry-level job. You will benefit from this by having a supervisor mentor, a steady income, and gaining experience a variety of property management tasks. There are a few paths to go for finding an entry level job.

A good property manager is the key to proper management of a realtor's rental properties. Submit your resume highlighting your skills pertaining to property management.

, Many apartment complexes or government housing facilities utilize assistants.

Look for properties to buy.,
Find renters.,
Keep meticulous financial records.,
Know state and local laws.,
Keep up maintenance on your properties.",How to Become a Property Manager3," An education and the right amount of money are not all the ingredients of a successful property manager. You should get a feel for the everyday life of a property manager by working as one for someone else. This will also expand your network of colleagues in the industry. The more you prepare for your career, the smaller the learning curve later on.

, Once you have built up some experience and income, find a good time to invest in properties. You will need a considerable amount of money, which will likely have to come from elsewhere. The two best ways to raise this money are by either finding investors or taking a loan.


Take a loan. Banks are a good place to look for a loan to buy houses. Some banks even specialize in funding real estate ventures. Gather your credit information and meet with a few banks to see what they are looking for, and what they expect from you.
Find investors. Using the connections you made, ask around to see if anyone is interested in investing in a new property manager. When making pitches to potential investors, make sure you name the specifics: what exactly they are investing in, who is involved, exact financial numbers, why you make a good manager., Beyond the financial limitations of a new property manager, you donât want to stretch yourself too thin while you are still getting off the training wheels. Look into buying 1 or 2 properties and expanding from there when you feel comfortable. Properties are listed in various places such as the internet, newspapers, or even with your realtorsâ association.

, Based on the properties you own, some listing methods may be better for finding renters than others. Renters in college towns generally look on the internet first, while families or professionals may check with realtors. Make sure you evaluate their ability to pay rent on time, cleanliness, and credit history before agreeing to rent them the property.

, Now that you donât have a boss to report to, all benefits and drawbacks of property management fall on your shoulders. There are many reasons to keep track of your finances, and they are all incredibly important to the well-being of your business. Establish a system and a routine for keeping these records, and stick to it.Tax purposes. Avoid any surprises in future audits by keeping track of your numbers and reporting them accurately to the government.
Approaching investors. Knowing specific financial numbers will make it easier for you to give precise presentations to investors, which will impress them.
Making wise investments. Only by knowing the success of current and previous properties can you make better investments in the future.
Operating costs and expenditures. A large part of your job is maintaining your properties. Keeping track of your finances will help you determine the profit margin for each property.

, You are now solely responsible for making sure that your properties meet the governmentâs codes and regulations. You will likely have learned many of these in previous years, but keep a copy of the codes and regulations handy and make yourself aware of new developments. Not only will this help you keep your properties safe and livable for your tenants, but help you avoid lawsuits and failed inspections.

, The best property manager is one that prevents future problems with regular maintenance. You should also be responsive to your tenantsâ maintenance requests. Being prompt and courteous is a great way to keep quality renters in your properties. Keeping your properties maintained will also enable you to find quality renters when someone moves out.

Become a broker.",How to Become a Real Estate Agent," Though there is an exam you'll have to pass that may differ in every state, the general requirements to be able to take that test are the same. There are actually just a couple basics. You must:


Be at least 18 or 19 years of age.
Be a US citizen.
Have completed your required pre-license education (varies by state -- usually 3+ related classes).;
, To be a real estate agent, you don't need a degree from a four-year university, keyword there being need. However, it's important to know that because degrees are becoming more and more common, it's good to have one to cover your bases. Those with degrees generally are regarded a bit higher and may see more opportunities for advancement.You can major in real estate at some schools, which starts you well on your way to becoming a broker (the one who manages all the real estate agents). If you don't want to major, you could take a few classes and see if the state waives the classes it normally would require you to take.
It's a good idea to have some knowledge of business, marketing, economics, and law. To succeed in the field, this is a good starting point to learn what you're going to be dealing with.

, Each state should have a webpage dedicated to which schools have accredited real estate programs. Most of these classes will be at the college level. You don't have to take them in any order or together, if time or money doesn't allow. Once you find a suitable school in your area, contact them! Classes should regularly be offered.


You'll be handing in your transcripts at the end of these courses to apply for a license, so get good grades! The better you do, the better you'll do on the exam. While the exam is pass/fail in nature, the more confident you are in your abilities, the better you'll feel overall.
You'll need to get in somewhere between 40 and 200 hours, depending on your locale.

, Each workday is spent making contacts with clients, prospecting, and simply getting yourself or your name in front of others. You are essentially working for yourself, which means taking care of your lead generation, your office management, and all your own advertising, education, scheduling, and paperwork. Are you looking to start your own business? That's what real estate is!


Real Estate provides a career that has unlimited potential for income -- which means you could make a lot if you work hard, or only a little if you don't. It offers you a very flexible schedule -- though often irregular hours --, as well as a chance to make a difference with many people.
This is not a hobby. Hobbies can be put down and picked back up whenever you feel like it. In order to stay viable in the real (estate) world, you have to be constantly making connections and working your butt off. Can you handle it?

, When you're just starting anything, it's an uphill battle. When you're just starting a job that's commission-based, it's slim pickin's until you get a solid foot in the door. Because of this, it's important to have some money saved up to get you through those rainy days. Your mom told you ""it takes money to make money,"" right?


You'll mainly be taking these first few months to build up your clientele and get a feel for the market and for your niche. It's a necessary evil that every new agent goes through.

, As with 99% of all things, it's now done online. You can find the forms (and the fee listings) on your state real estate commission's website. Once you fill them out and everything's accepted, you'll get notice of how and when to take your licensing exam.


If you're a little sketchy on the process, wikiHow probably has an article on how to get a real estate license in your state, whether you're in California, Florida, or Pennsylvania -- the list goes on and on.

, A routine part of receiving real estate licensure is passing a complete background check. The fee for this should be part of your application fee. Once you receive an entity number, you can then make an appointment to get printed (it can be done through the testing company). It'll all be there in the paperwork.You will not be given your license if you do not complete this part. This goes for renewal, too, so it's important to keep a clean record. Do this as promptly as possible so it's not a roadblock for your licensure.

, After all the paperwork mumbo jumbo is completed, you'll receive notice of how to register for your exam and the details that follow. This will also be online. You'll go to the site, pick a date, time, and location and be good to go. It'll also (depending on state) offer you some study material and study tips, too.


Most licenses are only good for your state. While some states do have reciprocity agreements (they've agreed that certain other state licenses are valid in their state), others do not. Check where yours is good at before you go about moving or working across state lines!

, If it's been a while since you've taken your classes or really the information you learned there was in one ear and out the other, it's best to brush up. You should be given some study materials when you start the application process (usually referred to as the Candidate Information Booklet or Brochure), but also do some research on your own time.


Talk to a few other people who have taken your state's exam. What was it like? What areas did it focus on? How long did it last? Is there anything you can breeze over? What do they wish they would've known?

Make sure to submit fingerprints and complete the background check requirements prior to testing. This can expedite the time it will take to process and receive your license.



, Woo! After a trip to some bland-looking, sparsely decorated office, you'll hanker down to a computer, promise you are who you say you are, and answer a series of questions (again, each state's test is different). After that, you're almost home free! Almost.


This doesn't quite make you a real estate agent. You need to be working with a broker to do that. Right now you hold an inactive real estate license. As soon as you get employment (or a ""sponsor"" as Texas would call it), you can then file to get your license moved to active status., This isn't really like the stock market -- sure, there's a buyer's market and a seller's market, but there's much more to it than that. When we say get to know your market, that isn't some phrase to make you feel entitled -- it literally means your market. Every place is a bit different. Go around the area you plan on working and watch the agents. Note the current inventory and how it all works. You'll be way better off hitting the ground running.How does your work?


For example, consider a college town. You're gonna be dealing with lots of renters (young ones), one year or nine month leases, and years that start up in September. That's a lot different than a snowbird community! Every market is a bit different and exposing yourself right away is the best thing you can do for yourself and your career.

, Virtually any broker is looking for personality, a business plan, and the right skill set. They want to see that you know what you're getting into (it can be a lot of work!) and that their demands and goals meet what you plan to accomplish.


Go around your area and talk to brokers and other agents. What are they looking for? What are their goals? Not only do you want to be what they want, but you want to find the ones that speak to you. Ask those around you what they think about their office, their broker and other broker/office managers to get the inside scoop.

, While it's true you're technically working for yourself, it's still crucial that you choose the right broker. And necessary -- a broker is the umbrella company you have to work under (unless you become one yourself). Think of it as a suit you'll be wearing for the rest of your working life. It's gotta be one that is comfortable, but also makes you look good. Where are you going to ""hang"" your license?


You want a company with an established name and reputation. One that people trust. You'll need to get noticed before anything and that will be much easier to do with a solid broker behind you.

This isn't to say to go for the big guys. They often will take a higher cut of your commission, actually. No, just because company A is international doesn't mean you shouldn't work for Auntie Lola's Hometown Realty -- everyone knows and loves Aunt Lo (or so they call her) within 30 miles (48Â km) of your office. That's all that matters.


Consider the focus of any potential broker. If you want to work with middle America, you won't be happy working with a broker that specializes in celebrities' luxury homes. Do some research on the demographics they work with and their earnings.Make sure your broker is available. At the very beginning you'll probably have loads of questions. Working for a broker that doesn't give you the time of day will leave you wandering around aimless, losing focus and losing steam. And leave you in sticky situations!

, About time, eh? Now that you're employed through a broker, you can start legally working as a real estate agent. Generally speaking, your broker can mail in your new status (or somehow alert your state's real estate commission) and you can begin practicing almost immediately.


Depending on your state, your active license will be good for anywhere from two to four years.You'll have to get it renewed when it expires if you want to continue working.

, Some companies will give you veritable training wheels -- they'll hand you some of their clients and in return, you'll give them a cut of your sales (don't rely on this however -- in most cases, you'll be left to your own devices).A mentor is also useful to determine your path to success and help you have accurate expectations.


Even if your mentor doesn't hook you up with clients, it's great to have a person that can show you the ropes. There's way more to the market than first meets the eye and it'll be invaluable to you to have someone that can introduce strategy into the equation.

, Being a newbie real estate agent is going to be a lot of ""Hey, are you looking to move? No? Do you know anybody who is?"" It may seem awkward at first, but after the first 25 times or so, it won't phase you. You'll need to hit up all your friends, their friends, the brothers of their friends, and so on and so forth.


This may seem silly, but unless your broker has handed you a pre-established clientele, it's the only way to do it. And since you don't get any money if they don't give you any money, your acquaintances are risking nothing. So it doesn't hurt to ask!

, There are some hefty fees to being your own start up, but those fees are the kind that pay off. You'll be making business cards, putting ads in papers, magazines, anything read-able, putting your face on bus stop benches and billboards, bribing Google, and pretty much doing anything you can to seem credible.


This will be how you reach out to those not connected to your circle. After the first while, you'll be able to see what pays off and what doesn't and perfect your marketing tactics from there. What does your mentor have to say on the topic?

, When it comes to housing, there are two types of people: buyers and sellers. In order to maximum your list of clients, you need to work with both. Simple logic. Hopefully your broker deals with both ends of the spectrum -- more commission for you!


You may develop a preference (both get stressed out in different ways), but you should still stay as flexible as possible and build up your experience on both ends. The more houses you sell, the better information you can give to your buyers -- and vice versa.

, You are not telemarketer #107 anymore. Your name and face are not only representing you, but they're representing the company you work for. If you're not reliable, you'll lose clients faster than Bruce Willis went bald. Work your hardest. It may not seem like it pays off now, but it'll pay off in the long run.


The thing is with real estate -- you have no repeat customers. It's all about Tammy turning to Tonya and saying, ""You're moving? I had a good experience with this gal at Aunt Lo's. Here, lemme give you her card."" You have to be so good they not only had a good experience, but it was so good they're confident enough to tell their friends.

, If you want to become a realtor (and you probably do, at least eventually), you have to join the National Association of Realtors (the National Realtor Association didn't abbreviate quite right).It basically comprises of you working with a broker who's affiliated with them, paying dues, and attending a certain number of meetings a month. Not hard work!In return, you'll get the status of Realtor, which will give you an air of professionalism and trustworthiness to tote behind your name.

, Straight up, people are lazy. Selling and buying homes is hard. If you want clients, you'll need to do the brunt of the work. Tom and Nancy are thinking about buying a new home? A lunch date is certainly in order then -- and a stroll through a nice neighborhood near a good school that just so happens to have a few of your houses might just have to happen after.


You'll be able to make your own schedule, sure, but it doesn't mean that Tom and Nancy won't call you at 8 PM telling you that they're convinced now that they do want a new home that has that 4th bedroom and they're free tomorrow -- can you make it work? Why, yes, yes you can. That's what you do.

, Your clients are probably working 9 to 5, so you'll need to fill in the other hours. Working 24/7 will be pretty common, especially early on in your career. There is nothing stopping a client from calling you on your birthday and giving you a three-hour window to make a sale. You will have to drop everything you have planned and go. That's how it works.


Your weekends will be full of showings and open houses. Your client wants the run down of all their options. The more clients you have, the more this will happen. Being successful means working when they want, not when you want.

, After you've exhausted all your friends, their old college roommates, the mothers of your little sister's girl scout troupe, you name it -- you'll need to play with the big kids. You've got your business cards out there, your name in the local penny saver, now what else? Give a hoot about your community, that's what.


If you specialize in a town or neighborhood, you want that town or neighborhood of yours to be synonymous with you. Get on the neighborhood committee. Hold parties. Organize a 5k. Do something that gets people knowing you (for starters) and thinking of you as a trustworthy, go-getting leader. Soon enough, they'll be coming to you.

, If you want to be the guy that manages the guys (and gals), you'll need to become a broker. You'll need a few year's experience as an agent and then you can start working your way up towards the next licensed level.


Generally speaking, this requires some sort of degree. At the very minimum, you'd need additional classroom training, similar to the kind you got to become an agent. It may not be something to worry about now, but you may want to consider it for the future.

To schedule, submit your registration materials and fee ($85 for a salesperson, broker, or instructor exam) to PSI. PSI will then send you a confirmation notice stating that you can schedule your exam. You can then call PSI to make an appointment to take the exam.The exams are offered at test sites throughout the state (Metairie, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, and Shreveport) on Tuesdays through Saturdays.
Walk-in registration for the day of the test is not available.
If you must reschedule your exam once youâve made your appointment, you must give PSI notice at least two full business days prior to the scheduled testing date to receive a fee refund.

, The salesperson exam is comprised of 135 questions, 80 for the national portion and 55 for the state portion. The national portion includes topics ranging from eminent domain and property taxes to different types of liens and mineral rights. Meanwhile, the state portion of the exam features questions on specific statutory requirements, conflicts of interest, and the Louisiana civil law system.The PSI website contains an exhaustive outline of each section of the exam.
The outline is a great study tool because it helps ensure you are studying everything that the exam will cover.

, Preparing for the exam is key, since you must obtain a grade of at least 70 percent on the national portion of the exam and at least 73 percent on the state part of the exam to pass.


Plan for several study sessions of 45 to 60 minutes, instead of cramming for hours in the days before your exam. You will learn the material better if you study it over time.
As you progress through the test outline, mark each section as you master the material. When all items have been marked, schedule your exam.
Taking notes while studying or highlighting materials are good ways to mark items to review in the days before the exam.

, One excellent way to prepare for the exam is to talk to people you know. For instance, the broker that is sponsoring you will likely have some experts who can sit down with you and offer some tips about studying for the exam. Be sure to use that as a resource.


Additionally, try setting up study groups with people who are/were in the same classes as you. Studying in a group can help you all retain the information better, as long as you stay focused. Plus, someone else may understand a concept better than you do, just as you may understand something they don't.

, On the day of your scheduled exam, make sure to arrive at least 30 minutes early and have the proper credentials with you. You will need two forms of identification with your signature on them, one of which must contain a photograph. You will also need the original copy of your Examination Authorization Form.If you arrive after the exam has started, you may not be allowed to enter the testing site.
Upon completion of the exam, you will see your score appear immediately on the computer screen. If you do not pass, you will receive a diagnostic report alerting you to topics that you should review for the next time.

, Once you pass the exam, you'll need to have errors and omissions insurance before your broker will sponsor you. Basically, this insurance is focused type of liability insurance that covers you (and the company) when you make a costly error. You can apply for this type of insurance with most major insurance companies, though you're broker may have a preferred company., Now that you've passed, you can officially be sponsored by your broker company. Your sponsoring broker should be notified of your scores on the exam. You'll also need to provide proof of your insurance to your company. After that, your broker should be willing to accept you on."

By state law, AREC maintains certain minimum requirements that all applicants must meet to earn a license as a real estate agent in Alabama. These include:You must be at least 19 years old.
You must be a citizen of the United States, be legally present with appropriate documentation to work in the U.S., or be an alien with permanent resident status.
You must be a resident of Alabama. If you are not a resident of Alabama, you may still qualify if you are willing to sign a statement agreeing to the jurisdiction of the AREC.
Have a high school diploma or GED.;
, The AREC has the authority to deny an application from any individual who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude.Having a conviction on your record does not automatically disqualify you from obtaining a real estate license, but you may have to explain the circumstances and receive special permission.

, You do not qualify for a real estate license in Alabama if, within the last two years, you applied and were rejected or held a license and had it revoked. After two years from any rejection or revocation, you may apply but will need special approval from AREC.If you applied for a license and were rejected, within the past two years, but that rejection was only for failing a written test, you may go ahead and reapply.

, AREC only requires you to have either your high school diploma or a GED to become a licensed real estate agent in Alabama. If you are still in high school and are thinking of becoming a real estate agent, you should continue to work hard and complete your diploma. You might also ask your guidance counselor for advice about classes to take that may be helpful. You may wish to focus on business-related classes like accounting or marketing.If you have dropped out of high school without earning your diploma, you will need to earn a GED. You can find out more about earning a GED and taking classes at a local community college by viewing the website of the Alabama Community College System, at https://www.accs.cc/index.cfm/adult-education/ged/.

, While a high school diploma or GED is the only education requirement for licensing, you will have a better chance landing a job as a real estate agent if you have an advanced degree. According to a recent report by the website OutstandingColleges.com, an associateâs degree in real estate is one of the three best degrees to pursue to become a real estate agent.The Alabama Community College System has a network of colleges throughout the state that offer programs in Business Management & Administration, Finance, and Marketing, Sales & Service, among others., If you wish to take your education beyond the community college level, you could attend a four-year college or university to earn a bachelorâs degree. Some schools even offer specialized programs in real estate, which focus on legal issues, marketing, zoning, tax, banking, and other related topics. As of 2016, the five top-ranked real estate degree programs in the United States are the following:University of Pennsylvania
University of Wisconsin-Madison
University of Georgia
University of California-Berkeley
New York University.

, Even if you choose not to pursue a two- or four-year degree before setting out on your career, you can enhance your resume by getting some advanced training. Enroll in individual courses at your local community college, in subjects that are most relevant to the real estate field. These courses would include any or all of the following:Real estate and zoning law.
Land use and planning.
Ethics.
Environmental issues.
Sales and marketing.
Mortgages and banking.

, Many people interchange the terms âreal estate brokerâ and âreal estate agent,â but the two labels are very different. A broker is someone with advanced education and licensing status, who is eligible to work independently. An agent is someone who is employed by and works in conjunction with a broker. The broker is generally responsible for the actions of the agent.In Alabama, you must be associated with (i.e., employed by) a broker before you can be licensed. Your license will only be issued to your brokerâs office, not to you individually. You will be allowed to work with the broker, but not in the capacity of a licensed agent, until you complete the licensing procedure.

, Research real estate brokers in your area. There are nationwide companies that may have offices in your area. There are also small, independent brokers as well. Bigger is not always better. You will want to find a broker that is recognized in your area and that has a positive reputation. Here are some questions to ask or investigate in selecting a broker:Determine whether you prefer to work as a buyerâs agent or a sellerâs agent. Some brokerâs focus on one side of the business or the other. If you have a preference, make sure it will be a fit.
Research the companyâs earnings and business history in your area. You can find information by contacting AREC and asking about a specific brokerâs history.
Find out what the broker can do to help you build contacts. If you are just starting out in the field, you will need help building a client list. If you come with your own clients, this may not be as necessary.
Find out about the finances. If you join with a large, national broker, you may be responsible for paying commissions or franchise fees to maintain your association. This is not necessarily bad, but you should know the expectations before you begin.
Learn about the working environment. Visit the office of any prospective brokers and try to talk with their agents. Find out how they enjoy the work environment. Ask about any issues that are important to you (work hours, office morale, sales requirements).

, You will need to make yourself appear as desirable to the broker as possible. Emphasize any experience you have in the field, as well as whatever education you have. Other qualities that make a strong real estate agent would include familiarity with the local community, a strong outgoing personality, and an eagerness to work hard. Selling real estate can be an uncertain profession that is really based on the level of effort that you are willing to put into it., In addition to meeting all the eligibility and education requirements, every applicant for a real estate salesperson license in Alabama must complete a 60-hour prelicense course. Numerous schools, colleges and private agencies offer pre licensing courses, both online and in classroom study programs. You will want to find a program that is convenient to you and that is also certified by the Alabama Real Estate Commission. If you have questions about a program, ask for their certification number and contact AREC to verify.ARECâs website provides information about certified programs and their passing rates on the certification exam. You can find links to everything you need at https://arec.alabama.gov/arec/pages/professionals/edu/approved_schools.aspx.

, After completing your prelicense course, you must pass the Real Estate Licensing Exam within six months.The exam is offered by computer at AMP (Applied Measurement Professionals) locations throughout the state. Exams are administered by appointment only, Monday through Friday at 9:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The fee for the exam is $73.00, payable by credit card, cashierâs check or money order.To make an appointment and register for the exam, visit the website www.goamp.com and select the link âCandidates.â From there, follow the instructions to select a testing date and time.

If you need to take the test outside of Alabama, contact the Alabama Real Estate Commission at (334) 242-5544 for authorization and more information.

, The only way to obtain a real estate license application is to pass the licensing exam. An application will be provided to you with your passing score report. To complete the application form itself, you will need the following information:Your name and basic contact information.

Gain work experience in sales or marketing.,
Consider enrolling in business courses.,
Think about your options.,
Apply for an entry-level position.,
Follow the licensing requirements where you will work.,
Consider obtaining certification from a national organization.,
Build your network of contacts.,
Decide how independent you should be.",How to Become a Leasing Broker," Learning to sell to businesses and/or individuals is invaluable experience. If you plan to work in equipment brokerage, marketing experience may be especially valuable, especially if you understand how to sell intangible services.


Selling anything from flowers to life insurance will enable you to gauge and develop your interpersonal skills and sales techniques. Some people may be more naturally inclined to excel at sales, but the ability to persuade others to buy what youâre offering can be developed through practice.
You can gain this experience while in college or just after high school. Working in a high-pressure sales environment, such as telesales, will acquaint you with sales quotas, commissions and incentives. If you find that this constant pressure to make sales is not for you, then you are unlikely to enjoy being (or be successful as) a leasing broker.If possible, get some experience with intangible sales. This involves selling a service, not a physical product that can be seen and touched. Examples include selling insurance or trying to sell a product based on something like its environmental benefits, or selling a service like bike repair. Intangible sales require you to become extremely proficient in creating a rapport with a customer and learning to tell a story when selling your product.;
, While critical, sales skills are only part of what is required in the leasing brokerâs toolkit. Among other things, he/she must also be entrepreneurial and know how to manage finances. You can take a course that highlights a certain subject or go to school for a degree.


In the U.S., requirements vary by state regarding what (if any) coursework you need (in addition to any licensing requirements) to become a leasing broker. Required or not, taking classes in marketing, finance, and real estate ethics, for instance, will help prepare you for the field and gauge your interest level in it.If you want to earn a bachelor's degree, you may want to choose business administration. You can also earn a two-year associate's degree in business or business management from a community college.

, The term âleasing brokerâ carries several connotations; some people, for example, associate it primarily with real estate rentals, others with leasing business equipment. There are many similarities within these variations, but also differences worth considering.If you become a broker for residential properties â such as finding people apartments â then your people skills will be paramount, along of course with having deep knowledge of the local real estate market and establishing connections with rental property owners.
If you want to focus on commercial properties â finding space for businesses â then adding knowledge about specific business needs to your sales and networking skills will prove essential.
As an equipment leasing broker â in which you arrange agreements between businesses who need but canât buy necessary equipment, and manufacturers or retailers of said equipment â specific knowledge of, for instance, office computer equipment will be critical, as well as knowledge regarding the accounting and tax treatment of leased equipment."".

, Many leasing firms hire and train people who are new to the position. You may be able to apply for these lower level positions without obtaining your license, while you complete your training.


Other options, if you cannot work as a leasing agent yet, may be to intern at a leasing firm or work in an alternate position within the firm. You will still be able to observe, learn, build relationships, and further determine your suitability for the field.
Consider working for at least one year in this environment. On-the-job training will teach you about the product, whether real estate or equipment, and the clientele. You will also learn sales techniques, ethics and the law as it relates to leasing., In the U.S., each state has its own requirements (or lack thereof) for the education and certification of leasing brokers. These requirements can also vary by what type of broker you are (real estate, equipment, etc.).


As one example, in Illinois, a âLeasing Agentâ license permits you to work with residential property rentals. It requires fifteen hours of approved coursework and a passed licensure exam. A âBrokerâ license enables you to work with commercial properties as well (and with buying and selling, not just rentals). It requires ninety hours of coursework and the licensure exam.State licensure requirements tend to be less stringent for leasing brokers who deal with business equipment rentals, but always determine what is needed in your jurisdiction.

, Such certification is not a legal requirement, but will further your education in the field and open the door to wide-ranging contacts in the industry. Here are a few examples:


To obtain National Apartment Association certification as a National Apartment Leasing Professional (NALP), you need a high school diploma or equivalent, six months experience as a leasing agent, the completion of approved coursework, and to pass an exam.
To join the National Association of Equipment Leasing Brokers (NAELB), you need to attend their week-long training school (with testing) and subsequent conference.To become a Certified Lease and Finance Professional (CLFP), also in the equipment rental field, you need three years experience in the field and to pass an exam., Learning from, and networking with, others with experience in your field is critical to getting off the ground as a leasing broker. Build contacts through national organizations if possible, but also with others in your local area.


Knowledge of the local business climate is essential for leasing brokers of all varieties. In equipment leasing, you need to establish close working relationships with local lenders so they will work with you time and again. Repeat business and referrals are the lifeblood of the industry.If you work with residential properties, establishing working relationships with the owners and managers of local rental properties and apartment complexes will be a must.

, Advertisements for careers as a leasing broker often point to the chance to âbe your own boss,â and that can indeed be the case â with all the benefits and hassles that come with it.The degree of independence you seek should depend upon local market conditions and your own preferences.


You can be an independent leasing agent (with ample contacts and connections, of course), or be a franchisee of a larger organization. It is possible that you may also be a contracted employee.While âGoing it on your ownâ may be your eventual goal, you may find that this is not the ideal setup when you are starting out. The more patience you can show early on, as you build up a client base and connections in the community, the more business you can potentially reap in the years to come.

Learn about real estate investing.,
Identify your tolerance for risk.,
Decide between equity and debt.,
Choose the real estate sector you want to invest in.,
Learn about real estate trading.",How to Become a Real Estate Investor1," In order to invest in real estate successfully, you should research the subject thoroughly and be well-versed in how the market functions. There are multiple ways to invest in real estate, and you will need to evaluate your goals and finances to decide which option is best for you.


Real estate is ""an interest in land"" (and anything permanently attached to land). This means that the real estate market is essentially about buying and selling land and buildings. There are two types of ""interest"" at work in real estate: ownership and leasehold. ""Ownership interest"" is taking full control of and responsibility for land and buildings, and ""leasehold interest"" is the granting of certain rights to a tenant in exchange for rent payment.
The most common form of real estate investing is purchasing ownership interest in a property and then earning money from rent paid by tenants.;
, There are two main markets when dealing in real estate. These are the private and public markets. Any investing is risky to some extent, but each market has its own level of risk.



Private real estate involves the purchase of an ownership interest in ""real"" (as opposed to ""personal"") property. You or a property manager would then operate that property and you would earn money on rent paid by tenants. This is a very direct way of investing in real estate because you, as the owner, are responsible for the property.

Public real estate involves purchasing shares of a publicly traded real estate company. Often these companies take the form of investment trusts. You buy shares on the market and are paid dividends as the trust collects rent and value from the multiple properties it owns. Because you only own shares in the company, you are not responsible for the real estate. This is a less direct approach to investing.

, Both the public and private markets operate on equity and debt. As an investor you pick which of those you would like to invest in.


If you are investing in debt, you lend money to someone so that they can buy interest in a property. You earn money in the form of interest payments on a mortgage.
If you are investing in equity, then you are investing in ownership of the property. This means you are assuming all responsibilities for the operation of the land and buildings.

, The four sectors are public equity, public debt, private equity, and private debt.


If you choose public equity, you will want to look at investment trusts. If you choose public debt, you should investigate mortgage securities, which are the debt equivalent of investment trusts, where various mortgages are bundled together to form a single investment.
If you select private equity, then you will most likely be purchasing residential or commercial property and acting as a landlord. If you choose private debt, you will invest in private mortgages.

, This is a variation of private equity investing, also known as flipping. The goal is to purchase a property and then turn around and resell it at a higher price.


These investors try to resell their properties as quickly as possible to minimize their costs of ownership.
Most flippers will make no improvements to their properties, as they can be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, they bank on the market being favorable to them so that they can resell their unaltered property at a profit.
A longer-term flip will see the investor improving the property in an effort to increase its value on the market. This form of investment can be labor-intensive and involve significant expenditures. Many such investors will own only one property at a time.

"
"
Examine your portfolio.,
Evaluate your assets.,
Know that flipping a house can get expensive.",How to Become a Real Estate Investor2," Investing in real estate is typically viewed as a portfolio enhancer, an investment that complements stocks and bonds. Used as part of a larger investment plan, it can add stability to your income.

, Real estate investment can require a significant amount of capital, even beyond the price of the purchase. Ask yourself if you can afford to keep your investment if the market turns bad.


Since real estate is a tangible property, it will require maintenance and upkeep. While this is normally covered by rent paid by tenants, there may be times when there are no tenants to occupy the property, meaning that the costs will fall to the owner.

, If you decide to go into real estate trading, you have to be prepared for the worst. In the year that it might take you to renovate and sell, the market could take a dive and you'd be stuck with mortgage payments while you wait for it to sell.


Make sure that you have the capital to commit to a potentially long-term project.
Research the ins and outs of house flipping before getting involved so that you minimize unforeseen expenses.

"
"
Make a plan.,
Learn to rely on other people.,
Work with a good real estate agent.,
Talk to mortgage brokers.",How to Become a Real Estate Investor3," Decide where and how you want to invest. Take your plan to an accountant or investment broker. Go over the plan with a financial planner. Make sure that everything is accounted for.

, A good real estate investor will not hesitate to enlist the aid of other professionals in order to ensure that the entire process goes smoothly. The type of team you will need will vary depending on your investment.


You may need a mortgage broker, an accountant, a property manager, a real estate lawyer, a home inspector, and an insurance broker

, If you want to invest in real estate, you'll find it invaluable to use an agent experienced in the field of investment properties.


Find an agent who can help you shop for ideal investment properties. Interview several different agents before choosing one. Discuss your goals and your investment plans. A good agent can show you properties that fit your investment strategy.

, Your real estate agent should be able to recommend lenders. Talk to your local banks and credit unions about mortgage financing.


Find out what the brokers, lenders, and banks can offer in terms of interest rates, closing costs and payment terms. Ask about your financing options and choose the mortgage that best fits your budget and investment strategy.

Choose your meal schedule based on what works for you.,
Treat breakfast just as you would any meal.",How to Eat Like a Body Builder," You probably know that the body builder's diet is very high in protein. Growing muscles do need quite a lot of it, but past that point any extra protein is just calories, and therefore less effective than carbs.For most people, 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day should be plenty.However, body builders need to get between 1.2 and 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.To find your weight in kilograms, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2. For example, 200 pounds divided by 2.2 is about 91 kilograms. To get your daily range for grams of protein, just multiply your weight in kilograms by 1.2 and then by 1.7. For example, 91 x 1.2 = 109 and 91 x 1.7 = 155. This means that your range for the day would be between 109 and 155 grams per day. (You can round your answers up or down to the nearest whole number for convenience.)
Some good options for high-protein meals include: London broil/top round steak, salmon, chicken breast and pork tenderloin.Being vegetarian or vegan doesn't mean you can't eat like a body builder. In fact, vegan body builders are becoming more and more common. Some vegan substitutes include soy (and other legumes), seitan, quinoa, buckwheat, and mycoprotein.For breakfast, try egg yolks and oatmeal, or high-protein cereal and a protein shake. Stay away from sugary cereals.;
, Protein shakes are a great way to get more energy in between meals. They're especially useful if you need to fight off junk food cravings.Whey protein is easy to digest and absorb., Skipping meals is as bad as skipping workouts. Your body needs the nutrients in your meals to keep building mass.If life makes it hard to schedule meals, consider keeping a small cooler with you with a meal or two in it at all times., While protein is crucial, it's also important to eat balanced meals. In particular, vegetables and complex carbohydrates need to be a staple in your diet.Some bodybuilders recommend asparagus, broccoli, or spinach, but there are many other options.

, Your body is mostly made up of water. To keep it functioning smoothly, you need to stay hydrated. This is important for everyone, but especially for anyone doing hard training., Some fat is fine, but avoid excessive amounts. Avoid foods with added fats like butter and fried foods.


In particular skip the butter, oil, and rich sauces when possible. Use a light cooking spray in the place of butter and oil whenever you can., Body builders try to ""eat clean."" This means that you should avoid unhealthy choices like fast food and processed food.These foods turn into fat and not muscle. Remember, you are what you eat!, You should avoid refined sugars and other simple carbohydrates in most scenarios. These foods are empty calories that take the place of healthier options that build muscle mass.Your best bet is to get these foods out of your home so you aren't tempted to eat them.Carbohydrates before bed are the worst. Because you won't be exercising for several hours, your body will store these carbs as fat.There is one exception to this rule: right after a hard workout, some simple carbohydrates are okay. If you're craving a bagel right after a session at the gym, you can indulge that craving, as long as you don't forget to eat your protein., When you eat out, you lose some control over what goes into your meal. Restaurant food in general also usually contains more fat and salt than the food you prepare at home. Try not to eat out too often.When you do eat out, try to stick to clean proteins and simple vegetable side dishes. Scan the menu for the choice that best fits the body building diet., Many people hear ""bulk up"" and assume that means you have free reign to eat as much as you want. This is definitely not the case. Body builders need to watch the amount they eat just as much as anyone else.The math here is simple. If you are taking in more calories than you are burning off through exercise, your body will store those calories as fat. As a body builder, your calorie threshold might be higher than the average couch potato. But that threshold is still there.It's a good idea to read food labels, count calories, and make sure you are taking in as close to the right amount of protein as possible. You need lots, but there is such a thing as too much., It's usually a good idea to plan for occasional cheating. If you know you get to cheat on a meal, maybe once a week, it will help control the temptation to cheat at other times.You can use you ""cheat"" meal as a reward for reaching workout goals. This can be a strong motivator!, A pre-bedtime snack can help you fight the urge for an unhealthy midnight snack. Some bodybuilders swear by micellar casein protein for this, either as a supplement or in cottage cheese.The argument goes that this protein takes longer to digest, letting your slower nighttime metabolism take full advantage of it. This is because it is a milk-derived protein that curdles when it contacts the acid in your stomach. This curdling slows down digestion and absorption of amino acids.

, Fats pack in a lot of calories in a small volume, making it easier to meet your meal goals when bulking up. You definitely need some fat for a healthy diet anyway â the question is, what kind? Most experts tout monounsaturated fatty acids and Omeg-3 fatty acids, found in fish and avocadoes.Saturated fat is generally considered unhealthy, but some bodybuilders suggest fitting a small amount into your diet.


Monounsaturated fatty acids and Omega-3 fatty acids are important for muscle growth. They can be found in foods like fish and avocados.

, Used in moderation, dietary supplements can help you fill in any gaps in your diet. Prepackaged body building supplements, along with a good protein powder, can compliment your daily meals.It's important, however, not to over-rely on supplements. You should be getting the bulk of your nutrition from fresh foods, which are better for your body.


Supplement sellers often make inaccurate claims. Most will not have any effect that you couldn't replicate with a good diet.

, One common myth claims you need to eat 6+ meals a day to encourage glycogen storage, or replenish amino acids, or prevent catabolism. A thorough look at the evidence demolishes these ideas.What matters is the amount of calories and nutrients you consume, not how you spread it throughout the day. If you feel better and work out harder on 3-4 larger meals a day, go for it.

, Many bodybuilders overstate the importance of breakfast. In fact, eating in the morning has no extra effect on muscle mass compared to eating at other times.You should eat a healthy, protein-rich breakfast, but choose your portion size and mealtimes based on what makes you alert and ready to work out.

Get motivated.,

Increase the intensity of your walks.,
Set reminders to move.,
Keep a log of your daily actions.,
Encourage your workplace or household to participate in a 10,000 steps a day initiative.","How to Walk 10,000 Steps a Day"," The rationale behind ""10,000 steps"" a day is very simpleââit's about staying motivated. Numerous studies undertaken by health experts revealed that many participants were more excited about counting 10,000 steps through both walking and general movement than by being asked to perform 30 minute walking stints.Instead of viewing exercise as something to slot into a defined period each day, aiming to achieve 10,000 steps daily encourages you to keep moving throughout the day, actively seeking opportunities to add in some more steps here and there so that you accumulate steps throughout the day. And if the goal of 10,000 steps isn't motivator enough for you, here are some other great reasons to add 10,000 steps a day to your routine:


Walking is a low impact, effective way to lose weight.Walking helps to reduce blood pressure.For those with hypertension, walking helps you to manage it better.Walking is good for reducing the risks of heart disease and stroke.Walking improves your cardiovascular and pulmonary (heart and lung) fitness.Walking increases muscle strength, helps create stronger bones, improves your balance and increases your endurance.Walking doesn't have to be either vigorous or prolonged in order to produce benefitsââprovided it's sprinkled throughout your day and consistent, you'll improve your overall fitness.You're never too old to walk. Another risk zone for sedentary behavior is post-retirement, yet a study of over 7,500 women has shown that women over 65 who became active reduced their risk of premature death by 48 percent.
Not walking or moving is hazardous to your health. Researchers studied a group of men that typically walk approximately 10,000 steps per day (as measured by a pedometer) and asked them to reduce their steps to only 1,350 per day. This meant taking elevators instead of stairs, driving to work and lunch. After two weeks, researchers found that the menâs bodies had become worse at metabolizing sugars and fats, not to mention that their distribution of body fat began to migrate toward their mid-section.;
, To keep track of your steps, you'll need a pedometer. These can be purchased as a separate item or you can find them in such items as MP3 players and even in some pairs of shoes. Choose whatever is most cost-effective and practical for your needs; pedometers themselves are fairly inexpensive. When selecting one, check how it clips onto your clothing or belt to make sure it's comfortable, secure and durable.


When researching pedometers, look for existing users' comments about accuracy, reliability and validity of the results. Not all pedometers are reliable.
Provided you don't mind walking with a cell phone, a range of smartphone apps can keep a track of your walking steps, such as iTreadmill, My Weight Loss Coach, and iSteps.
Some digital body tracking devices, like âbodybugâ, go beyond counting steps and can provide you with detailed information about how calories are metabolized based on the amount of activity or steps taken throughout the day. This gets pretty fancy, so only get one if it is information you truly want.

, If you're just getting started, 10,000 steps a day probably seems enormous. Don't worryââit won't take long to reach it! According to research into activity levels, anything under 5,000 steps a day is considered to be a sedentary lifestyle, and it isn't until you reach 10,000 steps a day that you're considered to be ""active"".It is recommended that you begin walking as much as feels comfortable to you, then aim to walk in increments of 1,000 to 2,000 steps more each week until you're comfortably at 10,000 steps a day. There is nothing stopping you walking more than this each day, but the aim is to always make 10,000 steps.

, The aim behind 10,000 steps a day isn't just about deliberate walking but it's also about how much extra movement you can accrue throughout the day. As you get used to this added activity, you'll find yourself looking for all sorts of ways to avoid the easier options (like taking the elevator) and choosing the ones that involve movement (like taking the stairs). Very soon it simply becomes second nature to prefer the option that involves keeping you moving over the usual sedentary practices. Plan the small amount of additional time needed for walking over automated/sedentary approaches into your dayââyou'll be more alert and healthier for it, and therefore likely more productive in the time you do apply yourself to your work. As well as defined times for walks, try these incidental movement options every day:


As noted already, take the stairs instead of the elevator (lift) or escalators.
Walk everywhere you can instead of driving or catching a cab/taking a bus. Whether it's going to or from work, making deliveries or going to meetings in another office, try walking rather than catching transportation or driving.
Improve your fitness and your face-to-face encounters by visiting people in their offices or at their desks to talk, rather than simply emailing or calling all the time.
Stop every 45 minutes of computer work and take a 5 minute stroll around the office area or even duck outside briefly.
Move that chair! Get up from the chair and use it to perform stretches, push it around your office space or cubicle to add up the steps and try standing for a bit instead of sitting, shifting your weight from side to side to maintain movement.
Hand wash your work dishes instead of adding them to the dishwasher. Step from side to side as you do so, adding more movement to your day.
Do your household chores. Instead of seeing them as chores, convert them into more steps! What a way to get the house clean and keep fitââthis might just be enough to convince you to keep moving.

, Walking is an easy, enjoyable and generally safe exercise. It's an opportunity to get out of a building and discover your local neighborhood, park, woods, nature, etc. See walking as a way to stay engaged with your local environment rather than as a chore. Many people find that scheduling a regular time each day works best; however, if you can only slot in times as they come free, make the most of themââwhatever the time of day or night, you're still using the same amount of energy and getting the same benefits. Just be sure to warm up and warm down before and after your walks, to avoid the potential for muscle injury. And to make it even more enjoyable to slot a planned walk into each day, here are some suggestions:


Dress appropriately for the weather; always use layers and be sure to dress warmly or coolly enough for the weather. Use sunglasses and other sun protection during the warmer months. Check that your shoes are comfortable for the walk or get yourself fitted for a decent pair before starting your daily walks. And take appropriate rain gearâârain shouldn't be an excuse for not walking!
Drink plenty of fluids before your planned walk, and after. If your walk will be long, take water with you.
Walk with a friend. If you can get a friend enthused in regular walks, it's likely the two of you won't even notice the distance covered!
Take your camera. Use your walks as an opportunity to record the neighborhood happenings, natural phenomena, anything intriguing or beautiful or perhaps anything that fits with a theme that you like.
Get your kids and family to walk with you. Children love the concept of 10,000 steps a day and will be excited to have their own pedometers and walking goals to meet. They will also be great at reminding you to walk daily.
Take your dog. Daily walks are a necessity for those with a dog, so including Fido will fulfill his exercise needs too and make it more enjoyable for you. And if you don't have a dog? Take your neighbor's dog instead.
Vary your walking routes regularly. This will keep it interesting.
Join a walking club. Make new friends and go to new places for your walks.
Schedule the occasional walking tour. Join locals and tourists alike on walking tours of historic areas of your town. Not only will this help to keep you fit but you'll learn something fun and perhaps unique too.
Use your lunch hour to work out or walk. Walk around the area where your office or work building is located. Getting to know the area better might bring other benefits like finding cool stores you didn't know were there or great new lunch places. Try going in different directions as often as possible.

, Walking and running tend to burn the same amount of calories over the same distance, it is just that running is faster.You can increase the pace of your walk and you can also increase the intensity by doing such things as climbing hills, walking in sand along the beach, walking with hand weights, interchanging between fast and moderate walking paces and walking longer distances as you become more comfortable with walking.


Include self-rewards for increasing both the amount of steps done weekly, as well as intensity increases. Treats could include going out for a meal, seeing a movie, buying something you really want, and so forth.

, Initially it can be challenging to settle into a new routine, including one involving more daily movement. To help yourself, try setting reminders on your computer, watch, MP3 player, cellphone or whatever else you have with you that will prompt you to move for an allotted amount of time. Also be sure to schedule the planned daily walk(s) into your calendar. By setting reminders, you won't forget to build up the day's steps. Eventually it'll become natural and you can stop relying on reminders.

, It doesn't matter what sort of log you useââdigital app, computer spreadsheet or paper notebook and penââjust as long as you keep a record. A lot of the motivation will continue precisely because you can see the results in real form, by way of how many steps you've recorded for each day, and if you're also monitoring weight loss, strength improvement, fitness increases, etc., then you can also watch these change over time. A log can also help you to see which days had reduced steps, helping you to increase the steps another day or to see any sliding back into sedentary habits that might be occurring.


A very basic log is all that's needed, for example: Date: 10 October 2012; Baseline steps: 7, 978 steps. You can add more information if wished but this example represents the most important information to record.
Consider writing down your weekly goals, especially if you're still aiming to reach 10,000 steps a day, or you're aiming to move beyond 10,000 steps a day.
There are sites that will maintain a personal log for you (some also maintain workplace logs). These can also be a great source of contact with others walking 10,000 steps a day, as well as finding resources on walking.

, If you're concerned about the sedentary lifestyle of your office or housemates, consider introducing everyone to the 10,000 steps a day initiative. At work, ask for help from your boss or human resourcesââyour workplace might even be able to fund pedometers for everyone and maintain a workplace log and information section on the intranet to help people to stay motivated. At home, put up an inspirational chart for everyone to log their steps openly. In both cases, model the desired behavior by moving as much as possible throughout the day and taking frequent walks.

Find a good place to walk.,
Make an exercise playlist.,
Set reasonable expectations for your progress.,
Develop a strong mental attitude for ""slow but steady"" exercise.,
Hydrate well before you begin walking.,
Pick an easy first walk.,
Set a time.,
Increase your time.,
Work on speed and difficulty after you are able to walk for 45 minutes each day.,
Determine your target and maximum heart rate.,
After you've worked into a general routine, try switching things up with interval training.",How to Start Walking for Exercise," Generally, the locations for walking have a flat terrain, straight path, smooth surface and minimal traffic. The convenient choice would be the neighborhood around your block, but if the road is too steep, curvy or just not what you're looking for, you might want to consider other areas around your town.


Ensure you are wearing appropriate footwear as walking puts a bit of pressure on your feet which can cause pain. Also, be sure you are wearing the correct footwear for the weather.
Take your car to a park if it's too far away to walk; parks are often flat and very peaceful.
Some cities have bike boulevards or walking paths that are relatively flat and well-maintained. They also generally have less traffic from cars. These are good areas to pick for walking as well.
If you won't be tempted by the stores(shopping), shopping malls are also good locations for walking around. They are flat, large, and probably contain many different paths so you won't become bored.
If you live near a large body of water, the shoreline can be a nice, relaxing place to get some fresh air and to work in an early morning hike.
If indoor exercise is your thing, use a treadmill set to a slow speed for walking.;
, It may help to have music playing as you take your walk, especially if you are easily bored from low-key activities. Consider listening to music that also gives your mind room to wander and think about other parts of your life. You can also listen to music that is upbeat that you know that will keep your motivation your walk. Walks are an excellent opportunity to reflect and plan for the future, although take care to avoid stressful topics. Your walk should definitely be a chance to unwind!

, If you have been sedentary for a long period of time, you will want to start out slower and aim for shorter distances. Write these tangible goals down in a notebook or calendar so that you can keep yourself on track and monitor small successes.


Note, however, that walking is a fairly mild exercise that does not require vigorous physical exertion. Therefore, with the right equipment, you will likely be physically capable of walking for hours. You won't meet the same fatigue that a more vigorous exercise, such as running or weightlifting, could lead to.

, This will be easier for some than for others. To borrow from a popular phrase, walking is definitely a marathon, not a sprint, so get your mental endurance ready before you begin this trek.


Don't expect to see fast results. Incorporating walking into your daily schedule is about making healthier choices towards a better lifestyle, and it's a change that you should maintain indefinitely. Don't use walking as a get-fit-quick scheme or as a quick, one-shot weight loss tool.

, Make sure you have consumed at least 8-16 ounces of water an hour before you are about to walk. Drink more water if you plan to walk for a longer time. You don't want to become dehydrated while you are exercising, especially under a hot sun.


You may find it convenient to carry a metal water bottle with you as you walk, so you can stay hydrated throughout your trek.
Some people develop stomach cramps if they drink water right before or while they exercise, so be careful of that. Give your body time to process the water before diving into exercise.
Don't drink so much water, however, that you'll need a bathroom while on a long walk.

, Make sure that no matter how far you get from your starting point, you are able to get back there. Walking on an oval track no more than a quarter mile around should be perfect.


If you feel comfortable in extending the walk past what you initially set, go for it! As aforementioned, walking is less physically taxing than most activities, so don't be afraid to exceed your goals.

, When you first start walking, decide how many minutes you will walk. Choose a length of time you know you can make. Do not worry about how short that period is. Just keep moving until you reach it. 2-5 minutes each day is a good start. That time will increase from week to week.


Pay no attention to how far you walk. It matters more that you walk for a longer period of time. Faster and farther walks will come with experience.

, Each walk, increase your walking time by 30 seconds to 1 minute until you are able to sustain a 10-minute walk. Again, do not fret if you can't go longer than the day before. Set the goal and keep at it and you will reach it faster than you think. After reaching 10 minutes, your rate of increasing may slow, but continue trying to increase your walking time by 5 minutes each week.

, Try moving off of the oval and onto the city streets; you will encounter hills and declines, and that will increase the difficulty of your walk.


Continue to find more difficult terrain to work with, eventually working up to hiking up hills and cliffs for the ultimate challenge.

, You can also purchase a heart rate monitor and wear it during your exercise for increased accuracy and precision. If you are under your target heart rate (THR), you need to increase walking speed for it to be beneficial for your health.


Your body won't burn fat unless you reach you THR for a sustained period of time.
When it comes to walking, weight loss and aerobic health will come through sustained effort, not through increased speed or distance.

, Walk at an increased rate for one to two minutes, then slow back to your normal rate for two minutes. Every day or two add an interval until you reach your desired total time, including rest periods. As you become more physically fit, reduce your rest periods until they are down to a minute or less.

Get plenty of calcium.,
Consume calcium through your diet.,
Get plenty of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps improve your bodyâs ability to absorb calcium.Vitamin D also plays a crucial role in bone remodeling.,
Eat protein, but not too much.,
Include magnesium in your diet.,
Eat foods rich in B vitamins.,
Get enough vitamin C. We usually think of calcium when we think âbone,â but your bones are actually made up mostly of collagen.,
Get enough Vitamin K in your diet.,
Donât take vitamin E supplements unless directed by a doctor.,
Monitor your caffeine intake.",How to Build Stronger Bones1," About 99% of the calcium in your body is in your bones and teeth.Itâs important to get enough calcium to grow and maintain healthy, strong bones.Unfortunately, many people -- especially women -- don't get enough calcium in their daily diets.The recommended daily intake of calcium varies depending on your age and sex, but the daily upper limit is between 2,000-2,500mg per day. You shouldnât consume more than this unless instructed by your doctor.Children under age 1 should get between 200-260mg a day. Children under age 3 should get about 700mg of calcium per day. Children from 4-8 should get 1,000mg. Older children and teens need about 1,300mg per day. During childhood and the teen years, your body adds new bone faster than it is removed, so you need extra calcium during these years.Adults under 50 should get about 1,000mg daily, and women over 50 should boost their intake to about 1,200mg daily. All adults over 70 should consume 1,200mg daily.
Your body may start to break down more bone than it replaces after age 20, though it usually starts in your early 30s. Getting enough calcium and other nutrients will help you keep your bones strong.
Calcium is available in dietary supplements, but you should only take these as instructed by your doctor. Too much calcium can cause constipation and kidney stones, among other unpleasant side effects.The two main forms are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate is the cheapest, but it should be taken with food. Calcium citrate can be helpful for those with inflammatory bowel disease or absorption disorders, as it does not require food.Calcium supplements are best absorbed in small doses (about 500mg at a time), several times a day.;
, Getting calcium from the foods you eat is the best way to consume calcium.Many people in the US get most of their calcium from dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, which are very rich sources of calcium.Choose calcium-fortified soymilk, almond milk, and other dairy substitutes. Tofu can also be enriched with calcium. Some juices and other beverages have added calcium, too.
Vegetable sources rich in calcium include turnip and collard greens, Chinese cabbage (bok choy), black-eyed peas, kale, and broccoli.Spinach is healthy, but itâs not as effective as a source of calcium as other greens because its oxalic acid content reduces the availability of its calcium to your body.Canned sardines and canned salmon are excellent sources of calcium because the bones are meant to be eaten. Sardines and salmon are also excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which improve brain health and may contribute to better mood.They also contain vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium.
Particularly for children, choose whole-grain breakfast cereals that have been fortified with calcium and other nutrients. These are a consistent source of calcium because so many people eat these cereals daily with milk. Sugary cereals, though, can promote obesity, so look for cereals that have low sugar.

, Without enough vitamin D, your bones can become brittle and weak. The amount of vitamin D you need varies depending on your age.Infants under 1 year should get at least 400IU of vitamin D. Human breastmilk cannot usually supply enough vitamin D; nutritional rickets can occur in infants who do not get supplemental vitamin D.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you supplement your infantâs breastfeeding with 400IU of vitamin D in an oral solution per day.Children 1 and up and adults should get about 600IU of vitamin D daily. People over 70 should increase this to 800IU daily.Most foods contain little or no Vitamin D. Fatty fish, such as swordfish, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are the best sources of natural vitamin D (and also provide omega-3 fatty acids). Foods like beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks also contain small amounts of vitamin D. Milk and breakfast cereals are commonly fortified with vitamins A and D.Your body synthesises vitamin D when itâs exposed to the ultraviolet rays in sunshine. People with higher levels of melanin have darker skin and produce less vitamin D from sun exposure. To synthesize vitamin D, spend between 5-30 minutes in the sunshine without sunscreen at least twice a week. (Spend less time in the sun if you burn easily, more if you tan more easily.)Regular sun exposure does still elevate your risk of skin cancer, so be wise about your sun exposure.
Vitamin D is also available as a dietary supplement. This may be necessary for vegans and vegetarians who donât consume animal products, as well as those who donât live in an area with much sunshine or have darker skin. It is available in two forms, D2 and D3. Both seem equally potent in regular doses, although D2 may be less potent in high doses. Vitamin D toxicity is rare.

, Your bones are made up mostly of collagen, a protein that forms the structure of the bone that calcium then strengthens.Very low protein consumption may interfere with your bodyâs ability to form new bone.However, too much protein is equally bad for your bones. High-protein diets such as the âAtkins dietâ may be associated with increased risk of weak bones.Your bodyâs protein needs vary depending on your sex and age.Children under 3 should get at least 13 grams of protein per day. Children aged 4-8 should get 19 grams a day. Children between 9 and 13 should get 34 grams a day
Teenagers need more protein than children, and boys usually need more than girls. Young women aged 14-18 should get at least 46 grams a day, and young men aged 14-18 should get at least 52 grams a day.
Adult women should get at least 46 grams of protein a day, although elderly women may need to eat 50 or more to help prevent bone loss.Adult men should get at least 56 grams of protein per day.
High protein consumption can affect your bodyâs ability to absorb calcium. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially those high in potassium, to counteract any of these negative effects.Animal protein that is high in saturated fat, such as red meat and dairy products, can cause health issues if you eat them too often.Healthy diets incorporate protein from a variety of sources, including lean meats, eggs, and vegetables and whole grains.

, Nearly every part of your body needs magnesium to function, but many people donât get enough magnesium in their diets. Between 50-60% of the magnesium in your body is in your bones. The amount of magnesium you need depends on your sex and age.Infants younger than 1 year should get between 30-75mg per day. Children from 1-3 should get 80mg daily. Children aged 4-8 need 130mg per day. Children from 9-13 need 240mg a day.
Teenage boys need 410mg per day. Teenage girls need 360mg. Pregnant teenagers should get at least 400mg daily.
Adult males should get between 400-420mg per day, and adult females should get at least 310-320mg per day.
There are many rich sources of dietary magnesium, including nuts, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Most food that provides dietary fiber will also provide magnesium.
Avocados, potatoes with their skins, and bananas are also good sources of magnesium.
Magnesium competes with calcium for absorption in your body, so if your calcium levels are already low, magnesium may cause a calcium deficiency. Getting enough calcium and magnesium will help keep you and your bones strong and healthy., Vitamin B12 is responsible for many functions in your body, including neurological function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. A vitamin B12 deficiency can reduce the number of osteoblasts in your body; these cells help form new bone when the old tissue has been destroyed.Getting enough B12 will help ensure that your bones are replenished and strong. The amount of B12 you need depends on your age.Infants under 1 year should get between 0.4-0.5mcg per day. Children between ages 1-3 should get 0.9mcg, and between ages 4-8 should get 1.2mcg. Children who are between 9 and 13 years old should get 1.8mcg per day.
Children 14 and older and adults should get at least 2.4mcg of Vitamin B12 daily. Pregnant and lactating women should get slightly more vitamin B12, between 2.6-2.8mcg.
Vitamin B12 is found mostly in animal products and is not generally found in plant foods. Good dietary sources of Vitamin B12 include shellfish, organ meats, beef and red meat, and fish. Fortified dairy products and cereals can also contain B12.Because B12 rarely exists naturally in plant-based food, vegetarians and vegans may find it more difficult to get adequate B12. B12 is also available as a dietary supplement as a capsule or sublingual liquid., This collagen provides a framework that the calcium builds on.Vitamin C has been shown to stimulate procollagen and enhance collagen synthesis in your body. Getting enough vitamin C has many health benefits, including keeping your bones strong.The amount of vitamin C you need depends on your age and sex, but most people get plenty.Infants under 1 year can get sufficient vitamin C from formula or breastmilk. Children 1-3 should get at least 15mg per day. Children 4-8 should get 25mg daily. Children between ages 9-13 need 45mg a day.
Older teens (14-18) need 65-75mg per day. Adult men should get at least 90mg of vitamin C per day, and adult women should get at least 75mg per day.
Pregnant women should get between 80-85mg a day, and breastfeeding women should get between 115-120mg a day.
Excellent dietary sources of vitamin C include Citrus fruits and juices, red and green peppers, tomatoes, kiwifruit, strawberries, cantaloupe, and Brussels sprouts.Cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, spinach, and peas, as well as fortified cereals and other products, are also good sources.
People who smoke should consume at least 35mg more than the daily recommendation. Smoke decreases your bodyâs vitamin C levels.

, Vitamin K increases bone density and strength, reducing your risk of bone fractures and breaks.Most people get enough vitamin K from dietary sources and their gut bacteria, which also produce vitamin K.The daily recommended amount of vitamin K varies by age.Infants under 6 months should get 2mcg per day. Infants 7-12 months should get 2.5mcg. Children between 1 and 3 need at least 30mcg daily. Children between 4-8 should get 55mcg. Children between 9-13 should get 60mcg.
Teenagers need 75mcg daily. Adult males (18+) should get at least 120mcg per day, and adult females should get at least 90mcg per day.
Vitamin K is found in many foods. Good sources include green leafy vegetables such as spinach and broccoli, and vegetable oils, nuts, fruits (especially berries, grapes, and figs), and fermented foods such as Natto and cheese., Vitamin E is an important part of your diet. Itâs an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties and fights free radicals in your body that can cause cell damage. However, vitamin E supplements may provide 100IU or more per dose, much more than the daily recommended intake. Use of vitamin E supplements may decrease bone mass and prevent your body from making new bone tissues effectively, so donât take them without consulting your doctor first.The recommended daily vitamin E intake varies according to your age.Infants under 6 months should get 4mg/6IU daily. Infants 7-12 months should get 5mg/7.5IU. Children between 1 and 3 should get 6mg/9IU daily. Children 4-8 should get 7mg/10.4IU per day. Children 9-13 need 11mg/16.4IU per day.
Children 14+ and adults should get at least 15mg/22.4IU per day. Lactating mothers need slightly more, around 19mg/28.4IU daily.
You can usually get all the vitamin E you need from a well-balanced diet that incorporates fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Good dietary sources of vitamin E should include at least 10% of your daily value and include wheat germ oil, sunflower seeds, almonds, and plant oils. While not as concentrated, other dietary sources of vitamin E include peanuts, broccoli, kiwifruit, mango, tomato, and spinach., Some caffeinated beverages, including colas and coffee, are linked by some studies to bone loss, although the exact relationship is still unclear.Some health experts believe the problem lies in replacing healthier beverages such as milk and juice with cola or coffee.Itâs a good idea for adults to limit their caffeine to 400mg a day or less.Children and youth under 18 should not have caffeine, which has been linked to several health and development issues. Caffeine will not stunt growth in children, but it can cause many other issues including heart palpitations and anxiety.The phosphoric acid in cola may also leach calcium out of bones. Soft drinks like ginger ale and lemon-lime soda that donât contain phosphoric acid are not linked to bone loss, although the sugar in many of these drinks isnât good for you.Some caffeinated beverages, such as black tea, are not associated with bone loss."
"
Avoid âdietingâ unless as recommended by a doctor.,
Watch your alcohol consumption.,
Get at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise every day.,
Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.",How to Build Stronger Bones2," Severe calorie restriction is linked to weaker bones and bone loss. People with anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder in which people severely restrict calories for a long period of time, are at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.Your body needs a certain level of calories and nutrition every day to maintain strong bones and muscles, but many fad diets donât provide a healthy balance.If you need to lose weight, consult your doctor or a professional nutritionist or dietician for a healthy eating and exercise regimen.


People who are extremely thin, whether naturally or through dieting, are also at an elevated risk of osteoporosis., Long-term, heavy alcohol consumption can interfere with bone remodeling. It weakens your bones and increases your risk of fractures and breaks. This is especially true for adolescents who consume alcohol.If you do drink alcohol, do it only in moderation.


The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism states that âlow-riskâ or âmoderateâ drinking is the safest way to avoid negative health effects from alcohol. This is defined as no more than 3 drinks on a given day, and no more than 7 per week for women. For men, itâs no more than 4 drinks on a given day, and no more than 14 per week., People who get regular exercise tend to have stronger, denser bones. Weight-bearing exercise, where your bones have to carry your body weight around, is especially important to building strong bones.Women reach peak bone mass earlier than men do, and they also have a lower bone mass threshold. Exercise is particularly important for women.
Getting regular exercise starting in childhood is the best way to continue healthy habits throughout your life. Encourage children to run around, jump, dance, and play sports.
The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends activities like brisk walking, dancing, aerobics, racquet and team sports, and weight training to help build and maintain bone mass.Jumping as high as you can 10 times twice a day can help strengthen bones, too.Heavy yard work or gardening, skiing, skating, and karate are also good choices.
Exercises such as swimming and biking donât require you to move your body weight around, so while theyâre great as part of an overall fitness plan, theyâre not as good for building bone.
If you have risk factors for osteoporosis or other health conditions, consult with your doctor or a physical therapist to make sure you get an exercise plan that is safe and healthy for you.

, Smoking is incredibly harmful for every part of your body, and your bones are no exception. Smoking interferes with your bodyâs use of vitamin D to absorb calcium and interferes with your bodyâs ability to use vitamin C to create new collagen. Both of these things weaken your bones.In fact, smoking is directly linked to lower bone density.Smoking also lowers estrogen levels in men and women. Estrogen is crucial to helping your bones retain calcium and other minerals.Studies have shown that exposure to secondhand smoke exposure during youth and early adulthood may increase the risk of developing low bone mass later. Keep children and growing youth away from areas with secondhand smoke."

Get enough sleep.",How to Build Up Atrophied Muscles," Muscle atrophy is the medical term used to denote the condition when a part of the body suffers muscle loss or when muscle tissue wastes away.Itâs normal for muscle atrophy to occur as we age, but it can also be a sign of a more serious medical condition, illness, or injury.
Muscle atrophy can negatively impact a personâs quality of life because they lose strength and mobility, which can make it difficult to perform basic tasks. People with atrophied muscles are also at an increased risk for falling or injuring themselves. Since the heart is also a muscle that can break down, individuals experiencing muscle atrophy face the risk of heart problems.;
, Muscles can atrophy from disuse, or when they are not used regularly at an appreciable level of exertion. This disuse causes the muscle tissue to break down, shorten in length, and waste away. This typically occurs as a result of an injury, sedentary lifestyle, or medical condition that prevents a person from exercising his muscles.Disuse muscle atrophy can also result from severe malnourishment. For example, prisoners of war and people suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia may experience muscle loss and the wasting away of muscle tissue.
People with jobs that require them to be seated for major portions of each work day or people who are not physically active can also experience this type of muscle atrophy.
Severe injuries such as those to the spinal cord or brain may leave someone bedridden and result in atrophied muscles. Even common injuries such as broken bones or sprains that restrict your ability to move around can also cause disuse muscle atrophy.
Medical conditions that limit a personâs ability to exercise or be physically active include rheumatoid arthritis, which causes joint inflammation, and osteoarthritis, which weakens the bones. These conditions can make it uncomfortable, painful, or even impossible to exercise, leading to atrophied muscles.
In many cases of disuse muscle atrophy, the loss of muscle tissue can be reversed by increasing physical exercise.

, Neurogenic muscle atrophy is caused by a disease or injury to the nerves attached to the muscles. It is less common than disuse muscle atrophy, but harder to treat because nerve regeneration usually requires more than increased exercise. Some of the diseases that often lead to neurogenic atrophy include:



Polio, a viral disease that can cause paralysis.
Muscular dystrophy, a hereditary disease that weakens the muscles.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, attacks the nerve cells that communicate with and control muscles.Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that causes your bodyâs immune system to attack your nerves, resulting in muscle paralysis and weakness.Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is another autoimmune disease that can immobilize the whole body., Itâs important to recognize the symptoms of muscle atrophy early so you can begin treating your condition. Some of the main symptoms include:Muscle weakness and decrease in muscle size.
Skin around the affected muscle may seem to sag away from the muscle.
Difficulty lifting things, moving the atrophied area, or doing exercise that was once easy.
Pain in the affected area.
Back pain and difficulty walking.
A feeling of stiffness or heaviness in the affected area.
The symptoms of neurogenic muscle atrophy can be harder for someone without a medical background to recognize, but some of the more visible symptoms include a stooped posture, a rigid spine, and a limited ability to move the neck.

, If you suspect that you are experiencing muscle atrophy, itâs a good idea to talk with your doctor or a medical professional as soon as possible. They will be able to properly diagnose your condition and provide treatment for the underlying causes.If the reason for muscle deterioration is an illness, your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that will help you maintain your muscle mass or reverse some damage of muscle atrophy.
Anti-inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids are sometimes given to patients with muscle atrophy, which helps to reduce inflammation and compression of the affected muscle nerves. This can make exercise and daily activities more comfortable.
To diagnose muscle atrophy, doctors often use blood tests, X rays, CT scans, EMG scans, MRI scans, and muscle or nerve biopsies. They may also measure muscle tone and reflexes.A doctor will also be able to talk with you about whether any kinds of exercise can stop the loss of muscle tissues or if you need to undergo surgeries and other kinds of treatments.

, Depending on what is causing the muscle atrophy, your doctor might recommend you work with a physical therapist, nutritionist, or a personal trainer who can improve your condition with targeted exercise, diet, and lifestyle changes.

, Even if the doctor did not find that your muscle atrophy is caused by a specific disease, itâs a good idea to talk with your doctor or health provider before attempting to build up atrophied muscles. You donât want to overdo anything or endanger your health, and your doctor may be able to refer you to a qualified trainer or physical therapist., Though you can do some physical activities on your own to reverse muscle atrophyâs effects, it is always best to have a qualified instructor or trainer to ensure that you are on the right track.


She will start out by assessing your capabilities and guide you through specific exercises to build muscle in the atrophied areas. She can also gauge your progress and adjust the exercise routine as needed.

, Since many people with atrophied muscles are beginning exercise again after a long break from physical activity, itâs important to start slowly. Remember, your body is not as strong as it was prior to atrophy.

, Swimming and water exercises are often recommended for patients who are trying to recover from muscle atrophy because this form of exercise can dull muscle pain, quickly tone atrophied muscles, rebuild muscle memory, and relax sore muscles. While itâs best to work with an expert, here are a few basic steps to get you started:, With water at hip- to waist-height, try walking around the pool for 10 minutes. This workout is low-risk and helps develop the muscles in the lower part of your body.


As you progress, increase the time interval and the depth of the water.
You can also use paddles or water barbells for more resistance. These tools will help work your core and upper body.

, Try a knee lift by positioning your back against the pool wall, and placing both feet flat on the bottom of the pool. Then, lift a knee up as if you are marching in place. When your knee is at hip height, extend it outward.


Keep doing this for ten repetitions, before switching to the other leg.
As you progress, try doing additional sets for each leg.

, Face the pool wall with your arms resting on the deck of the pool and shoulder-width apart. Use your hands to raise your body up out of the water so you are about halfway out of the pool. Hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower yourself back in the pool.


For an easier version, place your hands on the pool deck so they are shoulder-width apart. As you bend your elbows, lean your chest toward the wall of the pool.

, If you feel proficient doing exercises in the water, add some body-weight exercises while on dry land.


A beginner can start with eight to twelve repetitions of the exercise moves mentioned below. These exercises target the major muscle groups.
Perform this routine three times per week to build up atrophied muscles.

, To perform a squat, stand straight and put both hands forward. Slowly and carefully bend your knees, as if sitting in an imaginary chair. Hold this position for a few seconds before going back to the starting position.Keep your weight on your heels and do not allow your knees to go past your toes.

, To perform lunges, stand up straight with your hands on your hips. Pull your abdominal muscles in.Take a large step forward with your right foot. Keep your back straight while moving forward. Your heel should be raised while the tip of the toe is pressing against the floor.
Bend both knees at the same time until they both form a 90 degree angle. You can check your position at the mirror to know if you are doing it right.
Put your heel down and push upwards to stand. Return to the starting position and do all of the above with the left leg.
Remember that your body should not be slouching forward.

, To do a triceps dip, prepare a strong bench or a secured chair. Sit on the bench or chair and place your hands shoulder-width apart along the edge.Slowly slide your butt off the seat with your legs extended in front of you. Straighten your arms to keep tension on the triceps.
Bend your elbows carefully while keeping your back close to the bench. Upon completing this part, press down on the bench to straighten your arms.

, For a basic ab crunch, lie on your back on a mat or a carpeted surface. Bend your knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the floor.You can cross your arms in front of your chest or place your hands behind your neck or head. Try to pull your shoulders towards the ceiling by making use of the force from your abdominal muscles.
Hold the âcrunchedâ position for a few seconds, then lie back down and repeat.

, Make use of resistance tools such as resistance bands or weight machines to help you with your form. You should only move on to these exercises once you can successfully perform the body-weight exercises indicated above. Itâs also a good idea to research specific resistance exercises that target the affected area.Bench presses can be done with resistance bands. Lay down on a bench and push forward while gripping the bands like you are lifting barbells.
Start with lighter-weight bands. If you feel comfortable with the current weight, fold it lengthwise to increase the resistance. Once you feel comfortable, you can move on to heavier-weight bands.

, In addition to the other exercises described in this article, cardio exercise is a good way to build up atrophied muscles. Try establishing a regular walking or cardio routine.Start with ten to fifteen minutes of continuous walking per day. Gradually increase your speed and try to take a 30-minute walk or jog daily.

, After each workout, stretch your muscles to increase their range of motion. Do five to ten minutes of stretching after each workout. You can also perform a separate stretching session.Make sure to perform stretches that target all of the major muscles, and hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds.
Begin with stretching your back and your upper body. Next move on to stretches for your neck, forearms, wrists and triceps. Do not forget your chest, buttocks and groin area before moving to your thighs. Lastly, perform stretches for instep and hamstrings.

, Here are some specific stretching exercises for different parts of the body:Neck stretching: Incline your head forward then stretch your neck to the left, right, back and forward. Do not roll your head from side to side as this practice is dangerous.
Shoulder stretching: Place your left arm on your chest. Grab the forearm with the opposite arm. Pull it until you feel that your shoulder is being stretched. Push the arm you are stretching in the opposite direction to contract the muscles. Do the same steps for the right arm.
Triceps stretching: Start with raising your right arm. Bend the right elbow and reach down behind your head and between the shoulder blades. Make use of the left arm to reach and grab the right elbow. Lastly, pull your elbow toward your head.
Wrist stretching: Simply hold your arm out and slightly pull back your hand with the opposite hand. Do this repetitively.
Hamstrings stretching: Start in a cross-legged sitting position. Put one leg out. Attempt to reach and hold the foot for a few seconds. Go back to the starting position and do the same thing with the other leg.
Lower back stretch: Lie down on your back. Bring one leg up to chest level. Do the same with the other leg.
Leg stretching: Lie down on your back and extend both legs in the air. Grab the back of your thighs and pull the legs toward your face.

, A constant supply of protein is necessary for muscle growth. See the basic guidelines below for daily recommended protein intake based on your age and gender.Adult men should eat about 56 grams of protein per day.
Adult women should eat about 46 grams per day.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should eat at least 71 grams of protein per day.
Teenaged boys should eat about 52 grams a day.
Teenaged girls should eat about 46 grams per day.
Foods rich in protein include turkey breast, fish, cheese, pork loin, tofu, lean beef, beans, eggs, yogurt, dairy products, and nuts.
A nutritionist, personal trainer, or dietician might suggest something other than the recommended dose based on your condition, weight, and activity level.

, If you donât eat sufficient carbohydrates to fuel your body, it will start breaking down muscles instead. This can further aggravate the muscle atrophy in the affected area.To build atrophied muscle, your carbohydrate intake should be at least 45 to 65 percent of your total calorie intake.Try to select carbohydrates that are also full of fiber and do not have a lot of added sugars. These include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plain yogurt, and milk.

, These good fats stop the breakdown of muscle by interfering with the inflammatory process.Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp, and winter squash.
The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is 1 to 2 grams daily, When the body experiences stress, it prepares to respond. This preparation is known as the fight-or-flight response. In this response, many hormone levels shoot up including the stress hormone known as cortisol, which can break down muscle tissue during periods of prolonged stress.Since stress cannot be completely eliminated in our lives, take steps to minimize. Identifying the source of your stress can help you prevent it from occurring. You can also try stress-control techniques such as meditation or yoga. For specific suggestions, talk with a therapist, counselor, or mental-health professional about the stressors in your life.

, When we sleep, our body builds and repairs muscles, so this is an important step to combat muscle atrophy.Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per day.

, Aim for between 1-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For example, if you weigh 180lb, take in at least 81-146g of protein every day.


One ounce (28 grams) of cooked meat contains roughly 7 grams of protein.You could meet an 80 gram daily goal with two 6-oz. steaks, assuming no other protein sources.

, The body needs a sufficient amount of water to build muscle at an optimal rate. Here's a great little formula to help make sure you are getting enough:Imperial units: Bodyweight in lbs X 0.6 = water intake in ounces.
The same formula in metric units: Bodyweight in kg x 40 = water intake in milliliters.
This includes all water from food and drink, not just glasses of water.
If you are over 30, you can lower these numbers to lbs x 0.46 to 0.54, or kg x 30 to 35., Rather than having two or three large meals during the dayâsomething we've grown up withâchange your eating habits so that you are eating five or six smaller meals during the day.


To help keep your protein intake high, one or two of those meals can be a protein shake. Here's one example, though a quick Internet search will uncover hundreds of delicious protein shakes:
8oz skimmed milk
1 banana
1 tbsp peanut butter
2 scoops of protein powder

, That's rightânot only does it make food taste good, fat is good for you, as long as you are eating the right kinds and amounts of fat! Saturated fatsâthe fat you'll find in a stick of butter, a bag of chips, or baconâshould be limited to about 20g or less. That's the bad news. The good news is that unsaturated fats are actually beneficial, even necessary. Fat is necessary for the proper distribution of vitamins A, D, E, and K, helps promote better eyesight, and healthy skin. Depending on your total caloric intake, 50-70g of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat is beneficial for your training, and your overall general health.


Monounsaturated fats can be found in olive, canola, and sesame oils; avocado; and nuts such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pistachios.
Polyunsaturated fats are found in corn, cottonseed, and safflower oils; sunflower seeds and oils; flaxseed and flaxseed oil; soybeans and soybean oil.
Omega-3 fats, an overall winner of a fat that is very beneficial to heart and blood health, eyesight, and for children, brain development. You'll find this fat in many omega-3-enriched foods. Another great source is fatty cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, trout, and sardines.
A good way to determine how much fat in grams you should be taking in is to multiply your calorie intake by 0.001 for maximum trans-fats; by 0.008 for maximum saturated fats; and by 0.03 for the ""good fats"". For example, for a 2,500-calorie diet, you would limit trans-fats to 3g or less, saturated fats to 20g or less, and up to 75g of mono- and polyunsaturated fats.

, In addition to a well-balanced diet, include a multivitamin supplement to your dietary regimen. It will ensure that your body is getting the full amount of vitamins and minerals it needs to stay healthy. There are many options, depending on your age, your sex, and your particular health and diet needs. Find the one that's right for you, and make it part of your daily routine.

, A good diet is required for your body to be able to maximize your potential, but there's no potential at all until you start the process of tearing down your old muscles and rebuilding them bigger, bulkier, and stronger. The best way to do that is to start at the beginning.

, Before you begin any exercise routine, whether it is a simple jog or a 300lb deadlift, start with a low-intensity routine designed to warm up all the muscles you're about to work on. Not only will it help you get into the right frame of mind, it can help prevent injuries.


You should never stretch a cold muscle. Research has shown that pre-workout stretching, contrary to public opinion, does not prevent injury and may, in fact, result in poorer performance. Stretching is best done following a workout.

, Training with high reps is good for building endurance, but it won't help you build up either size or strength. Instead, aim for about 3-8 sets per muscle group, and 6-12 reps per set for your normal routine. Your final rep should be very hard to complete! If it's not, increase the weight you're lifting.


Limit your overall training to about 45 minutes a day.
Every 4-8 weeks, vary your routine. As your body adapts to stress, you'll hit a plateau where the benefits of weight training will begin to diminish. The only way to prevent this from happening is to change things up, such as by increasing weight and changing exercises. Try a week of really piling the weights on, and do six to eight reps per set at the maximum weight you can manage with proper form. The more lifting experience you have, the more often you should vary your routine.

, You'll see the maximum benefit when your entire body is part of the routine. The more muscles you use when training, the more hormones you will produce (including epinephrine and norepinephrine), which in turn stimulates muscle growth both while you exercise and for the entire day.


Give all muscle groups equal attention, such as five sets of rows after five sets of bench presses. This will encourage balanced training, growth, and flexibility.
Compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, and pull-ups use a lot of different muscles.
You can work the entire body in each session, or divide your sessions between, for example, the upper body one day, and the lower body the next.
Don't rush. Advanced lifters often base their routines around a technique called explosive repetition. In other words, they lift a tremendous amount of weight in a short (explosive) amount of time. There are significant benefits to this method, but the risk of injury in novice athletes is high. It is recommended solely for more advanced athletes.

, Good cardiovascular health improves blood flow, a requirement for muscle growth. The standard recommendation is 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week, or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio, or an equivalent combination of the two. Examples of cardio include running, biking, swimming, and any sport that involves constant movement.


Cardio burns calories quickly, so overdoing it can limit the energy available to build your muscles. If you increase the amount of cardio exercise you do, be sure to increase your calories intake as well.

, Your body needs time to recover, and to repair (build) your muscles, and to do that you will need at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Avoid caffeine and alcohol for deeper sleep.


In addition to the proper amount of sleep, do not overdo your training regimen. While you might be tempted to think that ""more is better,"" in fact the opposite is true. You can reach a point known as ""over-training"", in which you'll lose the ability to ""pump"", (engorge the muscles with oxygen-rich blood), and can even lead to muscle wastingâexactly the opposite of what you are trying to achieve. Here are some symptoms to be aware of if you think you may be falling into the over-training zone:

Chronic fatigue
Strength loss
Loss of appetite
Insomnia
Depression
Lowered sex drive
Chronic soreness
Prone to injury



, To avoid over-training, set up a schedule that works for you and your goals. Here is an example of a split routine that gives you plenty of time to break down your muscles, and plenty of time off to let them recover, even larger than before:


Day 1: Chest and biceps, followed by 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio.
Day 2: Back and triceps, followed by 30 minutes of moderate intensity cardio.
Day 3: Legs and abs, followed by 30 minutes of high-intensity cardio.
Day 4: Shoulders
Day 5 â Day 7, rest.

, Whether your stress comes from job, home, or just the way you're wired, do what you can to reduce or eliminate it. It's not just good for you in general, but stress increases the production of the hormone cortisol, a hormone that encourages your body to store fat and burn muscle tissue.

, ""Exploding"" upward while lifting trains your muscles for quick, explosive strength. However, this increases the risk of injury if you do not use the correct technique. If you want to add these to your squats or other range of motion exercises, practice first with a lighter weight and a low-intensity set up:


Work up to the explosive part of the move gradually by starting with a smaller range of motion, and increase it with time and practice.
Move slowly on the eccentric (the lowering phase). This is the part of motion which causes the most tearing, so don't try to ""explode"" downward.
""Load the muscle"" at the low point of the exercise. This means holding the muscle contraction before beginning the movement.
Explode upward quickly, but avoid full extension at the peak range of motion. For example, knees should stay slightly bent for leg exercises, and elbows slightly bent for upper body exercises.

, These exercise build the major muscles of your back, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and teres major:



Perform bent over rows. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, about 6 to 10 inches (15â25 cm) behind the barbell or two dumbbells. Bend slightly at the knees but keep your shins vertical. Bend forward at the waist with your spine and head straight. Lift the weight with an overhand grip up to your lower chest or upper abdomen. Lower slowly until your arms are nearly extended, without touching the ground. 3 x 8.Do pull-ups to build your lats. Jump onto or grab hold of a horizontal bar that is comfortably taller than you. Lift your legs back so that you are hanging from the bar. With your hands shoulder-width apart, and your palms facing toward you, lift your chin up to the bar using only your arms. 3 x 8.

, The bench-press is the most dependable way to gain chest muscle, although there are lots of different exercises for the chest.


Do push-ups. Combine push-ups with other chest exercises, or do them independently. Keep your arms at shoulder-width when you lower yourself down. The closer your hands are to one another, the more you'll work your triceps.
For the bench-press, start with a weight that you can lift comfortably. If you are a beginner, try lifting the bar along with 5lbs or 10lbs on each side. With arms at shoulder-width apart, grab onto the bar and slowly lower the bar until it's at nipple level; push up until your arms are fully extended upwards. Do 8â10 repetitions (reps) like this for three sets (3 x 8), adding additional weight each set. Once you have a few months of practice, slowly increase weight and go down to 6â8 reps per set, aiming to reach muscle failure at the end of the third set.
Lift weights on the incline bench press. The incline is like the bench press, but one end of the bench is tilted about 40 degrees. Do 3 x 8. It will be harder to lift the bar on an incline, so start out with less weight than you would on the flat bench-press.

, Here are four different exercises to build and strengthen your leg muscles. Choose a selection that works your quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings:



Do deadlifts to work the back of the thigh, the glutes and calves. Lift a barbell or two dumbbells from the ground to a standing position, then lowering the weight steadily down again. Keep your back straight and leave your arms extended, engaging your legs and back instead.
Do standard squats with a weighted bar. Place enough weight on a bar and rack so that it's a little lower than shoulder height. It should be heavy enough that doing a squat is difficult, but not impossible. If you're a beginner, this may mean using a bar without any weight to start with. Duck under the bar and stand up so that the bar rests comfortably on your trapezius muscles, just below the neck. Keep your knees slightly bent and your legs slightly wider than shoulder width. Lift the bar up off the rack and move backwards one step.

Slowly bring the weight down by bending your knees. Keep your chest, knees, and feet aligned vertically, with your hips back.
Arch your back slightly but keep your torso as erect as possible, with your head in line with the spine.
Bring your butt down, keeping the tension on the leg muscles. A 90 degree bend at the knees is the safest option. With experience and practice some people can safely lower past the 90 degree bend, but it is not required for perfect form.
Exhale deeply and use your legs and hips, not your back, to lift out of the squat. 3 x 8.


Do front squats with a weighted bar. Rack a weighted bar at just-below shoulder-level. Come up to the bar from the front, positioning the bar on the front shoulders. Cross your arms over onto the bar and walk it out. Keeping your back straight, bend your legs into a squat, with your hips under the bar. Lift and repeat 3 x 8.
Do Belgian squats (or ""single leg squats"") with a dumbbell. Hold out in front of your chest a dumbbell using both hands. Standing in front of a bench, lift your right leg back so that it's parallel to the floor and resting comfortably on the bench. Bend into a squat using the left leg, so that the right knee almost hits the floor. Lift and repeat 3 x 8. Repeat using opposite leg.

, Dumbbell arm curls are one of the most effective way to improve strength in your biceps. As with all exercises, build muscle by steadily increasing the weight you lift.


Do individual arm curls with dumbbells. Sit down on a bench and grab onto a dumbbell on the ground, with your hand in between your thighs. With your elbow resting on your thigh, lift the dumbbell all the way to the upper chest by curling your arm upward. Switch to the opposite hand and repeat. 3 x 8.
Do arm curls on a weighted bar. Standing up, grab hold of a weighted bar with both hands. Let the arms extend all the way down to the thighs. Using only your arms, lift the weight up to your chest by curling your arms upward. 3 x 8.

, Dips are probably the most effective way to work your triceps, which is the muscle beneath your biceps. You'll need to have strong triceps to bench-press large amounts of weight.


To do dips, place your hands at shoulder-width apart on a bench, with your body and feet stretched out in front of the bench. Slowly bend your elbows and lower your body down so that your butt nearly touches the floor. Lift back up with your arms to starting position; repeat, doing 3 x 8. If this isn't a high-intensity set for you, increase the resistance by lifting one foot off the floor.
Alternately, you can do a chest dip on a dip machine, grabbing hold of two beams, bending your feet back off the ground, and lowering your body until your knees nearly touch the ground. Lift back up with your arms until they are straight.
Do skull crushers. Lay down flat on a bench with a bar. Bend your elbows so that the bar is about a couple inches from your forehead. Slowly push the bar up until your arms are fully extended before bringing the weight back down. Keep your elbows close together. Repeat 3 x 8.

, Hold a barbell or two dumbbells at chest or shoulder height, with your palms facing forward. Lift the weight above your head until your arms are fully extended, with a slight bend in the elbow to prevent hyperextension. 3 x 8.


Variations include changes to the hand and palm position, lifting the dumbbells until they touch overhead, or lifting into a wide ""Y"" shape with your arms.

, Your abs define the muscles on your stomach, giving you that chiseled 6-pack look. There are a variety of exercises that work out your abdominals. Here are a couple.


Do standard/oblique crunches. Lie down on a mat and position both arms behind your head without locking the hands. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the ground. Pushing the small of your back into the ground, slowly roll your shoulders off the ground only a couple of inches (not to a full sitting position). Don't use your momentum to help you up; use slow, regulated movements. Repeat 3 x 20.

For oblique crunches, angle your torso so one shoulder reaches toward the opposite knee. Alternate sides after each crunch.


Do planks to work the abs and the core. Lie face-down on the floor. Lift yourself up so that your body is still parallel to the floor, with your forearms (flat on the floor) and your toes supporting your weight. Keep your body straight and hold your position for as long as possible.

Make sure that you set up in a quiet place, and in an area with enough space for movement. If you do not have a Pilates mat, try doing the exercise on a carpeted area or use a towel.Use a thicker mat if you have a sensitive back.
Try to find a well lit space with natural light.Wear comfortable clothing that allows movement. Shoes and socks are not needed.;
, Push your chin into your chest, ensuring your neck remains long. Press your back flat against the floor. Make sure it is not in a neutral position.A neutral back position allows you to maintain the natural curve of your spine while lying down. The flat position you want to achieve with your back is called an imprinted spinal position., Do not use too much force while keeping your shoulders pressed down. Pull them away from your ears, and allow your arms to rest next to your body. Place your hands palm-down on the mat, fingertips stretched towards the bottom of the mat.

, Raise your legs upwards until they are vertically above your hips, forming a 90 degree angle with your body. Keep your upper thighs and knees together. Point your toes towards the ceiling. , Inhale and scoop your abdominals inwards, while pressing your hands into the mat. Think about pressing your navel to your spine. Use your muscles to scoop your abdominals inwards, rather than âsucking in.âDo not attempt this exercise alone if you have limited Pilates experience.

, Slowly lift your hips, placing your legs above your head, parallel to your body and the floor. Point your toes out towards the top of the mat. Do not let your legs touch your face., Inhale and lift your legs. Keep your legs together, and move your legs to the right side of your body. You should only take your legs slightly to the right, not too far to the ground.Always remember to breathe steadily while performing this exercise.

, Exhale and allow your legs to come back down. Bring them down until they reach a 45 degree angle with the mat. Keep your thighs and knees pressed together as you bring your legs down. Bring your legs down slowly, using your muscles. Do not let them drop.

, Inhale deeply once again. Lift your legs slowly, using your muscles. Bring your legs parallel to the floor, and to the left side of your head this time.Exhale and bring your legs back down to the 45 degree angle with the floor, and repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.

, Each sequence should consist of just a few repetitions. Repeat each of the exercises in a sequence three to five times. The amount of exercises you do in a sequence depends on your level of experience and health.Donât push yourself. If you feel that the exercise is becoming overwhelming, stop or take a break.

, To stretch out your abs, lie flat on your back, extend your arms above your head, and stretch your legs away from your torso. Hold as long as you feel a good stretch. Donât force your body too much. The stretch should relieve the tightness from performing the crunches.You can also try childâs pose to stretch out. This consists of sitting on your heels, bringing your stomach to your thighs, and stretching your arms out in front of you., Perform the same number of sequences each time until you feel ready to add additional sequences. To start feeling results, aim to do at least three sequences three days a week. For faster results, increase the number of times per week you do this exercise.

, Traditional Pilates involves working through a sequence of moves, and the goal is to perform each move one time correctly, concisely, and with control. One great way to improve your form and to learn other complementary exercises is to attend a class or take lessons. With time and practice, you can learn how to perform the corkscrew properly using the method of Joseph Pilates.


Concentrate on perfecting your technique rather than doing numerous repetitions.

, The purpose of the Pilates mat is to help support and cushion your body as you do exercises on it, so it is important not to get a mat that is too thin.

, Measure your height and body width to check against a mat's dimensions at the store or when reading product details online. If possible, lie down on the mat to see how it accommodates your body.

, Touch the mat if you can to see how it feels and whether it will provide you with a good grip. Find a mat that will prevent you from slipping or sliding as you exercise and may perspire.

, This may be important if you do Pilates at a gym or other location where you need to bring your own equipment or simply want to put away your mat after exercising. Consider getting a mat that can be rolled up or carried by a strap.

, The extra thickness can give you more support and protection against potential injuries. You may want to have a mat made of foam underneath a thin mat.

, Certain mats may be manufactured and marketed for either Pilates or yoga, but you can try using a combination of both types in your Pilates workouts.

, This may be an option if you are taking classes at a Pilates studio that provides equipment for their students. By using different mats, if offered, you can decide which ones you prefer.

Youâll want to look for training programs that are geared towards group certification.Most training programs are catered for certification to teach group exercise classes.;
, If you like working with one individual to manage and achieve goals, you should look into becoming certified to teach privately.Not all pilates instructor certifications will also include specific training on how to work with individual clients, so make sure you look for a certification that also addresses this.
Some pilates studios or gyms will provide you with a client list, while others will expect you to build your client base yourself.You can work with individual clients on the side, if you also enjoy instructing group classes.

, If youâve got a background in physical therapy or sports medicine, you may want to look into becoming a Pilates specialist. You can teach courses for those in rehabilitation or for athletes.You can also get certified to teach special courses, such as pre or postnatal courses, without already having a speciality degree.

, Think about whether you want to be a basic mat instructor or if youâd like to be certified to teach more advanced courses. If youâre newer to Pilates, youâll be more comfortable becoming a basic mat instructor before tackling more advanced certifications.

An example of a more advanced training certificate would be one that also includes reformer Pilates.
If youâre wanting basic training, most training programs are 40-50 hours. For more advanced training, youâll be expected to put in 500 hours of training.The higher your level of certification, the more youâll be paid to teach once youâre hired.

, There are many programs offered through private studios, but not all of them are of good quality. Look for programs that are accredited by institutions, such as the National Commission for Certifying Agencies, the National Exercise Trainers Association, or the American Fitness Professionals and Associates.


Where you obtain your Pilates fitness instructor certification will influence your future job search outcome after training. If youâre looking to work at a competitive studio, make sure your certification is one theyâll accept.
Ask other Pilates instructors about their training and for their recommendations., Pilates certification is a big time commitment so choose a certification that works for your life. Many programs offer intensive courses over the summer if youâve got free time. You can also look into online training programs that allow you to complete the certification on your own time., Pilates certification courses can range from a couple hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. Decide what youâre willing to spend to become the type of Pilates instructor youâre most interested in, and then let that be a deciding factor when choosing programs., After youâve scoped out a few programs, contact them to see if you can set up an informational meeting to find out more about their process. This allows you to determine whether youâll feel at home in their studio.


This gives you a chance to see their studio in person and see what sorts of equipment they use.
Ask to observe one of their instructorâs classes. This provides you with an opportunity to see if you like their instruction style since thereâs so little consistency in Pilates techniques.

, Understand any prerequisites that must be accomplished, and consider the total cost of training before you make a commitment.


Many pilates certifications, for example, require an anatomy foundation class., Before you begin looking for a position, update your resume to include all of your qualifications and certifications, any experience teaching, and any relevant health and fitness education., Since the Pilates market is thriving, you can likely find either fulltime or part time positions. However, part time positions are more abundant.

You can teach fulltime or part time regardless of whether youâre working with group classes or individual clients.

, Most job search engines, such as LinkedIn, have postings for private or group pilates instructors., If youâre looking for something local, call the studios in your city to see if theyâre hiring. If so, send them your resume.

Even if theyâre not currently hiring, go ahead and ask if you can send them your resume to have on file for when they do decide to hire in the future.

, If youâre so inclined, open your own pilates studio and manage your own staff of instructors.Of course, you can also teach classes when you have time! Owning your own studio will give you the flexibility to teach whenever and how often you like.
Be weary that you need a decent amount of capital to start your own business.

, Most programs require continuing education accreditation to maintain a Pilates instructor position. Make sure you keep up with your certification to maintain your current position or so that youâre able to easily find another one."

For example, for individuals with physical injuries, Pilates has been a tried a true method of reducing physical pain and recovering from injury.Yoga, on the other hand, has been often used as part of mental and emotional rehabilitation.Yoga can be an excellent exercise for rehabilitation, sometimes better than pilates depending on your particular needs. A very experienced, knowledgable yoga instructor can help you build strength and flexibility, choose exercises that fit your abilities, and how to modify exercises if you need to.
Yoga classes can vary a lot, depending on the focus, teacher, or yoga studio. There are classes designed for chair-bound seniors in nursing homes, meditative yoga, yoga for preschoolers, and classes that Olympic-caliber athletes attend. Pilates is not quite as diverse in its presentation.;
, Yoga and Pilates are both wonderful for toning and strengthening all of the muscles groups in your body. Pilates tends to have a greater focus on muscle toning. For example, if you are trying to lose weight, you could try Pilates exercises using different Pilates machine which add the cardio and fitness element to your Pilates poses and will help you to burn additional calories. There are no machines in yoga practice., Yoga has been known to have a lot of beneficial effects on mental health. Doing yoga will calm your sympathetic nervous system, helping with stress, and your hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, which controls hormone levels., Yoga is an ancient practice that often involves exploring spirituality. Mediation is a large part of yoga. Yoga and Pilates involve the alignment of the body and the mind, but Pilates will not add focus on the spirit to this unlike yoga.On the other hand, yoga can also be done without a large focus on spirituality, if that's not your thing. When it comes time to choose a class, if yoga interests you but spirituality does not, you can look for a more secular yoga class.

, You might find it beneficial in your deciding process to research online on the origins of yoga and Pilates.Some of the main points of interest include:


Yoga started over 5000 years ago in India. What is colloquially referred to as yoga is actually part of a larger philosophy and way of life. It was invented to promote a better understanding of oneself and the alignment of the mind, body, and spirit.
Pilates was invented in the early 20th century as a method of body rehabilitation and strengthening. It started as a tool to rehabilitate World War I soldiers, but it took off when dancers started using it to increase their dancing performance.

, Yoga and Pilates are similar in a lot of ways. They both include movements and poses intended to increase strength, flexibility, and the mind body connection. Ultimately though, yoga is a practice focused on your mind and how you feel, with strength and flexibility coming as a side effect. Pilates is a practice focused on toning your body and bettering your posture and movement.,


With Pilates, the breath is used more as a technique of providing the muscles with the energy they need to exercise effectively. Concentrating on the breathing technique throughout Pilates will help you to manage the quantity of oxygen coming into the body and travelling to the muscles to help them become more relaxed.
In yoga, the breathing exercises help you to achieve relaxation. Throughout yoga routines it is important to continuously concentrate on how the breath is being employed. Sending the breath to areas that may be tight or are holding stress can help to relax these specific muscle groups in your body.

, One of the main differences between yoga and Pilates is that yoga can be used for improving the flexibility of the body and it will also gradually increase the flexibility of your joints. Stretching and holding static poses is a central theme in yoga. Pilates is more dynamic, and while flexibility will improve in Pilates, it's not a focus., Pilates focuses on trying to relax muscles which are tense and provide strengthening of the numerous muscles of the body. Unlike yoga, Pilates includes the use of resistance machines in addition to mat exercises, making it much more similar to weight training than yoga is.Yoga and Pilates both contain several poses that are suitable for toning the abdominal muscles. However, Pilates exercises are a lot more intense and results may be achieved much quicker than they might be if practicing yoga. Through frequent Pilates exercises, a flatter and firmer stomach can be achieved.

, Understand that yoga will focus on your mind more. Exercise has been proven helpful for individuals who are suffering from depression or anxiety. Yoga might be the most effective exercise to combat the illness because it focuses on the mind and spirit as well as the body. Quiet reflection and meditation are a large part of yoga practice. Many people start yoga with reducing stress as their main goal., Although it's impossible to get the full Pilates experience at home, you can get an idea of what it's like. Perhaps the best way to get started with Pilates at home is to use Youtube. Youtube has a wealth of free videos of instructors giving beginner lessons in basic Pilates exercises.One thing you can't get out of home pilates exercise is the use of machines, so keep that in mind.

, Nothing more is needed for yoga than some space and free time, which makes it a great exercise to get started with at home. You may find purchasing a mat to be helpful but it's not necessary. Search online for instructions on how to perform basic poses and postures. There are many video as well as text tutorials that will allow you to get a feel for what yoga practice is like., If you wish, you can continue to practice yoga or pilates at home, without ever stepping foot in a class. However, finding a good class might help you get the full yoga or pilates experience, and get the most out of the exercise. Search online to find classes near you. Compare the prices and the reviews. Then choose a few check out in person.Once you arrive at a yoga or Pilates studio you're interested in trying out, talk to the instructor about your goals and what you're looking for in a class. This will help you decide what class is right for you., If you haven't yet decided for sure whether yoga or Pilates is what you want to do, spend some time at classes for both. Look for classes that offer free trials, or free classes for newcomers. Attend a quality yoga class and a quality Pilates class a few times each and by then you should be able to make a fully informed decision on which will better serve your needs."

Communicate your intentions and speech in an excellent way.,
Communicate well through phone messages too.,
Take and Be Proactive in your initiative.,
Keep up the positive attitude and always anticipate things to happen in advance.",How to Be an Efficient Executive Assistant," Vocalize everything properly. Youâre on the front line, you are the company! Always remember that to all outside callers, you are the company.For internal calls, you are an extension of your boss and represent the department.


When you answer the phone, speak from your throat, not your nose. You never want to shriek or soundÂ  shrill to callers. Imagine hearing the voice of Fran Drescher from the TV show The Nanny when calling the President of a major corporation. Not the greatest first impression!

(For those who arenât familiar with this sitcom from the nineties, The Nanny, played by Fran Drescher had en extremely nasal and shrill voice. Practice a few times into a mini cassette until you hear (and feel) the difference. When your voice sounds throaty and velvety smooth, youâve got it.

;
, There is certainly nothing wrong with taking a thorough message (time, date, name and telephone number) on a carbon message pad if that is what you or your executive prefers.Â  Using lightly-colored paper, you will type your executive's name and date at the center-top of the page and under that a column for the callerâs name and message.Â  When someone calls, youâll type the callerâs name, phone number and message, print it out and give it to the executive.Â  Of course, if your boss is not at the desk at the time, you may continue to add names to the log until he/she returns to the office.Â Give your boss the log so he/she can begin reviewing messages and promptly return calls. As your boss returns calls, he/she will cross out the names of everyone whoâs calls have been returned.


Periodically (you decide when), you will go in to get the old log where your boss has crossed out the names of people whoâs calls were returned.Â  You will update the log by shading the names of the people that he/she has called back. You do this by highlighting OR striking through the entire line (name, message and all), clicking on âFormatâ and then âshadingâ then choosing one of the lighter shades of gray and clicking âOKâ or use the strike through method.Â Do this on your computer to each name that your boss has crossed out, leaving alone the names of those that were not crossed off.Â  Now the log on your screen has some names shaded, some not shaded and any new calls that came in.Â 
Print this sheet and give it back to your boss.Â  At a glance, your boss will be able to see everyone who called, including those whoâs calls were returned and those that must still be called back.Â You will be doing this all day long.Â 

,


Go into the office with pen and paper and and excuse yourself for interrupting.Â  Say to your boss âPardon me for interrupting, but I notice it is almost past lunch time and I was wondering if you would like me to pick up a couple of sandwiches for you (both).âÂ  This is where your pen and paper come in handy.Â  Remember when taking sandwich orders, to ask if they want ketchup or mustard and what kind of bread, if it wasnât made clear.Â  Your boss will happily break out a $20 bill and youâre off to get lunch.Â  Often times, when you take this proactive measure, if you have not had lunch, your boss will likely offer to buy yours as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation.
Upon returning with the bag, donât just dump it down on the desk and leave.Â  Find a clear spot away from any papers that may be spread out and place each personâs sandwich and drink and napkins, down onto the desk. Tell your boss that youâre putting his change with the receipt on his desk and ask if thereâs anything else you can get them.Â  They will likely thank you, say no and commence to diving into their sandwiches. Take the empty bag with you and toss it out in your trash can.

, Does your boss do something consistently enough that you can get a good idea of what he/she will need or ask for?Â  This is an extremely valuable skill to master if there are some constants in your bossâ job. These things may include typing up personal letters that your executive commonly asks you to do, or to make certain special plans at certain lunch places that he likes the most. phone calls he would normally ask only you to make.

Find a local class.,
Buy a Pilates mat.,
Warm up with imprinting.,
Stabilize your shoulders with the ""arm reach and pull"" exercise.,
Start with the Hundred.,
Do leg and spine stretches.,
Include rolling exercises.",How to Do Pilates Without a Reformer1," Especially if you've never done any form of Pilates before, your first exposure to the practice should be in a formal class supervised by a certified and experienced Pilates instructor.Generally, mat classes are more common than classes with reformers, owing to the fact that reformers are expensive investments. Mat classes typically also cost less than reformer classes, which can be as much as $90 for an hour-long private session.
You may even be able to find a mat class at a gym that doesn't have reformer classes â and if you're already a member of the gym, you may not have to pay extra for Pilates mat classes.
Mat classes can end up being fairly large. Look for smaller sessions so you can have individualized attention from the instructor.
Make sure the instructor is certified and experienced. Talk to current or former students to find out more about the class before you sign up. You also might want to ask if you can watch a class to get a better understanding of the instructor's style and decide if the class is right for you.;
, A Pilates mat is essential if you want to do Pilates without a reformer. Gyms may provide mats for people who are taking a class, or you may be expected to bring your own. You'll also need a mat if you plan to practice at home, so it's a good idea to go ahead and get one.A Pilates mat is about the same size as a yoga mat, but approximately twice as thick. You may see different thicknesses offered, but you should make sure you buy one that's at least one quarter-inch thick to adequately cushion pressure points as you go through your moves.
Expect to pay at least $20 (USD) for a quality Pilates mat.Some mats can cost as much as $200 (USD).

, Many beginning pilates classes start the same way, using the same warm-up exercises to get your mind and body ready for a challenging workout. One of the first of these warm-up exercises is ""imprinting,"" which helps you relax into your body and lengthen your spine.Begin by lying on your mat on your back. Your arms should be by your sides, your knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor. Keep your spine neutral and slowly relax your body, starting with your shoulders, your jaw and throat, and your ribcage. Continue down your body, relaxing your abdominal muscles, your spine, and finally your hips and legs. Ultimately you'll only be using as much energy as is required to keep your legs up.
Having your back pressed to your mat using your abdominals will help you create a good foundation for the rest of your practice.
Visualize your spine lengthening and pressing its imprint against the mat. This is where the exercise gets its name. Breathe deeply, and focus on creating a balanced imprint. You can imagine seeing an even imprint where your body was if you stood up, with no parts darker than the other.
Hold this posture for at least three to five breaths after you've fully relaxed to get the full benefit of this warm-up in your routine.

, While most Pilates exercises concentrate on your core and lower body, it also is important to make sure that your shoulders and upper body are stabilized and prepared for the correct positions.Stand with good posture with your arms out in front of you, parallel to the floor and palms facing the ground. Inhale and reach forward a few inches, moving your shoulder blades away from each other.
Exhale and move your shoulders to a neutral position with your arms still extended.
Inhale and pull your arms back, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
Exhale and return your arms and shoulders to the starting position. Repeat this exercise between three and five times.
This exercise can also be used over the course of daily life to ease neck and shoulder tension and improve your posture.

, Once you've finished your warm-up, you're ready to move into your Pilates routine. The Hundred is the exercise that starts most any beginning Pilates class. It also helps warm-up your lungs and abdominal muscles.To begin, lie on your back on your mat. Your legs should be bent in tabletop position â thighs perpendicular to the floor and shins parallel to the floor, so that they look like a tabletop. Then, take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, and exhale.
As you exhale, bring your head up to gaze down your body, keeping your chin down. Use your abdominal muscles to curl your upper spine off the floor. Make sure your shoulders are down and engaged. Inhale in this position.
Exhale, deepening the pull of your abs as you extend your arms and legs in front of you. Your arms should be straight, reaching toward the wall in front of you with your palms down, facing the mat. Keep them low, just a few inches off the mat. Your legs should extend and straighten up to where the ceiling and the wall in front of you meet. The lower your legs are, the more challenging this exercise is.
Take five short breaths and five short breaths out while you hold this position, pumping your arms up and down as you do. Repeat this sequence of five inhales and five exhales for a total of 10 times. This is where the exercise gets its name because five plus five times 10 equals 100.
Keeping your spine curved, pull your knees toward your chest. Grasp your knees as you roll your upper spine and head back down to the floor.

, Pilates includes a number of classic leg and spine stretches that you can do without a reformer.These give you a good stretch while also helping to build strength. Some great leg and spine stretches to try include:


Single-leg stretches
Double-leg stretches
Swan pose
Spinal twist

, Rolling exercises are a unique part of the Pilates regimen that stimulate your spine as well as helping you practice coordinating your breath and movement. While these exercises may look strange to you if you're new to Pilates, they are powerful abdominal exercises that teach you how to use your abdominal muscles to stabilize and support your spine.To do a rolling exercise, start by sitting with your legs and arms extended straight out in front of you. Then, slowly begin to lean back, and bend your knees as you do so. Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor, arms raised overhead, and fingertips reaching away from the head. Then, slowly raise your arms, head, chest, and abdominals until you are sitting up again. Lower your knees back down to the floor as you do this. Then, repeat the exercise six to eight more times.Try to raise yourself up and lower yourself down one vertebra at a time, as if you are picking up or putting down a pearl necklace one pearl at a time.
Be sure to check with your doctor before you start rolling exercises. Ideally, you'll roll on your Pilates mat. You shouldn't roll on the hard floor or on a mattress or other surface that's too soft.
Make sure you have enough room to complete your rolls without running into anything or injuring yourself.
You may want to do rolling exercises with an experienced friend or certified Pilates instructor to make sure you're doing them correctly and not putting yourself at risk for injury.
While doing rolling exercises, make sure your abdominal muscles are doing the work of starting and supporting the movement â not your back.

Take some classes on how to be a professional interpreter.,
Have a phone line just for interpreting purpose only.,
Create a quiet, organized working space.,
As you interpret, write down certain information because you might be asked to repeat back to clarify what was stated.,
Interpret verbatim but keep in mind that in certain languages, the word-for-word approach ends up confusing and nonsensical.,
Don't assume, guess, or have preconceived notions about people or issues being interpreted.,
Always be courteous, neutral, and calm regardless of attitudes of other parties involved in the interpreting process.,
Continually educate yourself.,
Maintain good working relationships with interpreting agencies.",How to Be a Successful Phone Interpreter," Becoming certified is even better. There are rules and proper methods to interpreting. Without some training, you will likely make many mistakes and that means complaints about you and no more calls from your interpreting agency.;
, Good to have three-way calling capability as this need comes up time to time and increases your chance of getting more work.

, You don't want dogs barking or kids crying in the background while you are on the phone.

, Afterwards, it would be wise to shred sensitive information you may have gotten while interpreting. Also, any information you interpret is confidential so don't share it with anyone such as a friend or a family member.

, If a word or phrase is unfamiliar, do not guess or skip it. Although an interpreter may be afraid to come across incompetent, it's the best policy to acknowledge what you don't know and ask for explanation. Most people are nice and understanding... even the attorneys!

, This is essential to being a neutral, fair, and effective interpreter.

, After all, you are dealing with people and they may have those ""bad mood"" days. Sometimes, you may interpret for people who have been involved in traumatic auto accidents. That means high emotions are normal occurrences.

, Learn new terms and developments in the field (e.g., medical, legal, corporate, etc.) you specialize in or other areas, as it makes you more marketable.

, Be dependable and honest. Be available and be on time for appointments. Remember, they hire you and pay you.

Use resistance bands.,
Find a Pilates ""magic circle."",
Add light hand weights.,
Buy a balance ball.",How to Do Pilates Without a Reformer2," Therabands or resistance bands provide similar levels of resistance to the straps and pulleys of a Pilates reformer at a fraction of the cost. Many reformer moves can be adapted for mat practice using resistance bands.Resistance bands are especially beneficial when doing footwork exercises such as leg extensions and bends. For example, you can use a resistance band to intensify a leg extend and bend, bird feet, and point and flex exercises.To do bird feet with resistance bands, lie on your back, lift your legs up, and bend your knees so that your legs are at 90 degree angles. Loop the resistance bands around the bottoms of your feet and hold the other ends of the bands in your hands. Then, slowly lift your up your head as if you are going to do a crunch. Arch your feet slightly around the resistance bands and extend your legs straight up and out at a roughly 45 degree angle from your torso. Inhale as you do this. Then, slowly pull your legs back in and exhale. Repeat this exercise three more times.You can use resistance bands to intensify Pilates exercises that require you to extend or separate your arms or legs. For example, you could do a plie while holding a resistance band and you will get some extra resistance when you spread your arms out for the plie.To make this a Pilates exercise, contract your muscles from your feet all the way up through your legs, glutes, and vertical back. Hold the band in tension to draw the muscle contraction higher up into your upper back. Extend your head and neck straight reaching up through your crown.
Bands typically cost between $5 and $15 (USD), depending on their length and strength. You can find sets at sporting goods stores and many discount stores.
You also may want to buy handles, which will help you get a better grip on the band and enable you to do other exercises.
One benefit of resistance bands is that they are small and easily transportable, so you can take your Pilates workout with you when you travel.

, Many Pilates exercises can be done with the magic circle, an exercise implement created by Joseph Pilates, the founder of the practice. A magic circle is a flexible metal or rubber ring approximately 13 inches in diameter.The magic circle provides moderate resistance. If you're a stronger, more muscular person, make sure to choose one of the heavier models that will provide the appropriate level of resistance to give you a strength challenge.
Keep in mind that these can be expensive. You typically can purchase a magic ring for between $20 and $60 (USD) from sporting goods stores or Pilates specialty shops. The price will vary depending on the brand and the materials from which the magic circle is made.The standing leg press is a good beginning move to do with a Pilates magic circle. Stand with good posture, your shoulders and neck relaxed. Place the padded sides of your Pilates magic circle just above your ankle bones. Shift your weight to one foot, pulling up through the middle and engaging your inner thighs. Squeeze the ring in, then slowly release. Do this three times, standing tall and moving with control. Then return to standing and repeat the press three times on the other leg.You can also do side-lying leg presses using the Pilates magic circle. The movement is much the same as the standing leg press, only you are lying on your side. You may want to try this first if you have difficulty balancing properly while standing.
To intensify the 100 exercise, hold the magic circle between your knees or ankles.

, Although they're not necessarily convenient for travel, dumbbells or hand and ankle weights also can add resistance to the Pilates movements you do without a reformer. The extra weight will increase the strength-building aspects of Pilates, as well as increasing your stability and control.Dumbbells aren't as useful as ankle weights that strap onto your legs. Since most Pilates movements focus on your core and lower body, there are few movements for which holding dumb bells would make any difference.
You typically can buy adjustable ankle weights for between $10 and $50 (USD) at sporting goods stores. Look for weights that you can strap around your wrists or your ankles. Some of the cheaper ones have removable sand bags so you can adjust the amount of weight, but the higher end ones have little pockets which fit removable lead bars.
A medicine ball is also a good option. For example, you could try holding a medicine ball while doing the swan pose or while doing roll ups.Avoid using more than six or seven pounds of weight.

, You can find a balance ball, also known as an exercise ball or stability ball, at nearly any discount or sporting goods store for around $20 (USD). Many of the movements using a reformer in Pilates can also be performed on a balance ball.For example, you can do Pilates roll ups with a balance ball, side planks, or bridge exercises.


Doing exercises on the balance ball puts your body in an altered position, which will increase your balance and agility. The ball also raises you off the floor to allow greater extension and flexion of your spine. This enables core exercises to be more challenging.
A balance ball will take up some floor space in your home (unless you plan on deflating it after every session), but it's lightweight enough to easily roll it into a closet and out of the way when not in use.
Many balance balls also come with videos that you can use to become more familiar with this apparatus and start using it for regular workouts.

Talk to someone who has experience with Pilates.,
Start with back-to-back exercises.,
Do double-leg stretches.,
Move to an elephant/handstand.,
Do supported bridges and planks.,
Close with a duo shell stretch.",How to Do Pilates Without a Reformer3," Partner Pilates is a way to do Pilates without a reformer. You and your friend provide resistance for each other as you make your way through the exercises.You can do partner Pilates on your own, or sign up for a class. Many Pilates studios have partner or duet classes, and you typically save a little money versus private classes.
Especially if you plan to do partner Pilates on your own, make sure you choose a friend who is relatively fit and has taken Pilates classes before. While they don't have to be an expert, if you've never done Pilates before and you partner with a friend who also is inexperienced, you should work with a certified instructor.
With partner Pilates, one person acts as the base and the other person is the balancer. Choosing a friend who's roughly the same size as you can be ideal because it gives you the opportunity to switch positions so you both get the same benefit out of the exercises.

, A back-to-back exercise such as ""connecting the spines"" provides an effective warm-up that will get you both centered for your practice as well as allowing you to get in tune with your partner.To do the ""connecting the spines"" exercise, you and your partner sit cross-legged on the floor with your backs to each other. Press against each other with good posture, feeling your own spine against that of your partner's.
You also can mirror movements. One of you leads in bending or rolling forward or backward. The two of you move as though your spines are glued together. Take turns leading this exercise.
Spend several minutes in this exercise, finding a common breathing pattern and connecting with your partner. This connection will assist you in the rest of your exercises.

, Double-leg stretches allow you and your partner to bend and extend your legs while providing each other with resistance, much like the resistance you would experience if you did similar exercises on the reformer.Both you and your partner lie on the floor in a line, pressing the soles of your feet together. Both of you should flex your core. One of you starts with your legs bent and pressed in towards your body, your hands on your shins. The other partner will extend their legs outward and their arms straight overhead.
Your upper spines should be curved in a ""C"" position. Take care to make sure this curve doesn't extend beyond your shoulders. Keep your shoulders neutral and your backs flat against the floor.
Inhale when your legs are pulled toward your chest, and take turns bending and stretching the legs. Exhale when your legs are extended.
Throughout this exercise, you and your partner will alternate positions and breaths. Your movements should be smooth, as though you are moving as one body.

, When you do the elephant/handstand, have the person with greater hamstring and back flexibility serve as the base. The other will be the balancer. If you both are of relatively equal flexibility, you can each take a turn at each position.The base should go into downward-dog position. The balancer places their feet at the base of the base's spine and their hands on the floor, so they are doing a modified handstand. Viewed from the side, it will look like there's an ""L"" shape between your two bodies.
From here, you have several options depending on your strength, flexibility, and overall level of fitness. You can simply hold the position and breathe deeply before releasing, or you and your partner can simultaneously lift one leg up.
After lifting one leg, you can pulse it 20 times to work your glutes, or you and your partner can both do push-ups. You also can do push-ups without lifting your legs., For supported bridges and planks, make sure the larger of the two of you serves as the base, since the balancer will be balancing their entire weight on the base. If you're of equal weight, you can alternate positions.In a supported bridge, the base lies on their back and places their feet at the base of the balancer's spine. The balancer will hold the base's hands. The base slowly raises their legs and extends their arms overhead, giving the balancer a deep back stretch. The base can bend and straighten their legs to do legwork. The balancer also can lift their legs to work their lower abdomen.
For supported planks, the base will need to first get into a full plank position. The balancer will then get on top of the base, placing their hands on the base's heels and their feet on the base's shoulder blades. You can simply hold this position and breathe, or for extra challenge you can raise alternate legs or do push-ups â either in tandem or alternating.

, Since both positions in the duo shell stretch are mutually supportive, both partners generally can take turns being the base and the balancer regardless of any size difference.To start this stretch, the base will enter child's pose. Sitting on your heels, fold your body over from your hips so that the top half of your body presses into your upper thighs and your head is on the mat.
The balancer rests the base of their spine on the base's shoulder blades and positions their feet about hip-width apart with their feet between the base's hands. Then lie back into a full backbend along the base's back, extending your arms out above your head.
Relax and breathe deeply for several breaths, then switch positions with your partner. The calming and supportive nature of this exercise makes it a good one to use as a cool-down to end your partner Pilates practice.

Decide what kind of event planner you'd like to become.,
Go to trade shows and conferences.,
Understand an event planner's duties.,
Assess your own abilities.,
Get relevant hands-on experience.,
Pursue formal training.,
Build a portfolio.,
Complete a certification program with a reputable event planning association.,
Become a member of a relevant trade organization.,
Start working as a certified event planner.",How to Become a Certified Event Planner," Think about whether you want to be known as a generalist event planner (you're willing to help people plan any kind of event), or whether you'd rather specialize in certain types of events, such as wedding receptions, high class corporate events, sports events, and so on. The latter choice allows you to develop a specific expertise in one field, whereas the generalist approach will enable you to select across a broader range of events.


There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches that you should consider - for example, generalist work means that you will have a wide range of events available to possible booking of your services but you won't necessarily be able to distinguish yourself as being unique; whereas, specialist work would enable you to become renowned for certain types of events.
The types of events include weddings, fashion shows, corporate sponsorship events, diplomatic events, celebrity parties, conferences, fundraisers, openings and Open Days, sports events (for example racing cars and horses, football, tennis, etc.), business and product launches, travel accommodation, birthdays, anniversaries and celebrations of people and companies, commemorations, government sponsored events, etc. It is also expected that you will be able to organize any type of meeting.
Determine whether you're willing to travel across the country or you move to a different city. Certain types of event planning are more prevalent in certain places. For example, if you live in a big sports town, you may want to become a sports event planner.;
, These are industry gatherings run by national and international organizations featuring information on even planning as a career. Trade shows and conferences are excellent places to talk to professionals on the pros and cons of the industry. This is a great way to figure out what type of event planning will be a good fit for you., Make sure you know exactly whatâs involved in this highly specialized line of work before you invest in education and training. Duties include locating sites for events, working with caterers, entertainers and decorators, creating lists of attendees, designing invitations, supervising mailings, managing technology, and making special accommodations for guests when necessary.


You'll be expected to do all the research and footwork for your clients. The ability to use technology and networking for this purpose is essential; while you can question your client for some of the information, often the client won't know and doesn't have the time to fill you in on what's essentially your duty anyway.
You'll be expected to design and theme events from start to finish. Some clients will be more hands-on in this area than others but the design aspect still falls squarely inside your obligations. Keep a compilation of ideas from the start of your event planning career so that you always have solutions to suggest and draw on.
Part of the process of planning events is developing your proposal for the event, even before you win the contract. Be aware that this is time-consuming (requiring thought, content creation, photographs, design ideas, etc.) and you may not even win the job. It's advisable to develop a fee for this work or you might have your ideas ""borrowed"" with nothing recouped.
There will always be more things to take care of than any list can ever describe fully. Be ready for anything and everything to be thrown at you, and be ready to have to constantly liaise with people, even if you think you've already sorted things!

, It is very important to be honest when assessing your own abilities because this is a strenuous and demanding role. You will need to be happy to interact and network with people constantly, even at odd hours. Ask yourself the following questions to help determine your suitability for the role:


Are you creative, well organized and very detail-oriented? Being organized is even more important than being creative because you are responsible for the smooth running of everything, while you can always call on other people for the creative input.
Are you able to think laterally and outside of the box?
Do you like to work as part of a team? Are you also patient and able to clearly convey what is expected of everyone within the team?
Do you have the physical stamina to work long hours on your feet in a fast-paced setting? This isn't a 9 to 5 job, so you'll need to work during times that other people would consider ""down time"" such as on weekends.
Can you handle pressure, especially the pressure of last minute changes and quick fixes when things go wrong?
Are you comfortable working with technology (for example, audio set-ups, PowerPoint and computer usage, etc.)? If not, how do you intend to brush up this skill?
Do you have good business acumen, including the ability to negotiate, persuade, and receive and give feedback?
Most importantly, are you good working with people from all walks of life? Excellent people skills are vital in this profession.

, This helps you improve your people skills, a crucial part of an event plannerâs job. It will also be the best way to make a decision as to whether or not this is work you'll love doing. It's wise to try work in event planning for at least a few months before considering formal training, even if you just seek work experience.


Work as an assistant at a hotel or for a caterer, or seek job shadowing opportunities with a professional planner. Get to know what itâs like to work behind the scenes at events that you someday hope to plan.
Volunteer to plan fundraising events with community groups.

, Although training isn't necessary to become an event planner, it's mandatory if you want to get a certificate. It's also a good idea because it will ensure that you have good knowledge to begin with and can show your clients certificates, feedback, references, and so on. There are several ways to get formal training, from getting a degree to apprenticing. What you do will depend on the funds you have available and the availability of training options in your area. The following possibilities are open to you:


Apprenticing with a professional event planner. Apprentice in a support staff role with a professional event planner and work your way up the companyâs ladder.
Completing formal education through a college, vocational school or online program. Study hospitality management, public relations or hotel administration at a trade school, college or university. Attend information sessions to find out more about a course that interests you.
Pursuing online study. Complete a special program designed only for event planners. Find these programs at such websites as Meeting Professionals International. (Follow the education links to view a list of college and university programs that can help you become certified.) There are also various webinars online that enable you to study online.

, Include relevant experience that you can show to prospective employers and to professional associations that offer certification. Keep records of any events you helped to plan, such as photographs and professional references from clients and vendors attesting to your reliability and expertise.

, Contact the various trade organizations associated with the event planning industry, such as Meeting Professionals International (MPI), the International Special Events Society (ISES), the Convention Industry Council (CIC), or the Society of Government Meeting Professionals for assistance. Each organization will have different requirements for certification, but most will require that you have a certain number of years of experience, have completed a training program, and have passed certification exams.


Note the difference between ""certification"" and ""certificate"". While it is possible to get a certificate in event planning from training, it is not possible to get certification from a school. The difference is this: a certificate is the paper you're given by a school at the completion of a program relevant to the field of event planning. A certification, on the other hand, is a professional designation given by a trade organization and it will only be obtained after you have a proven track record of professional experience and have successfully passed the organization's tests.Each program varies in the level of professional experience required, so you'll need to contact the organizations individually to find out if you meet the requirements; if not, keep working until you meet the requirements, as the certification will definitely improve your reputation within the industry.
The most recognized certifications are those offered by the Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) offered by ISES; the Certified Meeting Professional (CIC), and the Certified Meeting Planner (MPI).If you are aiming to be very specific in the type of event planning that you're doing, get certified by specific trade organizations, such as the Association of Bridal Consultants and Weddings Beautiful Worldwide if you're planning to be solely a wedding planner. The specific organizations are likely to be of more assistance when you are tailoring your event planning services narrowly.

, The benefit of belonging to trade organizations is the fact that you'll meet many contacts and find job opportunities through networking and resources only available to members. If you are or have been a student in a recognized event planning course, ask about possible membership discounts, as memberships can be pricey when you're first starting out.

, It is important to make a decision as to whether you're prepared to start your own business or consultancy or whether you'd like to start out by working for someone else. In the latter case, you'll get the benefit of someone else's experience and booked clients but you won't get paid as much and it'll take longer for you to establish your own name. On the other hand, starting from scratch can be hard work and requires funds, business expertise, and a lot of determination; if this is your preferred option, read about starting small businesses and the types of strategies to use, as well as the pitfalls to avoid.


Be aware that some markets are already saturated with event planners. Do your research well in advance of setting up your own business or consultancy.
Don't lose sight of the fact that you can still offer something that is better and more unique than the existing crowd even in a saturated market but what you're offering will need to be extraordinary, and you'll need to be very determined and consistent.

Get a hospitality degree.,
Find a mentor.,
Practice your skills.,
Get feedback.",How to Become an Event Planner1," A bachelor's degree in hospitality can set you firmly on the path for a career as an event planner. In fact, some hospitality degree programs offer concentrations in event planning, so research each school's offerings closely.


Other degrees, such as communications or public relations, can be a good basis for a career in event planning. One of the strongest skills an event planner must have is communication, so this kind of background can be a wonderful foundation.
While a bachelor's degree typically takes four years to complete, there are also shorter, two-year associates degree programs in hospitality, travel and tourism and event planning that can be a good starting point in your training.
Even if you don't have a degree that's directly related, you can complete an event planning and management certificate program to transition into this field. Some of these programs allow students to specialize and focus on areas such as wedding, sports or entertainment planning.
The kinds of classes you can expect to take as part of your training may include special events marketing, facilities operations, media relations, cost control strategies, event coordination, risk management, economics and professional ethics.;
, A mentor is someone who can teach, encourage and guide you in your career. Mentorship often develops from a relationship you already have in place or establish with someone you admire.


Think about what you want in a mentor. Do you need someone to model professional behavior? Do your financial management skills need work? Are you looking to become a more effective communicator? Approach people you already know who can share their knowledge with you. It may not necessarily be someone in your field; what's important is that you get what you need from the relationship.
You may gravitate toward someone as a mentor because he or she is successful, which also means they're busy. Before you ask someone to spend time helping you, think about how you can help them. Offer to pitch in on a project, organize their calendar, run errands--give something of value so that you can get something of value in return.
Consider peer-to-peer mentoring. You can find support and encouragement from others who have goals similar to yours. Start a Meetup group or create a club on campus where you can join with like-minded people to share information, accountability and successes.
Broaden your search. Alumni groups, networking events and professional organization meetings are all good places to get to know potential mentors.

, Chances are your interest in this field stems from skills you already have when it comes to putting together parties and organizing events. Step up now and volunteer to plan birthday parties, housewarmings, weddings and other get-togethers for family and friends.


Tons of volunteer organizations have annual events--runs, walks, fundraising dinners--that need to be planned. Reach out to volunteer agencies in your community to find out their needs and offer to take a leading role in putting together their event.
Document your practice. Take photos of place settings and decorations to put in your portfolio for later. Make copies of budgets and timelines, menus and invoices. Hold on to everything that shows the work that went into making the event a success.

, After an event, ask participants for their feedback by having them complete a short (key: short) survey.


Make your survey part of your initial agreement. Consider your clients' feedback as compensation for your hard work and have them agree to answer a few questions at the conclusion of the event. Their comments--positive and negative--can be a valuable part of your learning process.
Eavesdrop. Listen to what people at the event are saying to one another in conversation. Make note of what people seem to enjoy (""This food is delicious."" ""The flowers are stunning."") as well as areas of disappointment (""Why isn't there a place for coats?"" ""We had to park so far away!"")

Put together a portfolio.,
Start networking.,
Tap into the internet.,
Pound the pavement.,
Consider working freelance or opening your own business.,
Keep trying.",How to Become an Event Planner2," Having concrete examples of your work to show prospective employers lends you credibility and supports the impression that you are someone with knowledge and experience.


Keep records of any events you helped to plan. Hold on to photographs, sample invitations and professional references from clients and vendors attesting to your reliability and expertise. Put these in a professional-looking binder or case. If possible, scan them and have them available to send to prospective employers via email.
Prepare a professional resume on which you include your experience and education. Be sure to list volunteer assignments and professional and student organizations you are a part of.
Write an individualized cover letter for each job opening. There is no such thing as a ""one-size-fits-all"" cover letter. Customize you letter in a way that addresses the specific needs of the organization and how you can meet them.

, Tell everyone you know that you're looking for work and ask them to pass on any leads. You never know who someone else might know or what they might hear about a job opening.


Create a LinkedIn account. This social media site allows you to set up an account where you can post your resume, join industry groups and network with others in your field.
Keep track of classmates. If someone who was in your program lands a job, ask them how they did it and if there are more openings available at their new place of employment.
Have business cards made and keep them with you at all times. Business cards are relatively inexpensive and good to have on hand because you never know where or when you might run in to someone who can help you find a job.

, So much job hunting is done online these days, that it's essential that you visit popular job sites. Also, certain professional organizations or specialty sites list jobs postings in the event management field, which allows you to use to focus your job-hunting efforts.


Monster.com, HotJobs.com and CareerBuilder.com are popular pages to check for jobs; narrow your search by using key terms such as ""event planner,"" ""event management,"" ""wedding planner,"" ""event coordinator,"" or ""hospitality.""
The Meeting Professionals International website has an online Career Center where you can search for jobs (careers.mpiweb.org). Also check out specialeventsite.com and careers.nace.net (the job site for the National Association of Catering Executives).

, Research the event planning companies in your area and stop by to drop off your resume. Sometimes a personal approach--especially in this very people-oriented field--can make a difference.


Look your best and be professional when you visit. Be sure you know the name of the person in charge so that you can ask for a quick meeting with him or her. If a meeting isn't possible at that time, politely leave your resume and cover letter with the receptionist and plan to followup with a phone call in a few days.
Carry your portfolio with you in case you are successful in getting in to meet with someone who could hire you.

, These may be steps you want to take after spending a few years working in the field, or you may be someone who already knows he or she would prefer to work for themselves.


Research the competition. See what event planning companies already exist in your area and what they specialize in. If you're able to distinguish yourself from the pack in some way, it can be an advantage in getting established and getting clients.
Talk to other freelancers or business owners. There's no need to learn everything the hard way. Tap into the experience of others who can help you avoid some of the pitfalls that can come with working on your own.

, Finding a job in any field is difficult work. Persistence does pay off, so stay positive and keep at it.


Form a support group with friends who are also job hunting. Surrounding yourself with people who are in the same boat as you can lessen your feelings of isolation and disappointment during this process.
Celebrate small victories. An interview, a query, a callback--these are all positive things. Even if they don't lead to a job at the moment, they let you know you're on the right path and there's interest out there in who you are and what you have to offer.

"
Apply for certification with reputable event planning associations.,
Consider membership in a relevant trade organization as well; the benefit of belonging to trade organizations is that you'll meet many contacts and find job opportunities through networking and resources only available to members.",How to Become an Event Planner3," You do not have to become certified to work as an event planner. But having that designation could open doors for you and certainly puts you in touch with other professionals who value high standards in the field.


A certification is a professional designation given by a trade organization and can only be obtained after you have a proven track record of professional experience and have successfully passed the organization's tests.The most recognized certifications are those offered by the Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) offered by ISES; the Certified Meeting Professional (CIC), and the Certified Meeting Planner (MPI).Each program varies in the level of professional experience required, so you'll need to contact the organizations individually to find out if you meet the requirements.

,


If you plan to specialize, look for specific trade organizations that focus on your area of expertise. For example, a wedding planner may want to check out a group such as the Association of Bridal Consultants and Weddings Beautiful Worldwide.
If you are or have been a student in a recognized event planning course, ask about possible membership discounts, as memberships can be pricey when you're first starting out.

"
"
Decide what you want to be known for.,
Network.,
Keep chasing new ideas.",How to Become an Event Planner4," When you brand yourself, you're choosing how you want to been seen by others in the work world. Your brand incorporates what you do best and who you are.


Brainstorm a list of words that describe you--your persona, your outlook, your expertise. Use these to form the basis of your marketing and advertising programs.
Establish an online presence. People will be searching for the kinds of services you offer, so you want to make sure you're online in a way that's professional and helpful.

Create a Facebook page for your business. Post a professional-looking photo of yourself and post regularly about projects you are working on. Include photos of your events as well. (Be sure to get permission before posting any pictures that feature clients or guests.)
Start a blog. A blog can help you establish yourself as an expert in your field. Post small ""how-to"" articles to help readers, talk about events you've been working on, trends you've noticed and news from your field.
Open a Twitter account. Start discussions, voice your expert opinion, made predictions about what will be hot this season--keep it interesting and upbeat.



, If you want people to know who you are and what you do, you have to put yourself out there. Join professional organizations, attend trade shows and take part in continuing education seminars. These are all great ways to make connections and to spread the word about your services.


Consider forming alliances with others in related fields. Ran into an amazing florist? Met a great photographer? Be sure to let them know what you do and stay in touch--they may have business they can send your way and vice versa.

, Some of the basics of event planning never change--you have to be a great communicator, experienced budget planner and flawless with details. But styles change and trends need to be followed so that you can keep the look of projects current and fresh.


Keep updating. Read trade magazines to find out what's hot and take new classes and workshops to refresh your skills.
Follow fashion. Look at fashion, decorating and food magazines to learn what's in style. See what's popular on Pinterest. Staying up-to-date will help you avoid producing events that feel dated or stale.

Work your way up to a management-level position.,

Have a respectful relationship with the inmates.,
Provide for the needs of the inmates by allocating public funds correctly.,
Handle the death row inmates with grace.,
Deal with the press.,
Influence the policies of the prison.,
Maintain a safe operation at all times.",How to Become a Prison Warden," This is the bare minimum requirement you need for becoming a prison warden. You'll need to earn a high school diploma or a GED to move on to earn a bachelor's degree, which can give you some preparation you need to be a prison warden. Getting a high school diploma will also ensure that you have literacy skills and the basic communication skills that are necessary for the position of prison warden., Though there isn't any one given major that you need to get with your bachelor's degree that would put you straight on the path to be a prison warden, it can help to get a major in a relevant field such as criminology, administration of justice, or social work. However, if you check out the biographies of wardens at the Tennessee Department of Corrections, you'll see that they studied a variety of fields that include English, science, and business.Getting a bachelor's degree in a relevant field will also help you understand the work of a correctional officer, which can include a prison officer, prison jailer, and prison warden. Having a better sense of what this position entails, will help you see if this is a career path you truly want to pursue.

, You'll need to pass a background check to start working at a correctional facility or in a law enforcement role at any level, so make sure there are no felonies or murky territory in your past. Since you'll be working to help inmates become law-abiding citizens, you'll have to be a law-abiding citizen yourself. If you've had a felony, a misdemeanor in the past five years, or even a charge that involved drugs or violence, you will be disqualified from the position in most cases., You'll most likely have to submit to a drug test if you're a finalist in the application process for being a prison warden. It is understood that you should be clean., If you want to be a prison warden, then you need to possess or work to posses the skills that will be most crucial to the success of your career. Here are a few of the most important qualities you'll need to really flourish in the position:Money management skills. One of your main jobs will be to use public funds to house, feed, and clothe prisoners adequately, as well as to provide crucial services such as education and health care to the prisoners. You'll need to know how to manage money to make sure you can strike the best balance.
Critical thinking skills. Your prison will be filled with problems, and it will often take creativity and hard thinking to find a way to solve it.
Interpersonal skills. You'll need to know how to not only interact and communicate with the inmates, but you'll also need to know how to speak to your staff to communicate your needs.
Physical strength. Though you'll be doing much of your work from being a desk, you will also be interacting with prisoners, and you should stay strong in case you find yourself in a dangerous situation.
Writing skills. You will need to have strong writing skills to work with other administrators in the federal system to communicate the needs of your prison effectively.

, That's right. You would graduate with your bachelor's degree and move straight up to role of prison warden. In case it isn't clear, the position of prison warden is a highly-coveted and high-paying position that requires many years of relevant experience. Prison warden is often the end of the career path of a person who has been working in the correctional officer field. However, there is no one set path to getting the experience you need to be a warden. Here are some most common ways to do it:Start working as a correctional officer and work your way into being a lower-level administrator at the prison.
Work in a position of management or administration in another relevant, or somewhat relevant field.
Work in business management or other fields that require strong money management skills.
Work in increasingly challenging roles as a supervisor. This will give you the experience you need to manage staff and inmates.
Work as a police officer or an investigator. This will give you a different perspective into the field of criminal justice.

, This is a bit vague, but what you need to do is gain some experience working with people, and showing that you're brave, determined, and conscious of the needs of others. This can mean training to be a police officer and working in that field for a few years, gaining some experience in the military (if this was already a path you have completed or considered), or even putting in some time to be a social worker.


There is no one key way to get ""hands on"" experience. However, you will need something to point to when you apply to be a prison warden so you can say that you understand human psychology, the needs of the prisoners, and so on.

, You can do this in several ways, but you'll have to work your way up from the bottom. You can begin as a probation officer, correctional officer, or even as a prison guard. Working as a correctional officer will help you understand the dynamics of prison life, and will give you a better sense of the needs of both the staff at the facility as well as the prisoners. When you become a prison warden, you can recall the time you spend working in a more hands-on environment with the prisoners, and this will give you a better sense of what you really need.To enter this field, the Federal Bureau of Prisons will require you to have not only a bachelor's degree, but also 3 years of full-time experience providing counseling, assistance, or supervision to individuals or a combination of the two.
Before you can become a correctional officer, you will need at least 200 hours of training, as well as to meet the qualifications for the position you seek.

, If you want to be a prison warden, then all of your hard work in the field of law enforcement or corrections has to lead you to move up in the ranks. This can mean gaining an administrative position in the prison, working as a supervisor, or doing whatever you can to work your way up to a position where you manage people and gain interpersonal and communication skills.


When you're a prison warden, dozens or even hundreds of people may be under your watch, so you have to prove that you have what it takes to have this level of authority.
The important thing is that you demonstrate your leadership skills.
You can even work in a management-level position in the business field. Though having criminal justice experience in some form is important, so is being business savvy.

, Though this isn't a mandatory step for all future prison wardens, some prison warden positions require you to have a Master's in Criminal Justice before you even apply for the position. This degree can also help you move up in the ranks in your current position in law enforcement or in a relevant field. If you apply to the right program, you may be able to pursue a Master's in Criminal Justice at night or on a flexible schedule so you can continue to thrive in your career at the same time.

, Your best chance of applying for the position of prison warden is to come from the ranks of corrections officers, preferably in the region or location where you would like to become a warden. However, keep in mind that you can also be appointed to be a prison warden. In this case, the emphasis on your qualifications will be on all the administrative skills that you gained.A panel interview may be a part of the hiring process, so be prepared to articulate your qualifications for the position.
Most prisoners have several wardens that report to the chief warden. You may apply to one of these positions first, before working your way up to the position of chief warden.

, Your staff will know the ins and outs of the prison and will need to keep you appraised of every little thing that is going on every day that you come in. To be a capable prison warden, you'll need to develop strong relationships with your staff so they can come to you and tell you what happened the night after or the morning before your last shift.Since the prison is patrolled 24 hours a day, you'll have to meet with several rotations of your staff to know exactly what is going on.
You shouldn't be best friends with the staff, but you should command their respect so they give you the information you need.

, You should not be overly-friendly with the inmates, but you shouldn't be absolutely tyrannical, either. Like the staff, the inmates have to trust you so they can come to you with major concerns that could affect the way you run the prison. Although the inmates will have more contact with the prison guards, they should meet with you regularly to discuss their concerns.You'll also meet with prisoners who had major problems or got involved in altercations. You will need to enforce their punishment while making them see the errors of their ways.

, You'll have to properly allocate the public funds that you are given to run the prison, which will often not feel adequate enough to cover everything they need. You'll have to prioritize and make decisions about what the inmates really need, and what they can do without; for example, you might have to make a choice between raising the quality of the food and giving the prisoners more educational options. Here are some things you will have to oversee:The quality of the inmate's food and clothing
Mental stimulation for the inmates, from extra-curricular activities to upkeeping the prison library
Health care for the prisoners
Physical stimulation for the inmates, such as the maintenance of an outdoor track or exercise equipment

, If you're governing a jail with a death row area, then you will play a key role in carrying out the rules of the sentence, such as the visit from the Chaplin, the last meal, and the orchestration of the lethal injection or whatever method of death is used by your prison.


These duties will be difficult, especially if you have known the inmate for a while, but you will have to stay calm and mature as you carry out these difficult tasks.

, If your prison is suffering from an issue the press has noticed, then you will often be the person who is chosen to speak on behalf of the prison. You will have to answer the questions of the press with care, and make sure the prison looks professional and respectable at all times. Don't lose your cool or offer up information that you may regret saying later.


You will be acting as a representative of your institution, so you will have to conduct yourself as respectably as possible.

, You will also work with corrections supervisors to help them adopt various policies and procedures that can help the prison run more smoothly. This is when you will wear your administrative hat. The rules you will put into action will include intake and classification, education and job training, recreational programs as well as the disciplinary measures that are taken.


You will have to be knowledgeable not only in what makes a prison run in general, but about which policies are best for your prison and your population of inmates.

, At the end of the day, one of your most important concerns is to keep the prisoners safe in the prison as well as to keep the public safe from the prisoners. You will have to enforce the rules and regulations of the prison, including laws about incarceration and employee contact, and to keep a well-ordered record of the infractions of the inmates as well as the staff.


One of your jobs will be to make sure the staff is not taking advantage of the prisoners.
You will also be in charge of the response during a crisis, such as a riot, a major fight, a suicide, or a natural disaster.

Sign the contract.",How to Draft a Coaching Contract," Before sitting down to draft your own contract, you should look for sample contracts online. There is no standard âone size fits allâ coaching contract. Instead, contracts differ depending on your school and whether the coach is getting paid.


For example, contracts for college coaches are very extensive. The compensation is usually complicated, and college coaches have a long list of duties.If you are drafting a contract for a college coach, you should see a lawyer before beginning.
By contrast, a volunteer coaching contract could be much shorterâabout a page in length.You should try to find contracts which can serve as a guide as you draft your own. If you are a high school, then ask other high schools in your area if you can see a copy of their contract to use as a guide.;
, To begin drafting the coaching contract, you should open a blank word processing document. Set the font to a readable size and style. Many people are comfortable reading Times New Roman 12 point.


If you have letterhead, then you can print the first page of the contract on letterhead. Be sure to space down enough so that the contract wonât print over the letterhead.

, You should title the contract âEmployment Agreement for Head Football Coachâ or something equivalent. You should make the title bold and in all caps.You also might want to make the title slightly larger in size (such as 14 point) so that it stands out.
Center the title between the left- and right-hand margins.

, Begin the contract by identifying the school and the coach. You can also include the date the contract becomes effective.


Sample language might read, âThis employment agreement (âAgreementâ) is made and entered into effective as of the 30th day of June, 2016, by and between the and Michael âMikeâ Smith (âCoachâ).â, Your contract might use terms which could have more than one meaning or which are vague. After identifying the parties, you can include a list of defined terms.Terms which you might need to define include:


Any acronyms. For example, if you belong to a sports league, then you should define the leagueâs acronym.
âService periodâ or âacademic year.â Make sure that you define these terms. An academic year, for example, might stretch from July 1 to June 30.
Terms like âspouse.â If you are including information about fringe benefits in your contract, then you should define whether âspouseâ includes same-sex partners.

, You should explain how long the contract lasts for. You could have the contract last for only one season or for multiple seasons. In some states, teachers at public institutions cannot have contracts lasting more than one year. The most common duration terms in coaching contracts are the following:A specified number of years. For example, you could have the contract last three years.
A specific number of years but with a ârolloverâ provision. For example, a contract might be a three-year contract with a rollover provision for renewal of up to an additional year.
A specified number of years with an agreement to renegotiate at a certain point in time. For example, you could have the contract last three years but with a chance to renegotiate after two years.

, You should use bullet points to explain the coachâs duties. You should be as comprehensive as possible. For example, a coachâs duties might include the following:instruction of athletes
supervision of team practices and conditioning sessions
supervision and instruction of athletes in competitive events
commitment to the academic success of student athletes
selection and evaluation of all assistants, including volunteers, interns, student coaches, graduate assistants, etc.
recruitment of athletes
budgeting for the team
involvement in fundraising
scheduling competitive events
media relations
adherence to the rules and policies of the school and the governing athletic association

, You need to include a provision on compensation. If you are a high school, then your coach may only be paid a one-time stipend. If you are a college or university, then the compensation package could be quite extensive:


Base salary. You should explain the amount of money and the schedule for payments. For example, you may pay monthly on the last day of each month. Explain if payment is spread out for the entire 12 months of the year or if the salary is paid out during the months of the sports season.
Benefits, such as medical, dental, disability, and life insurance.
Allowances for expenses, such as clothing, cell phones, or fuel for travel.
Bonuses. You could offer the coach a fixed-sum bonus for any championships won. In addition, you could offer a percentage of ticket revenues or bonuses for student graduation rates., You should also include a termination provision. A well-written contract will explain what conditions can trigger termination âfor cause.â For example, you might want to include any of the following:The coach knowingly violates school or governing athletic association rules, or the coach knows that others in his or her administration have violated the rules but fails to report the violations.
The coach fails to carry out the duties specified in the contract and fails to correct any failure.
The coach is convicted of a felony.
The coach commits misconduct that harms the reputation of the university.
The coach commits fraud, e.g., by falsifying records or condoning employees who do.
The coach becomes disabled or dies.
The coach gambles on sports.
The coach uses substances, such as prescription drugs or alcohol, which impair the coachâs ability to perform his or her job.
The coach commits acts of violence, whether or not they result in public prosecution.

, Make sure that the contract explains what will happen if the coach or the school terminates the contract before its expiration date. If the school terminates the contract for any reason other than âfor cause,â then it usually needs to pay the coach money.


Include a provision stating that the coach must resign in writing and that he or she has no entitlement to compensation or benefits after the termination date.
Also have the coach agree to pay the school a lump-sum to cover the cost of recruiting a new coach.
If the school cancels the contract, then it usually agrees to pay the coach a large fixed-sum of money and to continue benefits through the end of the contract term. In exchange, the coach agrees to sign a release, agreeing not to sue the school.
There should also be a provision that the school will not have to pay money or benefits if the coach finds another job., You can also include a provision in the contract where the coach agrees not to take another coaching job at a competing school for a certain amount of time after leaving your school. This is called a ânon-competeâ provision.The non-compete clause needs to be âreasonable.â Your state law will define what is reasonable, but generally you cannot prohibit the coach from working somewhere else for too long.
For example, non-compete agreements of one or two years are typically acceptable. Anything longer will probably be unreasonable.
Also, the geographic scope of the non-compete clause must also be reasonable. If you are a high school, you cannot prohibit a coach from working anywhere in the country. Instead, the geographic scope must be more limited. For example, you could prohibit the coach from working on a team in your same conference.

, Every contract contains certain provisions, regardless of the content of the contract. These provisions are called âboilerplate,â and you should have them in your coaching contract as well. You will want the following provisions:


Choice of law provision. If there is a lawsuit, the judge will need to interpret the contract according to the law of a state. You can determine the state. Typically, schools choose the state where they are located. For example: âThis Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.â
Severability clause. You should state that the contract will remain in effect even if a judge finds one provision illegal: âIf any term, clause, or provision shall be deemed illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such a determination shall not affect the legality of any other term, clause, or provision; and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such term, clause, or provision had not been included.â
Merger clause. You also want to state that the contract contains the entire agreement: âThis Agreement incorporates any and all prior oral agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to its subject matter.â, At the bottom of contract you should create signature blocks for both the coach and the representative who will sign for the school.Typically, you will have a principal or athletic director sign for the school.

, Once you have drafted your contract, you should have an attorney review it. Your school probably already has a lawyer âon retainer.â This means that your school pays the lawyer a fee each month. In exchange, the lawyer is available to help you whenever you call.Ask your principal or school board who your lawyer is. You can then schedule an appointment and show the lawyer your contract. He or she can make suggestions for revision.
If your school does not have a lawyer, then you should find your local or state bar association. This is an organization formed by lawyers. Most bar associations run referral programs.

, You should invite the coach to your office to sign the contract. You should have given the coach a copy of the contract ahead of time, so that he or she could review it and make suggestions for revision.

Once the contract has been signed, distribute copies. Make copies of the signed coaching contract and give the coach a copy.
Store the original in a safe place.

Donât trash talk.,
Control your temper.,
Respect the other teamâs effort.,
Be gracious in victory and defeat.",How to Show Good Sportsmanship1," When your competitive juices start flowing, it may be tempting to call members of the other team names or make fun of them. But you canât win a game by running your mouth, and it only makes you look desperate. Focus on outperforming your opponent on the field or court, not on landing a good insult., In the heat of a game, it can be easy to lose your cool, particularly if youâve just gotten elbowed or the other team keeps scoring on you. Donât let your anger affect your behavior, though. Sports are supposed to be fun, so donât lose sight of the big picture just because things are going your way.Retaliating against another player if theyâve hit, pushed, elbowed, or otherwise tried to injury you is never a good idea. Youâll only wind up penalizing your own team.
Avoid any violent confrontations with other players. If someone threatens you or youâre worried a situation is going to escalate, talk to the officials or a coach.

, Whether theyâre outplaying you or unable to keep up with your team, itâs important to recognize that theyâve put in plenty of hard work to prepare for the game, just like your team has. Having respect for the other team is crucial to good sportsmanship.You may actually be able to learn something from your opponent, so keep an open mind. If theyâre playing better than you are, you may be able to pick up some pointers for the next game.

, When you win a big game, itâs easy to get carried away in your celebration. However, if youâre a good sport, you donât gloat over a victory or try to make your opponents feel bad about their performance. Conversely, if you lose, you shouldnât pout or downplay the other teamâs victory.Whether you win or lose, get in the habit of congratulating the other team. It shows that you value the game itself and the effort that goes into it just as much as an actual victory.

Figure out the budget.,
Build on the community A sports team is comprised of a group of people that form a community around the common interest of sport.,
Do something special.,
Broadcast your accomplishments!,
Ask for feedback.",How to Manage a Youth Sports Team," Make sure you get every participantâs key information like their preferred contact method (email, cellphone, etc.). Set up an email list using services like http://www.qlubb.com so that everyone can send an email to the group email address rather than having to list everybodyâs email address. Publish the roster on the web so that people can get to know each other, set up carpools, etc.;
, Set up the call tree so that you can get in touch with people when it counts. Peopleâs preferred method of communication should be taken into account. Last minute rain outs of games and other cancellations require a quick and reliable response so that nobody gets stuck. Maintain this roster online so that everyone has the most up-to-date contact information.

, Have that first team meeting where everyone can get acquainted but most importantly get agreement on the goals. Determine if your team is out to win the championship or to learn and have fun. Prior to any meeting you should do some informal polling and discussion so that you can go to the team meeting prepared.

, Donât get stuck doing everything. People are really willing to help if asked. At every meeting look for a chance to recruit volunteers, especially based on any skills they might have. Online sign up sheets are very useful so that everybody knows whatâs been taken and whatâs left to do and they can sign up on their own time.

, Get a master schedule online published as soon as possible. It should include all practices, games and tournaments. Putting it online cuts down on needless email chatter and eliminates miscommunication. Services like http://www.qlubb.com has the ability to publish schedules either privately within the group or publicly.

, Most budgets for recreational sports teams are simple and straightforward. However, expenses and collections of money must balance at the end of the season. Make sure you account for all costs like league fees, equipment costs, tournament fees, transportation and housing costs. Remember that having a fundraiser costs money. Look at ways to defray costs through activity fees, bake sales/car washes, sponsorships from local sports stores, subsidies from sports equipment manufacturers, etc.

, However, over time as people get to know each other, bonds strengthen. Fostering the community through things like photo sharing, team picnics, after game dinners are a great way to have fun while also improving trust and teamwork.

, Getting your team excited about the sport can help enrich the experience. If the professionals are having a tournament in town, arrange for a field trip. If you are budget conscious, you can see some great competition at the college level. Most sports have a hall of fame that you could arrange to visit. If you ask around, you might be able to find a pro in the area who might donate some time to run a guest practice session.

, Put up a public web page and talk about your wins! Nothing makes a team more proud than to let people know what you accomplished. It also lets players send that link to grandma. Sites like Qlubb have the ability to automatically generate a public site based on the content of the site which minimizes the overhead.

, Keep an open dialog with everyone and be flexible. Itâs important to listen. Sports team can live for months to years and requirements change all the time. A good leader will be able to anticipate what's needed by constantly listening.

You shouldnât care about your own performance more than the team.Itâs often little things that show youâre a team player, such as always arriving at practice on time or helping to clean up afterward.

You should learn not only what it takes to be successful in that particular sport, but what youâre allowed to do and what youâll be penalized for.You can find the rules and guidelines for most sports by doing a basic online search.

Coaching is not a normal everyday job where you get to clock out and go home. It requires a large time of commitment. If you do not have this passion to become a basketball coach it will be very hard to be successful.;
, Reaching out to coaches at all levels can be very helpful. This is a profession where the majority of jobs come from who you know and not what you know. Reaching out to coaches and introducing yourself at clinics and camps can be instrumental for your future success.


Working summer camps can help you network and gain valuable experience as an aspiring coach. Networking isn't limited to just basketball coaches, networking with referees and athletic administration can be useful in helping your career.

, Treat everyday as another day to become a better coach no matter what the setting is. Dedicate some time of your day to read another coach's blog, or to watch a quick instructional video. Attend other games and practices and observe how their coach coaches his or her team. Many coaches at all levels of college basketball are willing to help you if you reach out to them.

, Just like anything else in life, most good things take time. Very few coaches get their dream job at a young age, it takes time to develop as a coach. You must put the time to be successful in coaching, which may require missing vacations and trips that other people your age get to enjoy. There are a lot more profitable summer jobs than coaching basketball, but if you are serious about coaching as a profession then you must work on it.

, An underrated concept that many young coaches overlook is how to find a niche in their particular coaching staff. The first part is to identify a weakness on the staff. For example, it may be technology or strength training. If you are not strong in that particular area, become strong in it, learn about it, and get help from people that are strong in that field.


Another way to find a niche if you are having trouble is to do the âdirty work.â Do things that others donât want to do and take pride in it because you will eventually entrusted with more responsibility.

, Be ready and willing to do different things because people will take notice of that and give you more respect and responsibility if you do a good job. Take a job outside your comfort zone. Coach at a camp and use it as a learning experience, and you may find that you like that better than you thought.

, If you have passion and desire to become a basketball coach, then you need to be willing to move out of your comfort zone and go different places to further your career.

, Many young coaches at all levels of college basketball make little to no money. Itâs a part of the territory that you must treat your responsibility as a coach like a job if itâs what you want to do as a profession in the future. Many young coaches donât dress likes coaches. If you want people to take you as a professional you must dress like one and carry yourself as one.

, Developing relationships with players and coaches is another key part to being successful. Many coaches at first will be skeptical to add a young member to their staff due to various reasons. Developing a relationship with someone that is already in the coaching profession who will vouch for your abilities and work ethic is major help in getting your foot in the door. Donât just use a coach for a reference, but help them out when possible and keep in contact with your network. Do not only contact them when you need something.

, Take bits and pieces from every coach and then develop your own basketball philosophy. Donât try to emulate just one coach but try to learn something from everyone and let that help you develop your own coaching philosophy. Donât be afraid to have your own personal philosophy evolve over time or differ from others, it does not mean it is wrong.

, Having a plan is important to continue moving up the coaching ladder. Reach out to other people that have become coaches to get advice on how to develop your own personal plan to achieve your goals. Have an attainable goal that you are striving for with a certain time frame.

Never talk back or disrespect your coach.,
Obey your coach.,
Develop good skills.,
Think before you act.,
Bring the problem up in an email or phone call.,
Try hard to practice the skills the coach is teaching, so that the coach can't say you're slacking.

,
Always follow directions and listen intently when the coach is talking.,
Work your hardest and best.,
If the problem is serious, talk to your parents, and they can have a meeting with the coach and the principal.",How to Deal with a Mean Coach," That will give him or her a reason to be mean to you.;
, Do whatever they ask. Running a few extra laps or staying after to help pick up the equipment is a small price to pay for a happy coach.

, Be early, or right on time to each practice and game. Offer to help with equipment. Greet your coach when you arrive. It may seem a little awkward at first, but you'll both soon grow used to it. It will improve the coach's mood as well.

, This means that if your coach is mean to you for no reason, someone else can back you up as you tell your coach that what he or she is doing is wrong.

, Be as polite as possible.

,, This shows the coach that you are serious and eager to learn.

, When the coach sees you, he/she won't have a reason to be angry at you. In fact, he/she might even be proud of you.

, Understand that it isn't okay for your coach to belittle you, humiliate you, call you names, or get in your face and yell at you to try to intimidate you. People like that have no business coaching kids, and you need to tell your parents or teachers about this right away!

Stop deceiving yourself.,
Separate praise and blame from failure and success.,
Use criticism as a means for improving.,
Praise for the sake of recognition, not as a means of deflecting criticism.,
Role model dealing with criticism.",How to Cope With Criticism As a Leader," When somebody criticizes your leadership, it is all too easy to respond by trying to justify your actions and actively try to turn the criticism into praise. If you focus on the feeling of being misunderstood or misjudged, you will place yourself right into the position of defensiveness instead of listening openly. You will be tempted to highlight your achievements, point out how successful your projects are, and how people have rewarded your leadership prowess. At the same time, you might even be tempted to make comparisons with others and point out their failings in comparison with your achievements. Unfortunately, all of these reactions are defensive rather than expansive and mindful.;
, Praise for work well done and recognition for achievements are accolades that we all seek and these have their place. Equally, we learn early on the potential benefits of accepting accountability when things go wrong sometimes. But criticism and praise are not indicators of the failure or success of you or your projects; think about how a successful developer will often be criticized by local residents who feel they have lost their amenities despite the project's success, or about all of Thomas Edison's failures receiving praise, despite their failings. Neither example illuminates us as to the real outcome and they both demonstrate that the reality is always much more complex. For you, it means understanding that criticism isn't going to undermine your overall success.

, Criticism is leveled at leaders for various reasons, with the main one being that people perceive something isn't working to their benefit or for the greater good of something everyone has a stake in. When people feel powerless to initiate change and innovation themselves, the leader is the sensible target for expressing their discontent. First, work out why those you're in charge of might be feeling this way and try to remedy it so that they feel they have a greater ability to innovate, participate in developing solutions, and initiate changes. Second, reflect over the criticism. Often there is the germ of accuracy in even the most negative criticism and if you can pull out something positive from this, it serves not only you but your business, staff, team, community group, project, whatever it is you're leading, will benefit as well. Third, don't take to heart the obviously nasty criticism. There will always be people who lop tall poppies because they feel jealousy or personal frustration at not taking action. Take such nasty critiques in your stride and let it be; simply ignore that type of criticism and get on with what you're doing right. It helps to remember that leaders are the people who act on their ideas whereas many people who criticize with bitterness have had ideas but lacked the will to act.

, Always note the good that those working under you do, and always make a point of giving them due credit for their efforts. Don't praise only when you fear criticism, or you will always be on the back foot. Moreover, you don't want people conforming to your way of thinking in order to get your praise; it is very important to praise a job well done even where you disagree with its method, motives, or outcome, provided it enhances the relevant experience and improves the overall prospects of the business/project/activity, etc.

, Let others see good reactions from you when criticized. Your ability to listen and learn, and your ability to acknowledge where you have made mistakes teaches others that it's OK to err and that it's acceptable to change your tactics to ones that are likely to be more effective. That's a lesson that only a leader can effectively teach, from moms to boardroom directors!

Surf the internet to discover new opportunities.
Accept any coaching jobs. Don't expect to jump right into the head coaching position. Of course, it makes sense to hope for that job, but accept an assistant coaching position too.
Start small. People running the clubs or teams need to see what you can do as a coach. There has to be some trust that you know what you are doing, and that the players will be safe.

, The instructor must be able to take a ""child-centered"" approach vs. a task oriented approach. If learning as an adult, seek an instructor who will treat you as an adult.

, Positive reinforcement will give the student confidence to improve and make corrections.

, If your child is under the age of 3, the instructor uses a pool with a minimum water temperature of 87 degrees. If the child is between 3 & 5, the water temperature should be at least 85 degrees, and if the child is between 6 & 12, the water should be at least 83 degrees for swimming instruction. Competitive swimmers (usually age 6 and over) can practice in water as cool as 78 degrees (although 80 - 82 is ideal) because they are working harder, getting their heart rate up, and will actually even sweat in the water from the intensity of the workout.

, The instructor should use Lesson Plans.

, The instructor should promise a particular teacher; student ratio. Here are some excellent guidelines:


6 - 36 months: Parent & Me format, up to 6:1 ratio is okay since parent is in the water.
3 - 4 year olds: No more than a 4:1 ratio if a buoyancy device is being used. Without a buoyancy device, no more than a 2:1 ratio.
5 - 6 year olds: Up to 6:1 ratio if a buoyancy device is being used. No more than 4:1 ration if no buoyancy device.
7 - 12 year olds: Up to 8:1 ratio if the children can stand and/or have a buoyancy device.
Adults: Up to 4:1 ratio, adult students to teacher.

, The instructor should allow you to watch every second of the class! If the instructor says you can't watch, you need to find another program. Never leave your child alone with anyone. Also, you are an extra set of eyes making sure your child is safe in the water. Constant supervision is one critical aspect of drowning prevention.

, In general, you would want a teacher who is at least 18 years of age (there are exceptions).

,, If the instructor has a ""no refunds"" policy, you better do some extensive observation of the instructor before hiring him/her. Find out what they will do if you miss class due to illness. If a make-up isn't offered, a credit for a future class is a good option.

, No chlorine is your biggest concern, and low PH will actually cause the eyes to get sore. Tip: You can buy a test kit at stores supplying pool equipment (box stores, sports stores, hardware stores, etc.) and test the water yourself.

Add a scarf.,
Try a wrap.,
Use cold-weather gear.,
Drape on a long cardigan.,
Keep your feet warm.,
Upgrade your fabrics.",How to Stay Warm at Work1," A scarf around your neck is a good way to gain some warmth. It helps add heat to your body, namely your neck and back. Plus, you can choose a high-end scarf to still look professional. Try keeping one in your desk to take out as needed., Another option for the office is a wrap that you can use around the top half of your body. If you pick one in a nice material (such as silk or cashmere), it will still look professional as it keeps you warm.If you pick a wrap made from a thin, warm material, you can easily keep it neatly folded in your desk.

, Athletic cold-weather gear is made to fit close to the skin. In fact, most of the time, it will work under work clothes. Add a layer or two underneath your regular clothes to stay warm at work.For instance, you could wear thin jogger's leggings made from polypropylene or capilene under your work pants or a long-sleeved shirt made from the same material under a dress shirt.You can also try long underwear in silk., A cardigan can help keep you warm, but it only helps your top half. However, if you choose a long cardigan, you'll keep more of yourself warm. In fact, you can keep a long cardigan at work specifically for this purpose., You may need to switch to more sensible shoes to help keep your feet warm. When you do, you can add a pair of wool socks, which will keep your feet nice and toasty in the cold office., Cotton or polyester are common fabrics for professional clothes and sweaters. However, if you want more warmth out of your fabrics, choose wool or cashmere, which will insulate you more efficiently."

Determine which coaching style works best for you and benefits the players the most.,
Know the game.,
Know the difference in skill levels.,
Eliminate favoritism.,
Be a role model for players.",How to Coach Girls Softball2," Your job as a coach is to motivate players and to ensure they perform their very best. Being an effective coach means answering any questions players have.

, The more you know about softball, the rules of the game, proper form required in hitting, pitching, fielding, running and stealing bases, the more you educate players and teach them how to develop these skills. This ensures maximum performance.

, Keep in mind that every player's skill level is different. While there are a few players who are skilled way beyond their years, there are also players who are just learning how to play. The important thing is to treat players equally.

, Treat players equally and never show favoritism towards a particular player. This creates resentment and distrust among other players and creates disharmony within the team.

, Prevent from making rude comments or snide remarks to other players on the opposing teams. Always try to remain positive, even when the outcome doesn't.

Encourage players on the team.",How to Coach Girls Softball3," Have every team member participate in a song or rally prior to the game. Effective softball coaching techniques gets every player excited about playing the game.

, While everyone enjoys winning, it is not the only outcome of a game. Teach the players that the goal of the game is to do the best you can, have fun and always to be just as graceful when you win and when you lose.

, While it may get stressful at times, avoid yelling or embarrassing players on the field. If someone makes a mistake, instead of voicing your disapproval on the field, wait for the player to come to the dug out and pull them to the side to talk with her.

, When a player uses incorrect form or makes an error, help them correct these errors by showing them the proper way to perform this task. This is an effective softball coaching technique.

Get a warm cup of something.",How to Stay Warm at Work2," If possible, open the blinds to let in more light. The more sunlight you let in, the warmer your office will be. However, if sunlight doesn't stream in, opening the blinds may make your office colder, so only open them when the sun is on your side of the building., Obviously, if you're working a desk job, you can't be doing jumping jacks all day. However, taking periodic breaks to walk around the office can keep your blood pumping. While you're sitting at your desk, try lifting your legs up and down to keep moving., While warm beverages don't actually warm your core temperature (which is a good thing), they can make you feel warmer. Plus, they can keep your hands warm while you work. Try a warm cup of tea or coffee."

Try a hot water bottle.,
Use a heating pad.,
Use bigger headphones.,
Add a space heater.,
Try a heated chair mat.",How to Stay Warm at Work3," One way to gain warmth is to use an old-fashioned hot water bottle. You simply fill the bottle with hot water and then place it to add warmth. You can put it behind your back, for instance., Another option is to use a heating pad to warm up parts of your body. You'll need an outlet to plug it in, but then you can use it behind your back or underneath you to help stay warm.Never use a heating pad that looks worn or cracked. Burn marks are also a bad sign.
Be careful when using a heating pad, as it can burn your skin if left in one place for too long., Ear bud headphones may be unobtrusive, but they do nothing to keep you warm. Instead, opt for the bigger headphones that cover your whole ear. They'll add warmth and provide great sound quality., If your workplace allows it, you can try using a small space heater to help keep you warm. This solution works best if you have your own office, but if the heater is small enough, you may be able to make it work in a shared space.In fact, some companies make mini fan heaters just for this purpose.

, If layers aren't cutting it, add some warmth with a heated chair mat. These mats slip over the back of most office chairs and run down the back into the seat, much like a massage pad. They plug into a USB port, so you can simply plug it into your computer or a backup battery pack. Then it adds warmth to your back and legs."

Work hard at making a buddy who has the same hours as you. This can help provide you with social opportunities at times when your other friends and relatives are working or sleeping.
Spend the morning or evening with family and friends, so you do not miss them.;
, You will understandably need to sleep at ""odd"" hours, since you're working at night, but make sure you still get the sleep you need. Don't skip your precious rest time just because others are up and about. To help you sleep during the daytime, install 'blackout' shades and curtains in your bedroom. Use ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.

Avoid energy drinks and most supplements unless your doctor gives you the go-ahead. Our bodies sometimes ""crash"" when we run low on proper nutrients, and that can be draining.

, Employers usually allow one long break period for a meal, because it's the law, but you can actually adapt the whole break schedule to help yourself. If you eat part of your meal at each short break, your lunch period can become either a planning period or exercise time. Do not let labels dictate your health.

, Others might dislike the work and be negative about it, but that is their choice. If you are there, and you are earning money, do the best you can. You might notice that certain tasks are not being performed adequately. Volunteering to lend a hand is the right thing to do, as long as it doesn't interfere with the performance of your own duties. Volunteering might add to your on-the-job experience and even garner you a good reputation with your superiors.

, If your supervisor is wise, ask him or her for help. S/he might have a task that needs doing that would get you up and moving during your shift., Suggest a solution before it can become a serious problem.

Adjust chair height so that your feet are flat on the floor.,
Keep your wrist position neutral.,
Change your posture regularly.,
Make sure the other adjustments on your chair are correct for you, as well.,
Alternatively, stand.",How to Set Up an Ergonomically Correct Workstation1," This will keep your knees and hips at roughly the same height. To find this height, stand by the chair and raise or lower the seat pan to just below your elbows bent between 90 and 110 degrees. Take care that your elbows are not winged out, but instead hang with your upper arms at a comfortable, fairly vertical alignment. Your forearms should be parallel to the ground and your wrists in a neutral position. Since most desks are fixed height, it is best to adjust the chair height for the correct position of the arms and hands. Then, if necessary, provide support for the feet so that the underside of the thighs are just supported at the edge of the seat.


Some desks do adjust in height, so look to see if there is such an adjustment. Much modular office furniture (i.e. cubicles) allows for adjustment of work surface height, as well, although making this adjustment may require some work. Ask your employer or facilities department to help you adjust such a desk.;
, Avoid bending your wrist sharply upwards or downwards to type.


Consider split-design or tented-and-raised keyboard; otherwise, simply try to select one which is the right size for your hands.
To help your wrists âfloatâ over the keyboard, use a wrist rest; however, only use it if it actually elevates your wrists; depending on your position, this might actually encourage you to hold your hands at a bad angle.
Many keyboards have tabs to raise the back, but check your wrist position before you use them. You may need to raise the front, instead. If your keyboard has no such adjustment, try propping up the front on a paint stick, a couple of erasers, or other such object.

, Regardless of how healthy your work posture is, sitting in any one position for an extended period is not healthy. If you have an adjustable chair, alternate between the following positions, all of which will keep your pose neutral and relaxed:



Sit upright. Keep your torso roughly vertical, your thighs horizontal, and your lower legs vertical.

Sit reclined. Tilt the backrest of your chair back so that your torso reclines between 105 and 120 degrees from your thighs.

Sit declined. Tilt the seat pan of your chair slightly so that the angle between your thighs and torso is slightly more than 90 degrees. Donât overdo this or you will feel like youâre sliding.

, Most ergonomic office chairs have adjustments for arm rests, seat depth, spring stiffness of any reclining feature, seat angle, and more.

, If your desk is adjustable (or you can get another work station), stand. You can keep a footrest nearby and take turns resting your legs on it. Note that staying on your feet all day, while healthy, can make them sore; this position might be best for a job that doesnât require long periods at the desk (or can accommodate a small, secondary standing workspace).

Create the cover letter.,
Dial the fax number.,
Determine the feeding method.,
Fax the right material.",How to Send a Fax1," Fax machines are often shared by offices or several people within an office. Since anyone can see a fax sent to a fax machine, it is a good idea to include a cover letter. This will ensure that your fax gets to the correct person.


The cover letter includes information like the recipientâs name, the content of the fax, and how many pages it includes. It should also include the senderâs information, such as name and fax number, so that the recipient will know whom it came from and can reply if necessary.;
, Next, you will need to dial the fax number, just the same way you would on a telephone. On most new fax machines, the area code will not need to be dialed for a local number but is still necessary for long distance numbers. Some fax machines require the area code regardless of location. Check or ask about your machine.


The country code (the number 1 for US phones and fax numbers) will also sometimes need to be dialed before local numbers but only when the area code is also required. The country code is almost always necessary to dial long distance numbers.
You will often also need to dial 9 before dialing long distance numbers. Check the specifications for or ask about your individual fax machine.
Be sure that the number you are using is the fax number and not the phone number of the person you are trying to reach. Often the numbers will be listed next to each other on business cards and it is easy to misread it or look at the wrong number.

, When you put the materials to be faxed into the machine, you will need to put them in in the appropriate direction. The paper will be scanned, so if the paper is facing the wrong way only the back side will be scanned and the fax you send will be blank. Ensure that the papers a facing the right side up before sending the fax.


Different fax machines feed in different ways. Helpfully, all fax machines are labeled with the appropriate direction to place the papers. Somewhere near the area where you feed the paper, look for a symbol of a sheet of paper with a corner folded down. You will see on this symbol that one side of the sheet has lines and the other side is blank.

If the folded down corner has the lines, this mean the sheets must be fed into the fax machine with the blank side facing you.
If the folded corner is blank, this means you must feed the machine with the front side of the paper facing you.



, Fax machines work best with standard size paper. Sending anything in a non-standard size may not work or it may jam or harm your fax machine. If you need to send something of a non-standard size, such as a receipt copy, you will want to make a photocopy of the item first and fax the photocopy instead.


The most common size paper for fax machines, as with printers, is A4 or American letterhead.

If the depth of your desk doesnât allow this, move your monitor to a corner, request a flat screen monitor (if applicable), or purchase an attachable computer tray to create a deeper working surface.

, The monitor should always be directly in front of your face (preferably no more than 35 degrees to either side) and at or slightly below eye level. However, if you wear bifocals and usually tilt your head back in order to look down through them at the monitor, lower the monitor (or raise your chair) so that the monitor sits 15 to 20 degrees below eye level; note that this may require you to tilt the screen slightly upwards toward your face. Avoid the need to tilt the head back, causing tension in the neck and shoulders.

Keyboard trays can lower the keyboard and mouse, and help keep them within easy reach. Good ones allow you to adjust the position and angle, as well. Consider a keyboard tray, especially if you are shorter.

, Keep it in a position that will enable you to transition between typing and using the mouse with as little effect on your arm and wrist posture as possible. If you have a 10-key on the right side of your keyboard, you may want to use your mouse on the left side; this centers the part of your keyboard that you use most. You can also alternate left and right-sided mouse usage to dilute the effects of repetitive use.


Choose a mouse which is the right size for your hands. Don't rule out ""portable"" mice (if your hands are smaller) or ""gaming"" mice if your hands are larger. Try to find a shop where you can try out a variety of mice.
Adjust the mouse drivers in software, if you wish to change the speed of the cursor movement relative to the mouse movement. Adjust it so it feels right for you.

, If you have cables on your keyboard, mouse, or other peripherals, collect them so they are out of the way and do not pull against your work. Bundle monitor and other cables so they are out of the way.

, Place your phone, writing equipment, books and other frequently-used items within easy reach from where you sit. You should not need to stretch to reach frequently used objects.


If you use a document holder, do not place it to one side of your monitor (unless you also use a second one on the other side); turning your head in one direction for prolonged periods fatigues the neck muscles. Instead, position the document holder directly beneath the monitor, angling it between the monitor and keyboard. If you touch type and do a lot of transcription, consider placing the document holder in front of you, with the screen to one side. The main focus of attention is then straight ahead with occasional movements to view the screen. Another option would be to provide a lectern that is positioned between the keyboard and screen.

, If you spend a lot of time on the phone, a hands-free set will leave your hands for other tasks. It will also prevent awkward neck positions from perching a phone between your shoulder and your ear.

Use email to send a fax.",How to Send a Fax2," Once you have done everything listed above, you are ready to send your fax. With the paper properly inserted and the number dialed, you are ready to press send. This button will usually be large and well-labeled. Thatâs it! Youâve sent your fax!


You will notice that, after pressing send, the machine will make a series of beeps and whirring sounds. This is normal. These sounds are how the fax machines communicate with each other. When a fax has successfully gone through, you will usually hear a long, clear beep after a few minutes. When a fax encounters a problem and does not go through, you will usually hear it make a horrible sort of death-keen. If you hear this horrible sound, you should check on the fax machine to assess the problem.

, It is also possible to use the internet to send materials to a fax machine. There are a number of services which can be used, most of which cost money. This can be a wise investment, however, if you do not send faxes very often and do not wish to buy a fax machine or deal with services like FedEx.


PamFax is an excellent faxing service for Skype. This program charges a small fee, however.
HelloFax is a service which integrates well Google Drive, allowing you to easily fax Google documents. It includes a certain number of free faxes and then charges a fee.

, Depending on the number you are sending the fax to, it may be possible to simply email the file to the fax machine at no charge. However, you should keep in mind that this method only covers a limited number of fax numbers and can only send limited information.


You can check if the fax number is covered by looking online.Use this formula to create the address to which you will send the email: âremote-printer.First_Last@12345678910.iddd.tpc.intâ
Remove the quotations, exchange the numbers for the fax number (including country and area code), and first and last for the name of the person you are sending it to.
Note that only the text in the text box will appear on the fax. You cannot attach PDFs or any other material with this method.

Inspect your work.",How to Shrink Wrap a Pallet1," If you do not have heat-shrink bags and are using manually applied film, use the steps in the guide ""Preparing to Shrink-Wrap Using Manually Applied Film"" below.









Make sure that the bag is snug over the pallet and items. It does not need to be tight, but it shouldn't be too loose.
Tuck the excess plastic at the bottom of the bag around the corners and edges of the pallet.;
, Starting at the base, use your heat or shrink gun (or hairdryer, though it will be less secure and look less professional) to heat the plastic and cause it to shrink to the pallet and its items.As each heat or shrink gun will have different operating and safety guidelines, be sure to follow their included instructions. A video guide including this step is attached at the bottom of this guide.









After the base is secure, use your heating implement to secure the top of the bag to the items.
Once the base and top are secure, use a slow back-and-forth sweeping motion to seal each side of your pallet.
Each heating implement is different! Be sure to follow your separate instructions when it comes to operation, especially instructions which pertain to safety, how far to hold the shrink gun from the pallet, and how long to apply heat for.

, Being sure to first safely turn off and store your heating implement, you are now ready to inspect your work. A properly shrink-wrapped pallet should feel like a single unit, with no wobbling or instability of its contents. Congratulations! You have successfully shrink-wrapped a pallet.

Create a floor plan of your office space.,
Evaluate the space requirements of your workers.,
Compile a rough list of the cubicles needed.,
Prepare sketches of cubicle layouts on your floor plan.,
Reconcile your preferred layout with any utility constraints.",How to Set up Cubicles in an Office," Cubicle layout planning begins with an accurate floor plan of your space. If you have the necessary skills and software, you can create this plan in a CAD application; otherwise, you can create it using a sheet of gridded paper.


Begin by measuring the walls of your office space with a tape measure. Make notes of these measurements in a rough sketch on paper. Make sure to note the locations of doors, windows, columns, and partitions.
Determine an appropriate scale for your floor plan. Each grid square on the paper needs to represent a real-world dimension. For example, if your paper has 30 squares across each edge, and your office space is 60 feet (18.2 m) wide, then each gridline could represent 2 linear feet (0.6 m).
Draw the floor plan onto the grid paper. Be careful to maintain your scale throughout. Once you have finished with the floor plan, make several copies of it so that you can experiment with different cubicle layouts on each sheet.;
, Compile a list of your workers and what space requirements their job entails. If a worker needs a computer, a work surface, and some shelving, then a standard 6 x 6 ft or 8 x 8 ft (1.8 x 1.8 m or 2.4 x 2.4 m) cubicle will suffice. If a worker will spend most of their time out of the office, a smaller cubicle will be adequate. Call center or sales representatives will need only enough space for a phone and computer, and won't need as much storage space. Workers who need to collaborate closely with others might require cubicles with seating for 2.

, After assessing your workers' needs, you can create a list of needed cubicles. Note the required floor area of each cubicle as well as the total floor area needed. If this number is higher than your available office space, you will have to scale back your cubicle sizes.

, Working closely with your list of space requirements, begin sketching possible layouts on your gridded floor plans.


Consider clearances carefully. Walkways between rows of cubicles should be at least 3 feet (1 m) wide.
Evaluate which workers need to work with each other. Plan your layout so that workers who must collaborate or communicate often are positioned near each other.
Minimizing the space needed for walkways will maximize the floor area usable for cubicles. If space is at a premium, long rows of cubicles may be a better choice than small clusters that need clearance on all sides.

, You cubicle layout will need to be receptive to constraints involving electrical outlet locations and lighting.


Many cubicle panels are pre-wired and can be plugged into an electrical outlet, but you cannot run too many cubicles from a single outlet. Your layout will therefore need to optimize the use of all outlets in your space.
You also want your cubicles to be well-lit. Consider positioning cubicles underneath existing light fixtures to minimize the need for additional lighting within each cubicle. This will reduce energy consumption and its associated cost.
In addition to considering the existing light fixtures, make sure to utilize natural light as much as possible. Avoid blocking windows with cubicle partitions; opt instead to use lower partitions near windows.

Choose and prepare your PVC or polyolefin plastic film.,
Secure and wrap the base of the pallet.,
Make sure the base is strong.,
Continue upwards to wrap the rest of the items.,
Finish up wrapping.,
Heat the shrink-wrap, if necessary.",How to Shrink Wrap a Pallet2," Your pallet should be loaded per the instructions to stacking a pallet guide prior to applying film. Peel out approximately a yard of the plastic and squeeze 8 inches (20.3Â cm) or so of the end together into a loose rope.


PVC is the older, more common, and less expensive film. It is usually used to individually wrap items as it is more brittle than polyolefin.Polyolefin is newer and more expensive, but has less of an odor and is less brittle, making it a better choice for most heavy jobs., Starting by threading the ""rope"" end of your film in and around one corner of the pallet, wrap your film around the pallet and the base of the items that you have stacked on the pallet.You will want to keep the film tight without stretching or tearing it. Start slow until you get the hang of it.

, Always working in the same direction as you started, wrap the base enough times so that the plastic is snug. It should help by sticking to itself. Having a secure base is the most important part, so wrap it least four or five times. Make sure that the wrap goes around and under the corners of the pallet.

, Rotating in the same direction, move up as you wrap film around the pallet and items, this will secure all items to the base of the pallet. Each layer should be wrapped firmly do the one below it, and so on. Be sure to take as much stretch as possible out of the plastic film while you are wrapping.








, When you wrap the top of the pallet you can either end there or wrap back down the pallet again. If the job looks thin or loose, you will want to wrap back down to the base of the pallet. An insecurely wrapped pallet is a dangerous pallet. Once the pallet is firm, tear the film off of the roll and fold it under one of its own layers. This will keep your wrap job from coming undone.

, For most heavy or industrial jobs you will want to heat the shrink-wrap to stabilize the pallet and ensure the safety of both the items and any people that might be working with them. This is especially true if the pallet is going to be either transported or stored for an extended period of time.

Prepare your workspace.,
Stack the base of your pallet.,
Stack the rest of your pallet.",How to Shrink Wrap a Pallet3," You will want to be working in a clean, cool area with plenty of space on each side of the pallet to operate. You will want to be sure that your pallet is sturdy and the right size for all of your items.Using a pallet that is either too large or too small will result in an insecure load that is a hazard to both your items and you.

, If you are placing items of different sizes and weights on the pallet, be sure to put the largest and heaviest items on the bottom. Try to occupy as much space as possible without any gaps. Having a tight, secure base is essential to the stability of the pallet.


Don't leave too much space between your items and the corners of the pallet. This can cause the plastic to tear after shrink-wrapping.
Neatly organizing the base of your pallet will make the rest of your job much easier. Use time and take care on this step, and you'll be saving yourself time and energy in the long run.

, Place your remaining items on the pallet, organizing them in a stable way that occupies as much of the square footage of the base as possible without going over its edges. All items should be as close to one another as possible, with little or no space between them to shift.


Make sure that all items are stacked as closely and neatly as possible. If they are loose or unorganized they can shift within the shrink wrap, rendering it ineffective and potentially endangering both your items and people.
Don't stack your pallet too high. The ideal shape for a pallet is a cube. Stacking a pallet too high can make the pallet too big for a heat shrink bag and destabilize the load by raising the center of gravity.

Help them.",How to Get Someone Fired," Simply disliking a person personally is not reason enough to try to relieve them of a job. Remember that even if you and your co-worker don't get along, he or she may be relying on this job to provide for their family. Take some time to consider whether you really want to be responsible for taking that away from them. You have a good case if your coworker is:


Interfering with your ability to work
Interfering with someone else's ability to work
Stealing company time by being habitually late, lazy, or uncooperative
Creating a hostile or counterproductive work environment
Has sexually, physically, or verbally harassed you or another worker;
, Your argument will seem way more valid if you have the support of your other co-workers. Ask around to see if anybody else at work feels the same way that you do about this employee.


Go about this in a diplomatic way. Avoid spreading rumors or trying to convince people to start hating the co-worker in question. Instead, start by asking questions like, ""So, what do you think of the new clerk?"" or ""It's interesting listening to John speak to his clients on the phone."" or ""Did you happen to notice what time John got to work?""
If you find that one or more co-workers agree with your complaints, then ask whether he or she would be willing to join you in making a formal complaint.

, Pay attention to your co-worker's behavior at work so that you can have substantial evidence when you go to make a complaint, and keep a document of incidents. Pay attention to significant indiscretions and log them.


Keep a log of the times, dates, and detailed descriptions of these incidents so that your argument appears more valid and to give your manager something to work off of. This will be easiest if you work the same shifts as your co-worker, and work in the same general vicinity.
Try to distinguish between serious indiscretions that affect the work environment and more minor infractions. Failing to clean up the coffee station isn't as big a deal as showing up to work drunk.

, Use your best judgment to determine who the most appropriate person is for you to meet with regarding this matter. Plan on meeting in person, if possible.


Bring your written notes with you when you go to the meeting, as well as any other coworkers who also wish to complain.
Request that your complaint remain anonymous. This way, you will avoid making enemies with the co-worker in question.
Avoid making complaints via email, which are both easier to ignore and less formal than in-person meetings. That also leaves a paper trail of your complaint, which you may prefer to distance yourself from.

, Think through the points you'd like to make and practice reciting them in a calm tone of voice. If you're in the heat of frustration with the person, the boss might be more likely to assume this is an interpersonal matter you're blowing out of proportion, rather than a serious complaint you're making with the good of the company in mind.


Point out some of the person's good points: ""I like John, really. He's funny and I think he's a good guy and I hope he turns around, but I'm worried about him.""
Don't ask directly for the boss to fire the person. If your manager asks, ""What do you think I should do?"" feel free to make your preference known, but it's not your decision to make.

, Once you have made a formal complaint, it is no longer your responsibility to continue keeping tabs on this person or trying to get him or her fired. Go back to focusing on your own life both in and outside of work, and just try to stay away from the co-worker in question if he or she bothers you.

, Before resorting to blatant sabotage, help an incompetent co-worker sabotage him or herself.


If this person is consistently late to work, extend an invitation to a late night outing on a work night. Separately arrange a meeting for early the next morning with your supervisor, telling them that your coworker will be there. Show up bright-eyed and ready to work, acting confused as to why your coworker wouldn't show up for the meeting.
If your coworker has an issue with cursing in front of customers, invite your religious grandfather to bring a group of his church friends past when your coworker is working. Let them complain to the manager instead., Sometimes you just want to get rid of somebody. Time to channel your inner Jim Halpert and bring out the nukes. Be extremely careful if you attempt to manipulate things to Try to get someone fired, or you could be the one who ends up getting sacked.


Order adult products to your coworker's work address, but leave off the suite number so that the delivery person has to make a big deal of searching for it. The more inappropriate, the better.
Hop on your coworker's computer and send lewd, but believable emails to your boss.
Change their computer desktop to porn while they're away. Tell your boss you want to meet with him at your coworker's desk right at the beginning of the day, before they've gotten the chance to notice it.

, While it may be your first reaction to want to get your coworker straight-up canned, any scenario in which they leave the job is good for you. Maybe that means recommending them for a new job you think they'll be attracted to, or continually talking to them about how bad the job is, convincing them to quit. If they think they're acting in their own best interest, you're doing everyone a favor.

Plan your story before speaking with anyone.,
Consider choosing a distant relative.,
Decide how to tell the story.,
Call in to work.,
Tell your boss in person.,
Write an email.,
Be prepared to show proof.,
Schedule your day off!,
Read your employee handbook.,
Find out if the time off is paid.,
Check how long youâve been with the company.,
Ask people around the office.",How to Get a Day off Work by Pretending You've Experienced a Death," You are likely to get many questions about your deceased loved one, so make sure that the story is believable. Get your facts straightened out, stay focused, and think about how youâre going to speak about the death., Telling your boss that your close relative or spouse has died could lead to problems if the person texts your or shows up at your job! By choosing a distant relative you barely know, there's little chance for a slip up. Choose a great-grandmother instead of your mother, or your cousin instead of your sister.

, Whether you send an email, call in or talk to your boss face to face, there will be a different set of clues that tell them youâre lying. Your voice, facial expression or demeanor could all be tips that the story is fake.

, Because theyâll only have your voice as a clue to whether youâre lying, rather than your eye contact or facial expressions, this may be the best option.


Say: âIâve had a death in the family and you will need some time off.â
Answer any questions your boss may have and keep it short. Stay consistent with the story you made up.
Try to sound sad, and if you want, sniff and cough often to make it sound as though youâve been crying.

, It may help story come across as more sincere and it might fit with your story better if the fake death happens during work. It's morally questionable to lie to your boss, especially to their face, but if you stay relaxed you can avoid being caught.


Tell your boss about the situation, and ask for time off.
Maintain eye contact with your boss, and think about how they may perceive your body language.Steady eye contact and relaxed, but slouched posture will help your boss think that youâre both telling the truth and genuinely sad.
Make yourself cry if you think it is appropriate. Think of a truly sad thought or stare at a bright light until your eyes begin to water before you meet with your supervisor., If you send an email, thereâll be practically no way for your boss to know if youâre lying or not. Emailing isnât an acceptable method for skipping work at many companies, but if itâs alright, write a short, succinct email about the death and that you need a few days off., Many employers will be more than happy to let you take time off for a death, but others may be more skeptical. If they ask for proof, be prepared to back it up with some falsified evidence, but be very careful as you'll only make the lie more offensive if you're caught.


Find an obituary in a local paper that matches the story you told. You'll be moving even further in a morally wrong direction, but if an obituary seems close enough, you can turn that in to your boss as is. Itâs also possible to photoshop an obituary by taking the existing text and adding the right name in the same font.
For a really gutsy move, fake a death certificate. Death certificates are available online, and need only to have their information changed in Photoshop or Paint. Be aware that this could lead to serious repercussions if you're caught, and could be illegal depending on where you live! , Once your boss is satisfied with the information youâve given, work with them to determine which days youâll take off, including a day for the funeral.

, There will often be information in the handbook about how absences are handled in the case of death. Whether itâs a few days or a whole week, itâll be important to know how much time you can expect to take off. Two or three days is the norm in the United States. , If youâve used up paid sick days and are trying to fake a death to get paid days off, youâll need to make sure that bereavement time is paid by your company. Many companies offer paid time off, but in America, there is no federal law mandating that you receive it. , Many companies do not offer any paid time off, even for a death in the family, if you havenât been with the company for a long time.

, Be very careful not to arouse suspicion of what youâre planning to do, but ask close coworkers if theyâve ever taken bereavement leave and see how easy it is to get.

Consider thinning the ink out inside.,
Consider refilling the ink with fresh ink.,

Know what to do if the ball point is simply stuck.",How to Restore Your Dried up Correction Ink2," Sometimes, it's just a thin layer of ink that has dried over the nib, and the ink inside the pen is just fine.

, If there is dried ink covering the nib, use your fingernail to gently scratch the ink off. A thin layer of dried ink can prevent fresh ink from flowing out.

, This will help dislodge any blockage that is inside the ink. Once you have given the pen a few shakes, try drawing with it and seeing if any ink comes out.

, This may require you to remove the top and bottom sections, depending on how the pen is designed. Use something long and thin, such as a knitting needle or a chopstick to remove the clot.

, You can use a few drops of water or a non-acetone nail polish remover.

, If the ink inside the pen has mostly dried out and you can't restore it, you can try pouring in fresh correction ink. Get a bottle of white correction ink, and pour a little bit into the pen capsule.

, If necessary, seal any parts that don't stay together with super glue.

, Sometimes, a correction ink pen won't write simply because the little ball in the tip is stuck. You can loosen it in two ways:


Draw circles with it in a small puddle of olive oil or baby oil.
Soak the tip in a cup of warm water for about 10 minutes.

"
"
Keep the lid on the bottle when you are not using it.,
Keep a correction pen capped.,
Consider wiping the inside neck of the bottle with nail polish remover.,
Consider cleaning the nib of a correction ink pen from time to time.,
Store correction ink pens upright in a jar.,
Keep the correction fluid in a cool, dry place.",How to Restore Your Dried up Correction Ink3," Any air that gets into the bottle will cause the ink to harden and dry. The longer you leave the bottle open, the thicker the ink will become.

, Even though the ink is inside the pen capsule, you'll still want to keep the cap on. Not only will this prevent the pen from leaking, but it will also keep ink from drying out on the nib too fast. It the ink dries on the nib, you might end up with a blockage.

, From time to time, you might want to open up your bottle of correction fluid, and wipe the neck part, right where the threads are. Soak a folded paper towel with some nail polish remover and wipe it around the neck. This will remove any excess ink that might have dried up on the neck of the bottle. It will help keep the cap tightly closed and prevent any air from getting inside.

, Every so often, run the pen across some paper. You can also scratch off any ink that is starting to dry on the ball point with your fingernail. This will help prevent any blockages.

, The tip should be pointing upward. If you store it on its side or upside down, the ink may flow into the nib and dry out.

, Keep it out of sunlight and heat, as both can cause the ink to dry and harden.

Address bullying behaviors immediately.,

Encourage management and staff interaction.",How to Deal with Workplace Bullying and Harassment," Just like their immature little brothers and sisters on the schoolyard, workplace bullies use same tools of intimidation and manipulation to bring you down. Learning to recognize their behavior is the first step in putting a stop to it and getting back to work in a comfortable environment.


A bully gains enjoyment from tormenting others. You might not always get along with everyone at work, but that doesn't mean you've got a bully on your hands any more than you're a bully yourself. Distinguish between the two by recognizing this trait--does this person seem to make special effort in messing with you, tripping you up, or bringing you down? Do they seem to enjoy it? If the answer is yes, this might suggest a bully.
Bullies often have deep-seated psychological issues related to control. Know that your bullying has less to do with your performance and your personality and more to do with the bully's insecurities.;
, Watch for the sure signs of a bully that signify more than a simple misunderstanding or personal disagreement. Workplace bullying might include:


Shouting, whether in private, in front of colleagues, or in front of customers
Name-calling
Belittling or disrespectful comments
Excessive monitoring, criticizing, or nitpicking someone's work
Deliberately overloading someone with work
Undermining someone's work by setting them up to fail
Purposefully withholding information needed to perform a job efficiently
Actively excluding someone from normal workplace/staff room conversations and making someone feel unwelcome

, You might be suffering from bullying if you suffer at home in the following ways:


You have trouble sleeping or struggle with nausea and vomiting because you're scared to go to work
Your family gets frustrated because of how much you talk and obsess about work problems
You spend days off worrying about going back to work
Your doctor notices health problems like blood pressure and other stress concerns
You feel guilty about having provoked your workplace troubles

, If you feel singled out unfairly, or as if you're picked on a disproportionate amount, it can be tempting to come up with excuses. ""Everyone gets treated this way,"" or ""I deserve it"" are common guilt trips that bullies help to lay on you. Don't fall into a trap of self-loathing if you feel you're being bullied. Form a plan to stop the bullying and reclaim your workplace.Unlike schoolyard bullies, who tend to pick on victims they identify as alone or weak, workplace bullies typically pick on employees they consider threatening to their career. If your presence makes someone else look bad enough they feel the need to take you down, take it as a twisted compliment. You're good at what you do. You know this. Don't let them confuse you.

, This is, of course, more difficult than it sounds, but you can keep a few simple gestures and statements in mind to bring out when you're feeling bullied.


Put your hands up, creating a barrier between you and your bully, like a policeman using the stop signal with his hand.
Say something short that communicates your frustration, like: ""Please stop and let me work"" or ""Stop talking please."" This will help you to stand up to the behavior and give you ammunition for your report if the behavior continues.
Never escalate the bullying. Shouting counter insults or yelling back might end up getting you in trouble or making the situation worse. Use a calm, collected tone of voice, and tell the person to stop as if you were talking to a dog chewing on a slipper.

, Record the name of your tormentor and the method of bullying. Record specific times, dates, locations, and the names of any witnesses to the events. Provide and gather as much information as you can. Collecting documentation is the most important and concrete way to get the bullying to stop when you take the issue to your superiors or a legal team.


Even if you're not sure you're being bullied, journaling about your feelings in a diary can help you to get your feelings out and figure out for yourself what you're struggling with. As a result of writing down your feelings and your frustrations, you might decide you don't have a bully, or that you definitely do and you need to take action.

, Consult with your fellow co-workers any time you feel bullied and make sure they'll back you up by corroborating your evidence. Have them write it down for future reference. Pick someone who works at the same time you do, or who has a desk near yours.


If bullying tends to happen at particular times or in particular locations, have your witness linger in the area if you suspect you're going to be tormented by your bully. Bring partners into a meeting with a superior who you feel bullies you. You'll have backup in case things get ugly and you'll have evidence for later.
If you're being bullied, there's a good chance others are too. Team up and help each other deal with a common enemy.

, Make sure that you've collected your evidence and that you're calm and professional. Running to your boss in the throes of emotional turmoil can make you seem whiny, or like you're overreacting, when there's a bigger issue at hand. If you're calm, you'll be more articulate, present a better case for yourself, and stand a better chance of changing your workplace for the better.


Wait overnight between a bullying situation and reporting things to your boss. If you're bullied in the mean time, or if you have to wait a while before talking to your boss, do your best to avoid your bully. Remain calm and continue on your way. If you expect bullying might happen, you'll be prepared when it does.

, Bring your written evidence, your witnesses, and present your case as calmly as you can. Practice what you're going to say before you get in there and have to say it. Keep your complaint short and sweet, and fill out any documentation paperwork provided for you by your superiors.


Don't suggest a course of action unless your boss requests it. In other words, it's inappropriate to talk to your boss and say, ""Bruce needs to get fired because he bullies me."" Lay out your case as strongly as possible and with as much incriminating evidence as you can, say, ""I'm frustrating with this behavior and I've run out of options, so I thought you needed to know."" Let your superiors come to their own conclusions about a course of action.
If your superior is the one bullying you, contact HR or contact your supervisor's superiors. It's not the army and there is no ""chain of command."" Talk to someone who can make a difference.

, If the bullying continues and it still hasn't been sorted out and nothing is being done to stop it, you have the right to take it further and go higher up, by talking to higher management, personnel and even HR (Human Resources). Continue until your complaint is taken seriously and the situation is remedied to allow you to work in a welcoming environment.


It would be helpful to come up with a variety of alternatives to help make the situation better for you. If your boss's supervisor is unwilling to fire your boss but acknowledges that bullying has occurred, are you willing to transfer? Are you willing to work from home? What would make the situation ""right"" by you? Give it some alternatives serious thought in case you need to present a case for yourself.
If you present evidence and nothing changes or the situation becomes worse, consult a lawyer and consider legal action. Provide them with documentation and seek legal action.

, You won't be any good as a worker and you won't be happy as a person if you don't take the time to recover from your experience with bullying. Take some time off and ignore work for a while.If you've presented a good case for yourself, you should be a good candidate for a paid vacation. Jump on this opportunity.

, It's called work, not super-happy-fun-time, for a reason. Any job, even one at a healthy workplace that you enjoy, can get to you after a while and leave you in need of a vacation that rejuvenates your work ethic and your spirit. If you've been bullied and want to start feeling better, you might:

Socialize with friends and family

, You might be in need of more substantial care than you can provide by yourself. Therapy or medication might be in order if you've spent a considerable amount of time in the grip of a workplace bully.

, It may be that, even if the bully has been dealt with, you might be more comfortable seeking new opportunities elsewhere. Treat this whole experience as an opportunity rather than a setback. If you were unhappy at your place of work, maybe developing skills in a new profession, moving to a different climate, or just transferring to a new branch might provide you with a fresh outlook on life and work., Any health and wellness policy needs to involve anti-bullying protocols. Make sure this is covered and supported by the management and is taken seriously at all levels of the business.


Pair this with an open door policy and hold frequent orientation meetings regarding workplace bullying, making sure employees at all levels are on the look out for this behavior.

, It's easy to sit back and hope for the best, thinking that your employees will be able to work it out among themselves. It won't. Don't let a problem fester among your employees if you want a productive, healthy, and effective work environment.


Investigate all complaints seriously and fully. Even if complaints seem to come from overly sensitive employees and turn out to be the result of simple misunderstandings, they're worthy of your attention.

, Often bullying evolves from a sense of competition in the workplace, leading employees who feel threatened by the skills of other employees to attempt to bring them down or sabotage their efforts by engaging in psychological warfare. It's a dangerous and problematic workplace dynamic to let fester.


Workplace competition is based on the belief that employees want to be the best and will work harder when rewarded for successes. While it's true that competition in some business models can increase productivity, it also increases the turnover of employees and can create a hostile and unwelcoming environment., The more involved your workforce is at all levels with itself, the less likely the lowest-level workers are to take matters into their own hands. Think of it as Lord of the Flies--don't let the parents be absent from the island, and the kids will be ok.

Make a plan.,
Find good experiences in your work.,
Practice problem solving.,
Imagine that you are protected by a shield.,
Practice gratitude.,
Think about your salary.",How to Distract Yourself From a Job You Hate1," One way to make your job more tolerable is to look at what you are hoping to gain from it in the long run, such as skills or experience, and making a plan to attain that goal. Is this job a stepping stone to another job? Do you need the experience for your resume? Or are you hoping that a better position will open up at the company that you can apply for? Identify your main reason for needing the job and then make a plan to help you work towards it.


For example, if it is your intention to apply for a different job after you have at least a year of experience in this position, then you might plan to stick with your job for seven more months to get the experience you need.;
, Just because work is not your favorite experience, that doesnât mean that it canât be good experience. You can learn as much from a job you hate as a job you love, and what you learn can be the difference in getting a better job or not. Take advantage of things like optional trainings, continuing education, and professional development programs. These opportunities will help you build your resume and your network.For example, if your office offers a training on how to use a new piece of software, take the training. Even if you donât use it in this job, it can help you land a new job that you enjoy more.

, Many times, people obsess about minor problems. Something as simple as being displeased with the type of toilet paper at work can be mulled over so many times that you dread going altogether. Practice solving as many problems as you can, so that your day is as enjoyable as possible. For example, if the toilet paper is a serious issue, bring your own toilet paper instead of dreading your workday.There are also efficiency problems in most work scenarios. For example, your office might use much more paper than it actually needs. Analyze the situation and come up with a plan to be more conservative on paper.
Even if you canât problem solve your way out of hating your job, it is good practice for mitigating problems in a future job that you do enjoy. It will also distract you from the job you hate in the meantime.

, An inconsiderate boss, demanding coworkers, or other emotional hurdles can make it hard to deal with work sometimes. Try to imagine that you are surrounded by a protective shield each time you enter your workplace.Take a moment before entering your place of work every day to put on your psychic armor. Imagine a solid shield going up around your whole body, or imagine putting on full plate armor that will protect your from any unpleasantness throughout your day.
Any time something happens that is frustrating or upsetting, remind yourself that you are well-protected and imagine that it is bouncing off of your shield or armor.

, Taking a few minutes every day to practice gratitude can help you to feel happier as you go through your day.Try jotting down five things that you are grateful for at the beginning of your workday every day. As the day goes on, keep adding to this list as you think of more things you feel grateful for.


The items you list can be small or large. For example, you might include on your list things like, a hot cup of coffee, no traffic on your way to work, a compliment that a coworker gave you, a pleasant smelling air freshener on your neighborâs desk, or an upcoming long weekend.

, Very few people work in their positions purely for the love of their work. Most people work where they work because it pays them something. You probably fall into this category, and focusing on your paycheck might help to distract you from how much you hate the work you do to earn it."

Socialize with coworkers.,
Do something relaxing or refreshing.,
Make a game out of your work.,
Try jotting down details about what your ideal job would be.,
Apply to other jobs.,
Seek inspiration.",How to Distract Yourself From a Job You Hate2," Your coworkers provide an easily accessible means of distraction. You can talk and socialize with them, and in many cases even claim the distraction as being âwork-related.â Socializing with your coworkers can also give you the opportunity to build your network, which will help when seeking a promotion or another job.Keep in mind that your coworkers are there to work as well. They may enjoy their job, or have a family that depends on their income. When someone is busy with work, avoid interrupting them. Constantly interrupting coworkers will annoy them and is inappropriate.

, If the work day seems to drag on, then doing little things to break up the day and make work less stressful can help. Try getting up for frequent breaks if you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, or do some exercises at your work station to help break up your day and reduce stress.


Head to the water cooler often for a drink of water.
Stand up and stretch or walk around to get your blood flowing.
Take a walk around the neighborhood during your lunch break.
Do some deep breathing or meditate for a few minutes.

, People often get bored at work because the work itself is dull or monotonous. If this is the case, try making a game out of it. Create rules and challenges that force you to do your work in a more creative and interesting way.


For example, if your job is to enter data into Excel, then try timing yourself for 15 minutes to see how many entries you can make in that time frame. Then, after timer is up, reset it and try to break your previous record.

, Since you have a job that you do not like, you may find it easy to identify what you want from a job. Try keeping a piece of paper handy and, as you go through your day, jot down what features you hope your dream job will have.


For example, you might jot down things like, âbetter cash incentives for sales,â âa supportive boss who treats me with respect,â âa pleasant workplace,â âflexible hours,â âweekends off,â etc.

, If you are unhappy in the job you currently hold, it is time to start considering the next step. You can make your days at work go by considerably faster if you spend any free time (or make free time) to look for jobs youâd rather have. Most jobs will require some sort of application and/or resume, and you can polish these things up at your current job to distract yourself.

, Being inspired can distract you from how much you hate your work. Read quotes or blogs that motivate you, talk to your coworkers about their accomplishments or desires, or write your own inspiring pieces. Doing so will help you get through the day to day job that you hate.You should be cautious while doing this. If your boss and/or coworkers see you, they may feel that you are not doing your job and be upset with you.

Negotiate changes.,
Work towards a new position.,
Push yourself to do your current work better.,
Maintain your personality.",How to Distract Yourself From a Job You Hate3," People are never happy when they feel taken advantage of or undervalued. If these are the reasons that you hate your job, you should come up with a plan to negotiate changes. Sit down and make a list of the changes that would make you happy in the position you hold. This will distract you from your current circumstances, as well as paint a picture of better working conditions. Approach your boss and suggest the changes. Even if they arenât implemented, the meeting will get you away from your normal work for a bit.For example, you could set up a meeting with your boss and start off by saying something like âI appreciate all of the opportunities that the company has given me over the past two years that I have been an employee. Having taken all of those opportunities enthusiastically has allowed me to build my skill set and handle more responsibility for the company. Unfortunately, I do not feel like my pay has raised appropriately to reflect the job that I now do.â

, Keep in mind that your job does not have to be permanent. Fantasizing about a better position can keep you distracted from the work that you hate. Another approach is to channel your attention away from âwhatâ you are doing and into âhowâ doing it will get you a better job.New positions often come with more responsibility. To show that you are ready for such responsibilities, volunteer to take on projects or help someone who is struggling in your department. This will stand out to your boss and show your ability to be a leader.

, Being underchallenged day in and day out is enough to make anyone hate their job. Push yourself to take on a new project, or complete your current projects in a more effective way. This will make you think critically and creatively, and distract you from the boring ins and outs of every day. It will also build good habits for your future employment.For example, if you create spreadsheets to list businessesâ contact information, push yourself a step further and hyperlink out to their websites, or to other relevant businesses within the spreadsheet.

, You likely know the saying âWhen in Rome, do as the Romans,â or some version of it. While this holds true to some degree in the workplace, you should still be yourself. Put your personal flare into your work and distract yourself from the monotony of the work.For example, if you design a flyer for your company, you should look at it not only as an employee, but as a person as well. This will allow you to understand how the flyer âfeelsâ to people like yourself, and give you the insight to tweak it into being more appealing.

Think about where you want to take your career.,
Look up work-related opportunities to travel.,
Have the right credentials and certification.,
Familiarize yourself with the diseases prevalent in the country of travel.,
Make sure your physical examination records are up to date.,
Familiarize yourself with the culture of your place of travel.,
Take an absence for the time you will be gone.,
Plan an itinerary.,
Think about leaving a couple earlier than the required date.,
Inform your current patients.,
Find someone you trust to look after your home.,
Pack.,
Do not forget the essentials on International travels.,
Get going!",How to Fit Travel Into Your Medical Career," The first step is to think about what exactly you want to do with your medical certification. You should consider whether you would want the traveling lifestyle or not, and if you would need to decide if you'd be comfortable moving around a lot. Traveling for medical purposes allows you to have a more direct impact on a person's life. If traveling is something you are interested in doing, the next step is to branch out and find opportunities that would allow you to do so.;
, You should do some research on different reasons to travel in your specialization like research on the Internet or talking to your superiors. When looking for opportunities, consider how far and how frequent you would need to travel. Missionary trips like Doctors without Borders are popular for physicians. The physicians go to developing areas of the world to treat patients that don't have much or any access to health care.If you sign up to be a part of a frequent medical-travelling agency, begin accepting assignments to travel and begin giving medical care to other people. These assignments are often four-to-six month contracts. Domestic placements can be as short as a weekend and international placements can be up to two years long, so make sure to plan accordingly and look at the requirements for the organization you decide to work through. Once you find a group that does missionary trips, you sign up for it and start planning!

, If you are a physician going on a medically related trip, make sure you have an appropriate work visa if you are planning on traveling outside of your country. There is a booklet to refer to, as indicated in the picture.

, Be aware of all of the risks, health-associated, that could occur. Certain Urgent Care centers administer respective vaccinations to the place of travel. It is important to give yourself this time because vaccines require time to take effect within the body. Especially if you are flying out of country, this is even more important.

, If you are heading outside of the country, check to see if you are up-to-date with your vaccinations. Initial consultation at a travel medicine clinic should occur at least four to six weeks before you departure to give yourself time to get your immunizations and, if need be, any assessments in case an adverse reaction occurs.

, The physician or future physician should know the local patientâs language to understand them effectively and be able to provide the needed care. He or she should also be aware of the local religious believes, which sometimes affect the patient treatments. Looking for the ""WORLDBOOK"" encyclopedias in your library is a good place to start.

, Once you know your date of travel, it is important to notify your boss and your colleagues that you will be out of town on a medical trip. This is necessary to ensure that people who might be trying to get a hold of you while you are gone know that it is highly unlikely for them to receive a prompt response to whatever it is that they needed for you, whether it be a consult or help on a case. It is considered appropriate to let your workplace know a month prior to the day you leave. Block the days you will be absent in your calendar so no future appointment are made for those dates that you will be gone.

, When it is time to travel for your missionary or your volunteer medical trip, it is important to buy a plane ticket or other mode of transportation as soon as possible. Look to see if you know others within the trip who are going with you and book a flight together.

, Sometimes it may be good to get to the location a couple of days before in order to get accustomed to the new environment, the new people, and local grocery stores that you will need to buy food from. Make sure that, along with booking transportation, you do not forget to book a place to stay as well. If going overseas, you should probably set up a means for people to contact you in an emergency.

, For the patients, explain to them that you will be going out for medical relief trip for however long you are going for. Make sure that your patient is offered a chance to re-schedule their appointment with you for a later time or, if the appointment was to occur on a timely manner, refer him or her to another colleague with the similar certification and specialization as you for this one appointment.

, If you will be gone for a significant period of time, you should probably find someone to take care of your house if you have houseplants and/or pets. Having some body look after your house is also good for security purposes in case anything goes wrong while you are away. Also, coming back to a clean house gives you a good feeling after being away from it after a while.

, For a domestic flight: As the day of your flight approaches, you should pack your bags in advance to assure that you do not forget any of the essentials like your toothpaste, toothbrush, hair comb, etc. Keep in mind restrictions on carrying things on flights like toothpaste tube sizes, gel bottle sizes etc. Planning packing methods helps to save money on luggage fees. Make sure that you have a ride to the airport so you can save on parking fees.

, If traveling abroad, make a checklist of important documentations and other things.

, Double-check to make sure you have not left any loose ends before you leave on your medical trip. Print your boarding pass ahead of time. Check-in over the computer within 24 hours of your flight! Now you are ready to go! Safe travels!

Consider that even without dramatic change, a good business is always progressing incrementally, improving the way that it works, improving the delivery of services, improving the types of products it sells, etc.,
Realize that we all change, including the workplace.,
Consider whether you're now feeling out of your comfort zone.,
Consider whether you're so tied up in your own sense of what is right that you have become rigid and unable to see when change is good.,
Spend time learning about the changing values.,
Get inter-generational.",How to Deal With Working for an Organization With Changing Values," Without such incremental progress and refinement of values over time, an organization risks stagnating. As such, be prepared for some change as a constant, including small realignments of values and approaches.;
, Would you want to be pigeonholed into one way of being over the decades? Or would you rather that people acknowledged the growth and changes that have constituted your self over time? Most people realize that evolution of both organizations and individuals is a healthy process provided it is an improvement in most respects.

, Has the organization's values, ethics and future orientation changed so much that you feel out of your comfort zone and unable to adjust to the changes? It's important to give it some time before assuming that the changes aren't going to work for you. However, if after several months of trying to adjust to the new way of thinking and doing things, you still feel adrift and disconnected, it's possible that the fit really is now an imperfect one.


If the difference between your values and those of the organization is too serious to overcome for you, it's time to leave.
If it's merely about the discomfort of change and a new emphasis on how to do things and how to approach old methods, then give it time. Avoid challenging people using your discomfort; get on with your work and speak to someone who is able to listen to your concerns, such as a family member or a therapist. The distance from the organization will make them sympathetic, neutral and less-entangled listeners.

, If you have been used to implementing a lot of the actions and telling the organization how things are, and this is suddenly removed from you, it can be deflating and disorienting. However, it can also be your next best challenge to grow and to start realigning yourself with the new values and the new thinking. Are you up for that?

, Sometimes the fear of what the values mean causes employees and managers to focus more on the perceived (and not necessarily yet realized) consequences and less on the substance of changing values. Instead of worrying, do your research and learn as much as you can about what seems to be the new direction of your organization. Apply your intelligence, your analysis and your future thinking to the new set of rules, guidelines, values and ideas and find ways that you can contribute to what's current. Be supportive and keep your criticism to yourself.

, Talk to people in generations above or below your own to see how they're embracing the changing values. They may have useful perspectives that you can learn from.


Holding on to old values can be career limiting. There is a difference between fundamental principles and simply old habits.

Research relevant policies.,
Learn about the HR manager's job.,
Conduct follow up research.,
Recognize professional limitations.,
Talk to the HR manager directly.,
Listen to the HR manager.,
Ask them to provide facts.,
Ask your HR manager why they are not prepared to assist.,
Remain calm and professional.,
Seek out other human resources employees to help you with your issue.,
Consult with your direct manager.,
File a complaint.,
Seek review of the role of the HR manager.",How to Deal With a Weak Human Resources Manager," When you have a discussion with HR you will need to bring your facts to the table. This means taking the time before a conversation to make sure that you have your facts straight. This could mean researching policies and laws, having a clear understanding of an incident and talking to witnesses, or getting examples of when the changes you are requesting have been implemented in other departments or companies.For example, if you are asking for a pay raise in order to be paid on par with others in your field, you need to prove that what you are asking for is actually what people are being paid.
Compile your research into a format that you can present to the HR manager. Make the presentation format as clear as possible. For example, highlight pertinent information if a page is full of facts and figures.;
, Perhaps you are asking the human resources manager for something that is not in their job purview. In order to assess whether the manager is not doing their job or if you needed to go elsewhere for support to begin with, you should understand the job of a human resources manager, and a human resources worker in general.Human resources departments deal with the employees of a company. In most cases they are central to hiring and recruiting, firing, employee pay and benefits administration, developing morale and training programs, and disputes between employees.
Depending on the size of your company and its structure, the job of the HR department can differ.

, If you bring up an issue or problem with an HR manager and they respond with excuses or resistance to your proposed solutions, then you may need to do more research to back up your position. Don't assume that you will not be able to revisit an issue after your initial round of research and discussion.


For instance, if you bring up a solution to a problem that you find out is against company policy, you may need to leave the meeting, do some research on that policy, and return to the topic once you are better versed in the issue.
If you have a frustrating conversation with an HR manager be prepared to go away and see if you can find the holes in their reasoning. Come back with well-argued challenges to this if you still think they are not doing their job.

, It may be that you are stuck with someone who is inexperienced, does not yet understand your particular workplace or jurisdiction, or who is overwhelmed by too much work. Occasionally, but less often, you are dealing with someone who is simply lazy or makes arbitrary delineations as to who does what. In the latter case, knowing your rights is very important.


Most HR managers will have had experience in the HR field before being promoted to the role of manager. Perhaps a new manager has experience in one aspect of HR and not in others. Keep this in mind and remember that it can take awhile to get up to speed in the diverse role of manager.If you have a pressing issue and your HR manager is inept, then you will need to go elsewhere to get your issue dealt with. You are entitled to responsiveness. If this HR manager cannot deliver, ask for one who can or ask for the manager to receive further training as to his or her role.

, Tell them what you need and how you feel that they are not helping with your situation. If you talk to this person tactfully and respectfully, they will usually appreciate this feedback and may not even have realized how you felt.


For example, say to the manager, ""I am continuing to have difficulty getting the proper health benefits instated and I need you to complete the paperwork so the issue can be resolved.""
Be reasonable. Always make sure you are not asking for them to give you the moon when your position can only provide the clouds.
The truth is that many HR managers are not sure what an employee thinks their role actually is and can sometimes give you the wrong answer inadvertently or simply not perceive the problem properly.

, When they answer your questions and discuss the situation, be an active listener. Really focus on everything that they are saying instead of picking out pieces that irritate or upset you.


Listening really actively could help you understand the HR manager's position or it could give you information you need to change the manager's position.
Some ways to show that you are listening include making eye contact, nodding, and paraphrasing what the other person says., If you are told something cannot be done, ask for the policy documents and the legislative background to be provided to you so that you can fully understand the issue. Often, this will be enough to alert the HR manager that you are not going away in a hurry. For example, if your HR manager has told you that there is a policy that blocks the change you have requested, simply say, ""I would like to see that policy in writing so that I fully understand what it is outlining and prohibiting.""
Asking for documentation can make a human resources manager more responsive to your needs. However, if they are very weak, they may just refuse or ignore your request.
It is a good idea to make your request in writing, usually over email. This will make a digital record of your request that you can prove if the problem continues unresolved.

, Explain clearly why you feel it is their role and not yours to pursue an employment matter and find a solution. Listen to their reasons as to why they perceive this situation differently. Ask them who they think should be dealing with your issue, if not them.


If you are at an impasse, you may need to say to the HR manager, ""I understand that you will not address this issue. Who can you suggest that would have the authority to address my concerns?""
Remember that the HR manager works for the employer, not you. Ultimately, they are looking after the best interests of the company. This may be why they are not addressing your issue but in most cases they cannot say this to you directly., When discussing problems or issues with an HR manager it is important to have a calm and professional conversation no matter what you are discussing. Remember that you are at your place of business and you are a professional, no matter how the HR manager acts.


Do not make the conversation personal or antagonistic, as this will not help your case or your relationship with the manager.
In order to remain calm, you need to be able to identify when you are feeling overwhelmed. Then, when you feel it coming on, you will be able to take a few seconds to take deep breaths and to calm your mind before continuing.

, If the manager of the human resources department is not able to help you with an issue you have, perhaps there is someone under their employ that can. A weak human resources manager often has employees that take up the slack, so they may be better able to than the manager can.


In a large organization, there may be more than one human resources managers.If this is the case, you can search for a different HR manager to deal with your issue.
Figure out what human resources employee deals, even peripherally, with your issue. For example, if you have an issue or a question about your employee benefits than you will need to figure out who directly deals with benefits and go to them for advice or help.

, If your problem or issue does not involve your manager, you can explain the problem to them and ask them to intervene. There may be something going on at a senior level that you are not able to fathom clearly but your manager may be able to address it.


In some cases, if you are having an issue that HR is unwilling to address, an upper level employee will have more luck demanding that the issue is addressed.
If your issue is with your direct supervisor, and HR is unwilling to address your concerns, then you will need to schedule a meeting with your supervisor's supervisor. This is the person, other than a strong HR manager that you don't have, that can address your concerns.

, If you aren't getting anywhere despite discussing the issue with the human resources department and your management they you will need to address it another way. File a complaint internally about not getting the employment support you need. Only do this after you have really tried to work it out through all avenues because this method should only be one of last resort.


Be aware that filing a complaint can cause conflict for you within your department and within the larger company as a whole. That said, you have a right to get your employee needs met and if your boss and HR team are unwilling to address them, then you have no other recourse than to step up your complaints.

, If, after all of your research and reading, you may simply find that the role of the HR manager is too limited and does not do what you expect of them. If this is the case, it can be a good idea to raise this fact with senior management and request a review of the role and level of input of the HR manager. In doing this, you will need to outline clearly what you and your colleagues think you should be getting from this role.


Making your expectations for HR clear will help guide senior management in its decision of whether or not to review the role and the assistance employees get from the human resources branch.

Listen carefully to the customer.,
Ask thoughtful, concerned questions.,
Apologize sincerely.,
Propose one to two solid solutions for the issue.,
Follow through on the chosen solution.,
Thank the customer for their understanding.",How to Deal With Complaints1," You should always start by listening carefully to what the customer has to say. You should never interrupt the customer or speak over them. Do not get defensive or angry when the customer speaks. Instead, show empathy and concern.Maintain open body language while the customer speaks, such as maintaining eye contact and positioning your body towards the customer. You also smile and nod at the customer to show them that you are listening and paying attention to what they have to say.
Once the customer has finished speaking, you should repeat back what they have said to you. You may say, âThank you for sharing your concern. What Iâm hearing isâ¦â or âI believe you are saying thatâ¦â;
, You should always follow up your acknowledgement of the customerâs issue by asking questions that are thoughtful and show your concern. You should try to get as much information from the customer as you can, as this will allow you to better understand their perspective and work together to find a solution to the issue.For example, if a customer is complaining about poor service by a cashier, you should ask questions like, âWould you mind explaining exactly what happened?â and ask follow up questions like, âWhen did this occur?â or âWhat time did this occur?â

, You should always offer the customer a sincere apology for the issue, no matter the issue. The customer will appreciate the apology, even if they are upset or frustrated and often an apology can help to diffuse the situation.You should try to apologize without blaming anyone, including your employees, the customer, or your companyâs policies. Instead, simply say, âI apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused youâ or âI am sorry that this incident occurred.â

, You should follow up your apology with action. Ask the customer, âWhat would be an acceptable solution to this issue for you?â Or, you can take the initiative and propose one to two solid solutions for the issue. Presenting at least two options will make the customer feel that they have control over the situation and are able to choose a solution that best suits them.For example, if a customer is complaining about a damaged item she purchased, you may propose two solutions. You may propose that she return the item for a full refund or that she replace the item with a non-damaged model, free of charge. You could ask which option she feels more comfortable with so she has options.

, You should always follow through on the solution that is accepted by the customer. This will show the customer that you take their complaint seriously and sincerely wish to make amends for the issue. You should try to follow through on the chosen solution right away so the customer can move on from the issue.


Avoid passing the customer off to a person who is higher on the chain of command, unless the customer requests this option. Moving complaints up the chain of command tends to slow down the process and make the customer more frustrated, especially if there is paperwork or phone calls to higher ups involved.

, Once the customerâs complaint has been addressed and a suitable solution has been found, you should thank the customer for their patience and understanding. You should also give them a contact that they can reach out to, such as your business card or the companyâs customer service line, if they have any other issues or concerns in the future.If the customer complaint is a serious one, you may decide to follow up with the customer a few days after the issue has been addressed. You may ask the customer if they are okay with a follow up call before you initiate it. You should then make the call and confirm that the customer is satisfied with the solution to their issue.

Be a good listener.,
Show empathy and compassion.,
Offer possible solutions and advice.,
Set clear limits and boundaries.",How to Deal With Complaints2," Though it may be difficult to handle complaints from friends and family all the time, you should try to be a good listener and support those close to you. This means not interrupting the person when they are speaking and not talking over them. You should also focus your attention on them when they are speaking and maintain eye contact with them.Try to also practice active listening, where you listen closely to what the person is saying and then repeat what they said to you back to them. You may say, âWhat I hear you saying isâ¦â or âI think you are upset becauseâ¦â Once they have agreed that you have heard what they said correctly, you can respond to them in kind.
For example, maybe your sister is complaining about her boyfriend. Once she has finished speaking, you may say, ""What I hear you saying is that you don't like it when Darren stays out all night without calling you or checking in."" Your sister should agree that you heard her correctly and you can then respond to her complaint.

, Approaching someone who complains with empathy and compassion will allow the person to feel supported and acknowledged. Simply acknowledging the feelings and concerns of the person complaining can really make them feel that they are being heard and that you care.Show empathy for the person by listening to what they have to say and then stating: âI hear what youâre sayingâ, or âI can understand why you might be upset.â
The act of showing empathy can also help the person to reflect on their own perspective and attitude. You may say, âI can see why that might be difficultâ and the person may take a moment to consider if in fact the issue is really that difficult or dramatic. Taking a moment to consider the reality of the situation may allow the person to put their complaints in perspective and not feel as bad about the situation.
Avoid being sarcastic or mocking of the person complaining, even if you feel their complaints may not be justified. Doing this will only make the person feel worse and could lead to a conflict with them. Instead, try to be compassionate and empathetic to the person as much as you can.

, Once you have listened to the personâs complaint, you should try to offer solutions or advice to help them feel better about the situation. You may suggest that they approach the issue in a certain way or share your own experience in a similar situation.However, it's always nice to ask first. Not only does it confirm whether or not the person really wants advice or not, but also helps the person receiving the advice to remain open and receptive to it.
For example, you may say, ""I think you may be missing the positives of the situation"" or ""Have you considered the upsides of the issue?"" You may also make suggestions on how the person can deal with the issue, such as, ""Maybe you could try talking to someone with authority about the issue"" or ""Have you considered letting go of the issue and moving on?""
Keep in mind that though you may offer the person advice or a solution, they may not take it and that is okay. Sometimes, a person is so wrapped up in their situation that they may not be willing or able to take someone elseâs advice. You should try to be supportive of the person, even if they do not take you up on your solution.

, Though you should try to listen and support those around you who have complaints, you should also set firm clear limits for yourself. Setting limits around how long you can listen to the person complain and how often you can be the âvoice of adviceâ for them will ensure you do not take on too much of their situation. You may limit the amount of time you set aside to spend with the person or put boundaries around how long you will listen to the person complain.For example, perhaps you have a family member who often complains about the same issues at her work. You may listen patiently to her talk about the issues for ten minutes at the dinner table and then introduce other topics of conversation. Share whatâs going on in your life or ask the family member about a more positive aspect of her life.
Setting limits will also allow you to be a good listener and support in the future, as listening to too much complaining all the time can lead to resentment and frustration. You should be clear about your boundaries so you do not end up having to always be the one who listens to the personâs complaints.

, When a project has multiple parts, it can seem overwhelming. Break it down into smaller pieces so that you can observe the progress that youâre making., If you plan to volunteer to take on more work, or you are asked to add an extra project, pause for a minute to consider what this will do to your current workload. Calculate how much time you are devoting to various projects and figure out if you have extra time to handle more.If you donât have time to handle more, talk with your supervisor. Offer to take on the new project if another project can be delegated to someone else.

, Understanding what can be realistically accomplished in a given time frame will help you reframe your expectations.

Interpret data in context.,
Leave room for adjustments.",How to Determine a Competitive Wage," Federal wage and hour laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) don't apply to all small businesses, but you must comply with the law if you engage in interstate commerce.Generally, the FLSA applies to any business that has an annual gross volume of business that is at least $500,000, regardless of whether your business is involved in interstate commerce.
You are involved in interstate commerce if your employees order goods from other states or regularly communicate with customers or clients across state lines. Typically you can assume you're subject to the FLSA if you have a website, since you potentially have customers all over the country.
Keep in mind that basically every business is considered to be subject to the FLSA. If you use the telephone or mail service, you're usually covered. If you have any doubts, err on the side of caution and assume your business is covered.
While the FLSA does not require any specific breaks or time off, it does provide minimum wage and overtime standards.;
, Even if you aren't covered by the FLSA, you probably are covered by your state's law, which typically has similar requirements regarding the wages and hours of your employees.Keep in mind that federal law sets the floor, not the ceiling. States are free to set higher requirements for wages and hours, and many do.
For example, if your business is located in California, you must comply with California's wage and hour laws, which go further than the federal laws.
California requires time-and-a-half pay for any hours over eight worked in a day, and requires you pay double-time for any hours over 12 worked in a day.
Employees in California also are entitled to a 30-minute meal break off the clock for every five hours they work.

, You have an obligation to pay your employees at least the minimum wage set in the area where you run your business, which may involve federal, state, or even local law. Competitive wages typically are calculated with reference to the minimum wage.For example, the minimum wage in California is $10 an hour, which is higher than the federal minimum wage. This means hourly wages for a business located in California may be significantly higher than those in a state such as Alabama, which does not have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum wage.
Keep in mind that minimum wage technically applies to your salaried employees as well as your hourly workers. If you're paying someone a salary for a 40-hour workweek, it must equal at least 40 hours at the applicable minimum wage.
While you may want to keep compensation for entry-level positions as close to the minimum as possible, you're unlikely to get valuable, loyal employees in supervisory positions â even if you're paying them salary â if the compensation isn't much over minimum wage.
For example, a salaried employee must be paid at least $290 a week under federal minimum wage laws. A salary of $300 a week for a supervisory position with advanced educational or experience requirements typically would not be considered competitive.

, Your compensation of your employees isn't limited to their base salaries or hourly wages, but also includes the monetary amount that other benefits such as health insurance or retirement plans are worth.Determine the average cost you are paying for the various benefits offered to all employees, and include these cost amounts in your compensation package so potential employees can understand their total compensation.
For example, if you are paying $1200 a year per employee to enable them to have free parking at the parking garage next door to your office, including this cost in your total compensation package allows potential employees to properly evaluate the wages you offer.
Basically, when comparing your wages to those of other companies, they would have to add $1200, which would be the cost they would be paying for parking on their own if you didn't pay it for them.
You can also use these valuations to determine what benefits you should add for your employees. To continue with the parking example, most employees would prefer their employer to take care of parking rather than having to go to the time and effort â not to mention the out-of-pocket expense â of making their own arrangements.
On the other hand, if your business is located in an area with extensive public transportation where most people don't own their own cars, offering to pay for employee parking may be seen as a useless benefit that does nothing to increase the relative base salary or wage.

, To compare the job you're offering to others in the industry, you must determine what aspects of your business an employee in that role will control and where they will fit in the overall hierarchy.Most industries use a specific benchmark job description to set average wages in that industry. You often can find these job descriptions in trade publications or on human resources websites.
You also may want to check job descriptions on the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which maintains information and data about the U.S. job market.

, For each specific job, you must determine what level of education and experience is required to perform that job effectively, as well as any other skills or certification you want in an employee.Be careful not to inflate your minimum qualifications more than absolutely necessary. Keep in mind that the education and experience levels you choose will directly impact the amount of pay necessary to set a competitive wage.
If you're unsure whether you should require a college degree for a particular job, you might consider talking to a professor at a nearby college or university who teaches in a related field.
University job banks also can be good places to check if you want to find out the minimum requirements for employers similar to you that are targeting recent college graduates.
Generally, if you have an entry-level position, you don't want to require experience as a minimum requirement â this will only frustrate entry-level jobseekers.
If you're just starting your business, this is a trade-off. On the one hand, you may benefit by hiring people who already know the job and can step right in and start working from day one.
On the other hand, by hiring people who already have experience you run the risk of having to ""untrain"" habits they may have learned at other companies that don't comport with your practices or overall business philosophy.

, There may be additional skills, degrees, or experience that you don't want to require for a particular position, but that would enable the employee in that position to better perform their duties. Anything you list as a preferred qualification may impact the amount of wages you pay for that position.Preferred qualifications differ from minimum qualifications in that you're perfectly willing to consider candidates for a position without these skills.
Accordingly, the pay rate you set may not necessarily be considered competitive when considering someone who met the minimum and had additional preferred qualifications.
Setting a range at which you advertise the position, rather than a single amount, can capture those applicants who may have preferred skills that you've determined would be advantageous but are not required for an employee in that position.
For example, if you are opening a restaurant and are looking for a closing manager, you may list being a licensed bartender as a preferred qualification. Although you already have bartenders, you've determined it would be helpful if the closing manager had the skills and understanding particular to bar operations.

, Depending on the job market in your industry and geographic area, you may have applicants who are well over-qualified for the open position. If you want to hire someone who is technically over-qualified, this can affect the wages offered for the job.Whether you offer someone a position for which they are technically over-qualified depends on the needs for your business.
If you anticipate that person could rapidly rise to a higher position in your organization, they may be a good fit.
However, keep in mind that you may have to pay a little more to get that person into the lesser position, and this may affect what you offer the next person you hire to replace them after they are promoted.
On the other hand, if your upper-level positions are already set and you don't foresee a vacancy any time in the near future, you may not want to hire someone who is over-qualified. You'll have to pay them more, and they will raise the expected pay rate for that position in your company.
Aside from that issue, you have to worry about the person becoming bored or dissatisfied and quickly moving to another company as soon as they find something better, essentially putting you back at square one.

, Once you've determined exactly what your available positions will entail, it's fairly easy work to find out the average compensation offered for a similarly situated employee in your industry.You can typically use free resources to find the information you need, such as by checking websites, including the BLS, that compile pay scale data for different types of jobs.
However, keep in mind that if your business falls into a relatively narrow niche, you may have difficulty finding data that corresponds directly to the positions you want to fill.
You also can work with an agency that specializes in this area to find the applicable average wages and help you develop a competitive compensation plan. Typically, though, these services are going to cost more than the average small business would need to spend.

, Unless you're planning on hiring nationally from a national pool of applicants, the average national wages in your industry won't necessarily control whether your wage is competitive.For example, if you're hiring for a brick-and-mortar location, such as a retail store or restaurant, a competitive wage would be defined by comparing wages offered at comparable locations nearby.
If you're starting a website or other service where you anticipate national business and the location of your employees is more fluid, you typically would want to look at national statistics. You always have the ability to adjust the pay rate based on the employee's location.
Not only do state minimum wage laws and the prevalence of unions play a role in setting competitive wages in your area, but the cost of living also is a factor.
For example, given the cost of living in San Francisco, you typically would have to offer higher wages there to remain competitive than you would if you were located elsewhere in the bay area.

, Not only is your general industry and your geographic location important, but you also must consider the size of your business, your growth projections, and what you'll need from the employees you plan to hire.If you have a small business that's just starting out, you're going to offer less than a large, established corporation in the same industry â and jobseekers understand that.
To successfully compete with those large corporations, you need to think in terms of value added. Look at the organizational structure and employee mobility to determine what incentives you can offer employees to get and keep them.
While you may not be able to offer an equivalent base salary, look at options you can offer in terms of flex time, the ability to work from home, or other intangible benefits you can provide that would sweeten the pot without breaking the bank.

, Typically the best-qualified applicants will want to negotiate a better compensation package, so once you've determined what you plan to make as an initial offer you should leave room in your budget so you can increase the chances you'll be able to attract the best person for the job.Usually you'll find you get a better response when you advertise a range of compensation rather than a flat dollar amount. Setting a range provides you with more flexibility in the event you find a promising candidate.
You also want to leave room in your budget to reward strong, productive employees with bonuses or other incentives, as well as provide regular pay raises to keep pace with inflation and the cost of living.
Keep in mind that attracting new employees with a competitive compensation package is only one part of the equation. If you want those employees to stay with your company, you want to be able provide pay increases that recognize their contributions to the business.

When youâre inundated with requests for your attention, take steps to eliminate, redirect or postpone some of them.


Close your office door when you need to focus. If someone comes by your desk to chat, tactfully let them know that you have a pressing deadline and you canât chat now.Develop a policy about which emails need to be answered immediately and which can wait.

Sometimes, you'll want to give a thorough and honest answer (""Yes, I've always felt like a boy. By asking you to call me a man, I'm asking you to recognize who I really am), sometimes you'll want to decline a question (""I'd prefer not to talk about my genitals. So, how was your weekend?""), and sometimes you may simply not know.
Write down the names of a few of your favorite articles. You can share them with people who want to learn more.

, This is a difficult decision, and there is no right or wrong way to choose people. Talk at first to a few people whom you believe will be supportive, and gradually come out to everyone in the office.


If you want to get a general sense of who will be accepting, ask them about something similar. For example, ""So, what are your views on this whole same-sex marriage debate?"" This way, you'll get an idea of how accepting they are, without putting yourself in jeopardy.
If you're worried about the conversation, try asking a trusted colleague to be with you during the conversation for moral support.
You may opt to come out to your boss or anyone who is in charge of your employment. They may offer to send a memo to everyone in the office, and handle any rude people.

It's okay to come out to one person at a time. However, be aware that rumors can quickly spread in an office. If you suspect that this might become the case, enlist a few close friends to help monitor and control the situation.

, Once people understand you, they're more likely to accept you. Remember that even though their initial reaction might be of surprise, once they have time to learn about and process this information, they may begin using the correct pronouns and things can return to normal.

, Even though you have done nothing wrong by coming out, you are likely to experience negative consequences for being yourself. Stay strong and put on the best face you can.


If your country has legal protections that guard against harassment and discrimination for transgender employees, use those rights. If you think your coming out has impacted your career path, or you feel harassed or unaccepted at work, consider getting legal help.
If your country has no legal protections, then try to find out support groups in your area to help you out, and even if there are no support groups to help then try to form an alliance with people like you around your area and come out together. Remember united we stand, divided we fall.
Consider another place of work. There are thousands of places where people are understanding and accepting. (Furthermore, you could introduce yourself using your real nameâi.e., not the one you were given at birthâand preferred pronouns. You do not have to tell them that you are transgender.)

, Being transgender is no lesser than being cisgender, and you do not deserve other people's hatred for it. Their mean words say nothing about you and everything about them.


Spend plenty of time on self care. Get lots of sleep, eat well, and do things that make you happy. Find something that relaxes you when you're stressed: warm bubble baths, a quiet place, library books, walks in the woods, lotion, funny cat photos, et cetera. Practice it regularly.

Look at conflict as an opportunity.",How to Deal with Problems at Work1," Donât beat around the bush when you have a problem with your coworker. It is usually easier to address the problem as soon as it comes up, rather than stew over it or get someone else involved.Be informal about it the first time you address the person. You could say, âHey, Jack, Iâve been noticing that youâve been returning the truck almost on empty lately. Could you remember to bring it back with a full tank next time?â
If the behavior continues after you have informally addressed your concern, you may need to ask your supervisor to intervene. Follow your companyâs rules on handling employee conflict resolution.;
, It is important to listen to your coworkers needs respectfully and to try to see their point of view. It is also important to express yourself in a respectful manner. When discussing issues with a coworker, make sure you donât make them feel defensive when you speak to them. You can do this by using âIâ statements. The other person hears your reactions to the situation, not your accusations.Instead of saying, âWe are always waiting on you to get your portion of the work done,â you could use âIâ language and say, âWhen the work isnât in on time, I get really stressed out. I end up needing to work later to get caught up. So itâs really helpful to me if everyone can get the project back on the agreed-upon day.â
You could say, âWhile I appreciate feedback, your comment on my work the other day felt very personal and upset me.â

, You may or may not get along well with your supervisor, but keep the lines of communication open between the two of you as best you can.

(This goes for all of your coworkers, too.) Itâs okay to maintain a professional distance from the person if you donât really care for them.
If you are having a difficult time communicating and getting along with your boss, you may wish to bring your concerns to your HR department or, if you donât have an HR department, talk to your bossâ supervisor.

Try to make some good connections with others, and develop a network of friends who can help you through your work (and life) frustrations.Spend your lunch break with your coworkers and get to know them better away from work.
Spend a few minutes chatting with your coworkers each day.
Invite them to get together after work. You could say, âWould you like to grab dinner after work tomorrow?â This can be a good way to get to know your colleagues better. If you feel comfortable doing so, then you might even invite them to happy hour with you to grab a drink after work.

, If you and a coworker are disagreeing on how a project needs to proceed, refuse to take the disagreement personally. Instead, look at the conflict as an opportunity to learn from the other person.You could say, âKristin, I have to admit that I donât understand your approach. Could you tell me more about why you want to go in this direction?â
Avoid getting personal when giving feedback to a colleague. For example, it would be better to say, âI think we need more detail in this section,â rather than âIf you hadnât waited until the last minute to get this in, you could have given us more information.â

You could consider seeking out a mentor within your company to help you better understand your role.

, Sometimes work problems can develop when you get little or no feedback on your performance. Take the initiative and ask your boss if theyâd be willing to have a conversation with you on how you are doing in your position.


Set a time for you and your boss to talk. Give them a sense of what you want to talk about. For example, you could say, âI was curious to know how you felt about my performance over the last few months. I think Iâve been taking on more responsibilities, and I wanted to get some feedback on what Iâve done well and what needs improvement.â
Donât beat yourself up over a bad performance review. Look at it as a learning opportunity, asking lots of questions so you can best understand how you can make changes. You could say, âI appreciate you bringing these concerns to my attention. Do you have any suggestions as to what I can do to improve my next review?â, Know your companyâs rules and regulations. Know the protocol for addressing a problem in your organization. You may be required to address all problems with your supervisor, or you may need to head to HR for all of your dealings.


Your company may have a chain of command that you are expected to follow in addressing a problem. Make sure you follow the expectations exactly; doing so will make it easier for others to do their jobs as well.
When you meet with someone to address your concerns, bring your copy of the employee handbook with you to reference. You could say, âMr. Kendall, I know I donât usually meet with you, but per the employee handbook, if I am having a problem with my supervisor, Iâm supposed to go to their supervisor. So thatâs why I wanted to talk to you today.â

, If you feel you are being treated unfairly and your problem has not been solved or even addressed, you can take steps to have the problem identified through a more formal procedure. If complaint procedures are not spelled out in your employee handbook, find out through management or HR what steps you need to take.


You could say, âJohn, Iâve taken all of the steps in the employee handbook to follow the chain of command at work, but my concerns are still not being addressed. I want to find out how to file a formal complaint within the company.â
If you feel you are being harassed or discriminated against, for example, it may be beneficial to you to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (if you live in the United States). Find out more at https://www.eeoc.gov/index.cfm.

, If you are represented by a union, know how the union will help you in dealing with any work-related problems. Read a copy of the agreement between your union and your employer, as well as any union materials you may have to find out more information.


You may wish to speak to the union representative at your employer and inform them of your situation. You could say, âIâve been having some problems at work lately, and was wondering if you could let me know if the union will be able to help me in any way.â Explain your situation and ask for support.

Make sure you have good work habits.,
Manage your workload.,
Let your supervisor know if youâre dealing with a personal problem.,
Eat well both at home and on the job.,
Take exercise breaks.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Deal with Problems at Work3," You may be stressed due to a poor ability to stay organized, stay on task, or prioritize assignments. Examine your work habits and find ways to improve before complaining about your workload to your supervisor.If you work on a computer, avoid getting distracted by the internet. You can put extensions on your internet browsers that will limit your access to distracting websites to a predetermined amount of time.
Make sure you are prioritizing tasks in order of importance. If you are not sure what should be done first, ask your supervisor. You could say, âRight now Iâm working on this project. Should I finish it or start this new assignment?â
Delegate responsibility if you are able. If you supervise employees, for example, ask them to help you with parts of the project.

, Feeling overwhelmed with work can be a major source of workplace stress. Know your limits and try not to take on more work than you can handle.You may even feel stressed if you feel like your skills are not equivalent to your responsibilities. In this case, seeking additional training may be a good way to make your workload more manageable. Discuss any concerns with your supervisor.


Alert your supervisor if youâve been given too much work. Let them know you are feeling overwhelmed and ask for suggestions as to how you can prioritize. Are there any projects that can go on the back burner for the time being?You could say, âMike, I appreciate being a valued member of the team, but I am drowning in all this work right now. Iâm working late and not seeing my kids. What can we do to make this workload easier to manage?â
You may need to lower your standards. If the quantity seems more valued than the quality at your workplace, consider spending less time with each assignment you are given.If you are unable to cope with demands of the work, it might be time to look for another job. Sometimes letting your supervisor know you are overwhelmed will not change anything. If thatâs the case, you may want to dust off your resume., If you find stress from your personal life creeping into your work life, be upfront with your supervisor without going into too many details. A good supervisor will likely appreciate know what is going on.Talk to your supervisor in private. Let your supervisor know whatâs up, and what you will need to do to solve the problem. You could say, âI just wanted to let you know that Iâve got some issues I am dealing with at home. I am dealing with it, but there may be a few days when I need to come in late next week.â
Keep in mind that, while you are not obligated to disclose health information, you may need to be a bit more forthcoming if you are dealing with ongoing health problems. For example, you might say, âIâve been told by my doctor that I am going to need surgery. Therefore, there are going to be a few days next month I will be out. Iâll let you know as soon as I can.â

, Avoid going out for fast food over lunch, and pack a healthy lunch instead. Youâll save money as well as improve your health. Putting healthy food in your body will help better regulate your moods and manage stress.Pack a salad in a jar filled with vegetables and protein to get a big serving of veggies and help you avoid the late-afternoon sugar cravings.
Make healthy snack choices if you need a bite to eat. Consider almonds, cheese sticks, or vegetables with hummus.
Avoid foods that send your blood sugar soaring and then crashing, like sugary treats and refined carbohydrates. You will feel even worse.
Coffee and caffeinated beverages are a mainstay of the office, but too much can leave you feeling anxious and stressed. Limit your intake.
Drink plenty of water during your workday.

, Take regular exercise breaks during the day in order to help de-stress. Not only is this good for your physical health, it is good for your mental health as well.If you work a sedentary/desk job, get up from your desk at regular intervals to walk around for a few minutes. It will help you refocus and feel more energized and productive.
Take a walk during your lunch break, or if you can, get a quick workout in.

, Make sure you are getting to bed at a reasonable hour. Sleep deprivation makes emotional regulation more difficult, causing increased irritability and stress.Aim to get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night.
Do something relaxing before bed. Avoid catching up on work email or anything stressful. Try reading for pleasure, taking a bath, or drinking chamomile tea.
Avoid screens an hour before bedtime. The glow from the screen can stimulate wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep.

Basically, dress the part, live the part, surround yourself with other successful people, and openly teach what you've learned to those who seek your knowledge. Be sincere, honest, and maintain integrity. On to Selling.;
, Believe in them yourself, and exude confidence in them through your enthusiastic inflections. Every great sales person knows their products inside and out, and it's a necessity.

, Understand their strengths, understand their weaknesses, and understand the weaknesses they may be exploiting about your solution. NEVER bash your competition, simply express how your products benefits are numerous, well thought out, and differentiate those benefits. This strategy separates you from the competition, and you've taken the high road. You never know if the person you're dealing with purchased from the competition in the past, or has had experiences that may have been great with their products, so don't bash the comp.

, That's right, all the phone calls in the world are great, but who do businesses actually buy from? They buy from people, sales people, and after you put these steps into action, they should be buying from You. I hope you knew that was the answer. These are the leading steps to successful ""pre-sales"". Now onto the real dirty work...

, Numbers count here. There are 2 ways to effectively cold call.


Phone call on possible prospect.
Drop by in person.
A good strategy. When youÂ´re on an appointment, drop collateral for businesses in the area, and most importantly - get your contactÂ´s name after having a friendly and sincere conversation with the gate keeping secretary! There's a tip for you. Now, when youÂ´re cold calling the next morning, you can ask for the person youÂ´re looking to speak with and not get coke-blocked by the secretary / gatekeeper / assistant / whoever might be paid to hide the contact you need from those other sales people that do nothing more than pester the poor buyer.

, Be brief, and do NOT read a script! In cold calling over the phone, you have one goal: get a face to face meeting. That's it. Simple. How? You introduce yourself, and politely ask if they ""would have an hour to share over the next few days so that I might be able to gain a better understanding of your business and initiatives, as well as to best convey the capabilities of our organization, Mozilla Technologies, Inc. Would early afternoon on Tuesday accommodate your schedule?"" Guaranteed: you'll have a brief conversation, and they will question you vigorously on your products on the phone. Do not obviously divert their question, rather, use this as an opportunity to entice them into the meeting.


Prospect ""What is it your company does exactly?""
You-""We offer a wide array of solutions for businesses, and depending on your initiatives, I would expect you'd find an exceptional amount of value in our offerings. Much like XYZ did in using our -blah blah product - for their initiative. It's saved them 10% in overall ops cost and produced a drastic process improvement measure. A time savings to the tune of 90 minutes a day per employee! That's exactly why I'd like take the opportunity to introduce our company to you sir. I believe you'll find tremendous benefit from the hours worth of time on Tuesday afternoon...""
Silent pause and wait for their response. Odds are - you'll get something to this effect - ""Well Tuesday is booked and actually I'm booked solid for a few weeks. Could you send me something?"" - but you were smart about it because you had already dropped off collateral from your previous campus cold calling!
You - ""actually, I had dropped off some information for you, but with out a better understanding your company, it may not even be pertinent to you, and I certainly don't want to waste your time. I would be happy to put something on the calendar for later next week if you like?"" From here, you've gave it you all, and your odds are a solid 70% for a meeting. That is all you needed to do. Save the selling for the meeting, and hit the next number on your prospect list.

, Way to go! The cold calling paid off. What do you do for the first meeting? You be a boy scout. Be Prepared. Research the company, research your prospect, and come in informed prior to the meeting. Once introduced and you're settling in to talk in an office / conference room you build rapport. Ask about tenure, family, hobbies, and be pleasant. Upon getting the meeting rolling, address the clock. Ask if the time-frame you had requested is still good with the client, and be aware of the clock throughout the meeting.

, You're now in front of your target audience for the first time. Set the agenda by having the future client describe their position, the company, their initiatives, and what it is that keeps them up at night. As you pose these questions, listen, and continue to build rapport. The worst sales people, contrary to the popular misconception, are those that talk too damn much. Keep the prospect engaged and ask the ever so clever open-ended questions. For those of you who have not been introduced to sales, ever, an open-ended question is one which cannot be answered with a simple yes or no answer. Build more rapport and present your solution as it corresponds to their pain points. How to uncover those pain points and interject your solution could be a book in itself, but I will leave you with a clue. Create a vision in the future client's mind. A vision with your solution tackling their problems, and making them look good in the process. Ultimately, any good sales person is one who is happy to position themselves quietly behind their client, allowing their client to take the credit for ""finding"" or ""implementing"" the solution. Once this has been done, your set for easier, future successes with a grade A account!

, Sales cycles differ with clients, with products, and with budgets. So keep prospecting, cold calling, and running appointments. Sales is a numbers game, but focus on the accounts that bring you those numbers. - I grade my accounts A through D - An A being a top client with ample budget for me to consume throughout the year, and B's being a client that needs to move towards an A account. D's and C's are prospects, and classified by budget, size, potential, and relationship status. Check out the additional tips and warnings below!

, There are 2 trains of thought - work on your weakness, or build on your strengths. Happy selling.

Learn about hospital regulations and standards.,
Read about national medical regulation agencies.,
Obtain vendor qualifications.",How to Sell to Hospitals1," For a vendor, the products and services offered need to be good enough to fit the hospital's mandatory standards for purchase. Read up on medical regulations in your state or area and make sure that your wares comply.


Standards for hospitals are usually determined regionally or by state. Different states may have different regulations, so itâs important to know the standards for the state youâre selling in.
Your goods or services also need to be of high quality and recognized by medical organizations, especially if you are selling medical equipment. For the most part, these medical organizations will be affiliated with the federal government or licensed by it.;
, For example, in the United States, the Joint Committee for Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCAHO) plays a big part in how hospitals run their business and, potentially, from whom they will buy. They often give accreditation to hospitals and verify hospital purchasing choices meet their standards.You can find manuals on the standards for different units, wards, and types of hospitals on their website. These manuals may help you when determining the correct standards for medical equipment or other goods and services.Additionally, JCAHO offers best practices for hospitals on their website. While these may not illustrate standards for goods and services, it can tell you a lot about the potential needs of different hospitals.

, It is recommended to be able to prove compliance with regulations or other quality control for goods and services. This can take the form of certification for applicable items as well as less formal qualifications.


You will likely have to fill out a qualification form available at each individual hospital or on their website. These forms take a variety of shapes, but will likely detail the regulations your goods and services meet as well as any potential conflicts of interest.Additionally vendor qualification forms may include a statement of hospital-specific standards vendors are expected to meet. This may include product regulations as well as product standards required from vendors.

Evaluate hospital needs.,
Find out the hospitalâs specialty.,
Research the population of the hospital.,
Learn about the background of the hospital administration.",How to Sell to Hospitals2," Before ramping up a sales initiative toward a hospital or similar facility, it's often possible to do an evaluation of just what the client may need. This can be done with any kind of observational information, even just based on a walkthrough of the facility or talking to staff on an informal basis.


In your walkthrough, you may also notice out-of-date or older equipment. If you are selling equipment, then it may be useful to focus on updating the hospitalâs technology to be the most cutting-edge possible.
Depending on the region, you may have to set up a formal appointment to talk to hospital staff. Itâs important to not violate any regulations, especially before you try to sell to a hospital.

, Hospitals have a variety of different specialties that they may be known for. While some hospitals are focused towards treating certain clientele, such as children, others are focused on particular diseases, such as cancer or heart disease.


Childrenâs hospitals usually focus exclusively on treating children. Since many of these hospitals may be funded by donations, their needs will be different from hospitals that are not based on donations for funding.Hospitals may focus on particular diseases; at the very least, they may be known for the treatment of those diseases. When selling to these hospitals, it may be important to know that these specific diseases are important to the hospitalâs goal and reputation., Depending on where the hospital is located, they may treat different populations that have different ailments. You should know whether the hospital is rural, suburban, or urban, as well as the demographics of those treated at your hospital.


Rural and urban hospitals may suffer from outdated equipment and scant resources. If you can offer these hospitals ways to save money, this may be a good place for you to sell your goods and services.University hospitals are often research-oriented. While the amount of money in the hospital often depends upon the university that the hospital is affiliated with, the populations the hospitals serve may differ depending on the university and its location.The ethnic, financial, and cultural makeup of those treated at the hospital may also dictate their needs. In lower income areas, hospitals may treat very different conditions than in more well-off areas.

, The hospital administration may dictate the direction of the hospital. Itâs important to look at their credentials and academic background so you know what types of things are important to them.Hospital administrators are usually medical doctors, though they may have experience in the private sector. If they are a medical doctor, itâs good to know their specialty, since this may be a focus for their administration.
If the hospital administrator is from the private sector, then itâs important to know what other companies they have worked at. It may tell you their financial values, as well as what they find important about hospital administration.

Talk to the right people.,
Reach out to senior administration.,
Understand sales to hospital administrators.,
Give out your contact information.",How to Sell to Hospitals3," Youâll need to know how to reach staff at all levels of the hospital operation. This will help you to connect and fill needs for that facility.Calling the hospital administrator directly may not be the best idea. Once youâre on the approved vendors list, youâll want to set up an appointment to talk to the administration in a more formal manner.
You may also want to talk to prominent doctors in the hospital, especially if itâs a hospital with a specific medical focus. In particular, find the head of different departments to ask them about their needs within the hospital.

, Senior hospital administrators will have a lot to say about purchasing. You should listen to them about their needs before starting your own sales pitch.


If you get an appointment with administration, listen to what they have to say about their needs first. By listening actively, youâll show that youâre interested in working together in a mutually beneficial way.Before pitching your own products, state back to them what you understand as their needs. This will make it clear youâre on the same page before you try to sell your own goods and services.

, The best practices in selling to hospital administrators will vary, depending on the type, location, and administrative structure of the hospital. However, some general sales practices may always be useful when selling to hospitals.


Try to avoid speaking from a set âscriptâ when selling to hospitals. Hospital administrators want to be heard and a script makes it seems like you were not listening.Itâs not always important that you make an immediate sale with a hospital administrator. Sometimes, itâs good to build a long-term relationship with them so they will talk to you when making future purchasing decisions.

, Hospital administrators should know how to contact you in the future. Additionally, it may be a good idea to talk to prominent doctors and heads of departments so they know how to get ahold of you when making future purchasing decisions.


Administrators may be more comfortable talking in person, on the phone or via e-mail. Itâs important that they can get ahold of you when they need something; otherwise, they may go to another vendor.
Itâs also a good idea to make yourself visible to the administrator and senior staff. If they purchase something from you, keep up to date with the status to guarantee they are satisfied. This will help to guarantee more sales in the future.

Create resting spots for your eyes.,
Add a zen garden to your workspace.,
Organize your desk.,
Create an ergonomic space.,
Consider alternate seating.,
Enjoy a soothing scent.,
Let there be light.",How to De Stress at Work1," You can add some flavor to your work space without making it look too cluttered. Just put up a few photos of your favorite people or places, a lovely piece of art, or a card that makes you smile. Adding a plant or bouquet of flowers to your desk can also make your space more visually appealing. Every fifteen minutes or so, take a break from your computer and rest your eyes on these favorite items.;
, A zen garden can help you feel calmer and less overwhelmed. Take a five-minute break every hour or so to rake your zen garden, and feel soothed by the sound of the rake pushing through the sand. Rearranging the garden a bit can also make you feel more calm and in control. The zen garden would also create another perfect resting spot for your eyes., You will feel less stressed at work if your desk is more organized. Make sure your desk isn't cluttered with anything beyond the essential items you use often, like a cup of pencils, notepad, and your phone, as well as the few visually-appealing items you've chosen for resting your eyes. File everything away neatly, and throw out any pens that no longer work. The more manageable your workspace feels, the more in control of your work and life you will feel.


Take at least five to ten minutes at the end of every workday to organize your space. This will guarantee that the order you've set up will be maintained.

, If your space is more ergonomically organized, your body will be less tense and your mind will follow. If your hands are aching from so much typing, you should consider getting a split keyboard or a sideways mouse to ease the pressure on your wrists and fingers. Keep the things you use often within reach so you don't have to strain to find and use them.


Adjust your seat so you are facing your monitor and aren't straining your neck by looking too far above or below you.

, If you don't have a swivel chair, you can consider getting one to keep your body active and engaged while you type. Swiveling around in the chair will make your time at work feel more fun and less monotonous. Though studies haven't concluded that a stability ball can improve your posture, sitting on this ball can just make work feel more fun and give you more freedom to move around.If sitting in a chair for many hours a day is causing you a lot of pain, you can consider getting a standing desk. This will improve your posture and can make you feel more calm at work.

, Light some sage (if your office allows it) or leave a bouquet of lavender on your desk and let the natural smells make you feel calmer and more at peace. Even adding some nice potpourri to your work space can make the environment feel more your own and can relax your mind and body., Make sure your work space is filled with soothing, soft light. You should have enough light to see clearly and to feel alert, but too much light, especially fluorescent lighting, can make you feel more anxious and worried. A desk lamp with a soft bulb covered by an opaque lid can mimic the soothing effects of a real candle.


If you have a window in your workspace, try to be as close to the light from the window as possible. Your back should be positioned toward the window so the natural light can fall in front of you.

Write down your problems at work.,
Create new goals.,
Develop a plan of action.,
Start looking for a new job.",How to Deal with a Toxic Job1," If you know what your problems are at work, you can deal with them more effectively. Keep a journal for a week or two. Every time you have a problem at work, write it down.Some examples might include:


âIâm being asked to work too many hours, and now I feel burned out.â
âMy boss keeps asking me to take on more projects, and I canât say no.â
âMy coworkers are gossiping behind my back.â
âI canât rely on my team to get their work done, so I end up doing it all.â
âI feel as though I am being unfairly criticized for my work.â;
, Sometimes it might seem as though you have no control at work or that you have no opportunities to escape your current position. You can regain control by identifying new goals for yourself. These can be career goals or general life goals. You might want to establish both long-term goals for where you want to be after five years as well as some shorter-term goals to complete within the next year. Some goals might include:


âI want to get a promotion to a higher position within two years.â
âI want to be able to spend more time with my family in the evenings.â
âI want to be able to find a job that offers better benefits.â
""I want to run my own business.""
""I want to get my MBA in three years.""
""I want to win the customer service award.""
""I want to feel less stressed in my daily life.""

, Now you can begin to start identifying practical solutions to help you reach your new goals. Try to come up with a few manageable steps that will help you escape the rut of your job. These may be steps that help you find a new job or they might help relieve the tension at your current job.You can learn a new skill, such as coding or a different language. You can teach yourself, go to a local community college, or take advantage of a work-training program.
You can request a transfer to another team. Make sure you have spoken to members of the other team before you do so to make sure that they are a better fit for you.
You may be able to request working at home once or twice a week to escape the negative atmosphere at your job.

, You cannot always fix a bad job. If your job is taking a toll on your health and mental wellbeing, you should start looking for a new job immediately. You do not necessarily have to quit your old job while you search for new positions. By keeping an eye on the job market, you may be able to land a new job with a healthy workplace.You should update your resume to reflect your most recent experience. You should also update any networking sites that you use, like LinkedIn.
Check local job boards to see which companies are currently hiring. You can also contact businesses in your field to see if they would be interested in looking at your resume.
Remember that you may have to ask your boss for a reference.Do not start neglecting your current job just because you are planning to quit.

Picture your favorite vacation.,
Make friends with your coworkers.,
Get some perspective.,
Meditate.,
Write things down.,
Read a book.,
Manage your workload.,
Make work more fun.,
Go to lunch.,
Play calming music.",How to De Stress at Work2," When things are getting too tense at work, just close your eyes for a minute or two and remember your favorite vacation spot. Try to recreate the smells, the sounds, and the tastes that made the place so special to you. Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed, just return to that place. Having a memento from your favorite spot on your desk can also make it easier for you to remember it.And if you can find it in your budget to return to your favorite spot from time to time, you will be living a more relaxed life during and after work.

, Maybe you feel stressed at work because you feel like you're in your own little bubble and have no one to talk to during the day. Though you don't have to become best friends with your coworkers, just getting to know them over a quick lunch or a break in the coffee room can help you feel like you have people who are in the same boat and can understand your struggles.


Being friendly and smiling more will not only help you make friends, but it will help your body naturally feel more calm.
Getting to know your coworkers will also make you more likely to laugh, which is another stress-relieving activity.
If you get close to one of your coworkers, you can open up a bit about how stressed you're feeling, and you'll feel less alone when talking about your feelings.

, When you're feeling so impossibly overwhelmed -- like you'll never get all of your work done, like you're about to get fired, or like nothing you do can ever be enough, sit back, take a deep breath, and tell yourself to get some perspective. Though work can feel all-consuming, at the end of the day, a job is a job, not a life-and-death matter -- unless you have a job where lives are at stake, of course.


Remind yourself of all of the other things that make you happy and relaxed, from your friends and family to your favorite hobbies or pets.
Though ""It's not the end of the world"" is an overused phrase, telling yourself that you may be overreacting to stressful situations at work can help you remember your priorities.

, Meditating right at your desk or on the floor for just twenty minutes a day can help you feel more relaxed and in control of your days. To mediate, just find a comfortable seat in a quiet place and rest your hands on your lap, straighten your posture, and focus on relaxing your body one part at a time.


Close your eyes and take in all of the sounds and sensations as you breathe in and out.
You can also meditate right before work to make for a less stressful day in the workplace.

, Though you may be married to your computer, you should take breaks to write down a few things, from your daily to-do list to some information you received over the phone. Writing down some words -- even if they aren't essential to your job -- can give your mind a break from the computer screen and can refocus your energies and make you feel less overwhelmed.

, Studies show that reading for just six minutes a day can help calm your mind and reduce your levels of stress. Though you most likely won't be able to read an entire novel during a day at work, taking breaks to read just ten or so pages a day can help calm your mind and make you feel more ready to approach your daily tasks.


You can even start a book club with your coworkers to make work more enjoyable and to motivate yourself to read more.

, Another way to soothe your mind in the workplace is to make sure that you aren't overwhelmed by all the work that you have to do. You can try to manage your workload by delegating some of your tasks to others, asking for more help on projects, or even by cutting back on some of the work you said you'd take on.


You may be feeling stressed because you're not as productive as you could be during the first few hours of work and have to rush to get everything done by quitting time -- to avoid this, create a daily schedule that ensures that you'll get everything done before it's time to leave.

, If you make your work experience more enjoyable, you'll be more excited to come in to work, to spend the day there, and to return the next day. Though you may feel it's impossible to make your job fun, you can make your work more enjoyable by bringing in treats for your coworkers, treating yourself to a nice lunch once a week, or just by rewarding yourself with a juicy romance novel or delicious cookie for getting some work done.


If your thoughts about your workplace are more positive, you'll be much more excited to be there and won't look at work as purely a place of stress.

, Though you may feel that going to lunch will only waste your time and keep you from accomplishing necessary tasks, you'll actually feel happier and less stressed if you go to lunch, as well as more focused and productive. Lunch provides the perfect mid-day break to help you get a rest from all of your hard work and to gear up for working until the evening.


Even if you're by yourself, you shouldn't bring your food to your desk, or you won't feel like you're taking a break at all when you eat. Even if you just sit outside for twenty minutes to enjoy a salad, your mind will be relaxing.

, Create a mix of the songs that make you feel the most at peace, whether it's your favorite Enya CD or the music of Mozart or Beethoven. Play these songs on your headphones or quietly at your desk if you don't disturb anyone. This can make you feel more at peace, and less overwhelmed by all of the tasks ahead."

Do yoga.",How to De Stress at Work3," To feel less stressed, you need to get up out of your seat at least once an hour. Taking a short walk for just ten to twenty minutes just once during your work day can help put your body at ease. Make a goal of taking the stairs instead of the elevator and of walking to a coworker's desk instead of asking him something over email. Any simple movement will make you feel more loose and and less overworked.Even doing twenty jumping-jacks near your desk can make you feel invigorated and more alert.

, Stretching your body from time to time can help release your tension and can make you feel much more calm and in control. You can stretch your arms, neck, shoulders, and your back right at or in front of your desk by making just a few easy movements. Here are some things to try:


Just stand up and touch your toes. Hold this position for ten seconds. This will create a great stretch for your back.
Roll your shoulders backward and forward. This will release the tension in your back and neck.
Stretch your neck by moving your head to the left and right, as if you were going to press your ear to your shoulder.
Stretch your forearms and wrists by moving one hand straight out in front of you with your palm up, like you were saying ""Stop!"" and then bending back your fingers towards you.
Stretch your upper and lower back by holding one side of your chair with both of your arms and twisting in that same direction.

, There are certain foods that can help you feel more centered and less agitated and stressed out. Some studies show that eating an orange or even just sucking on an orange slice can make you feel more at peace.Some other foods that are known to relieve stress are avocado, salmon, almonds, and spinach, so try to add these foods to your lunch routine or to snack on them periodically., The caffeine in coffee, soda, and especially energy drinks can make you feel more jittery and stressed out. Though caffeine may make you feel more focused, alert, and productive for a while, you'll feel anxious and shaky when you come down from a caffeine high. If you drink a serious amount of caffeine, try to slowly wean yourself off of it instead of quitting cold turkey.


There is also caffeine in tea, but drinking caffeinated tea in small doses is more soothing than sipping coffee. Drinking from a non-caffeinated tea like a peppermint tea can make you feel more relaxed., Yoga is touted for its ability to soothe your mind and body. Going to a yoga class before or after work can make your workplace experience more enjoyable, and taking a lunch-break to take a short yoga class can also help you feel more centered and in touch with your mind and body. Find a friend from work to be your yoga body, and enjoy the benefits you'll feel -- both for your mind and your body.

Maintain your boundaries.,
Distance yourself from problematic coworkers.,
Avoid gossip.,
Praise others for their accomplishments.",How to Deal with a Toxic Job2," In a toxic workplace, it is easy to become the person who does everything. You may feel as though you have to take complete responsibility for a task so that it gets done, or you may feel pressured to always say yes to your boss and coworkers when they ask you to do something. Put your foot down, and assert your boundaries.



Learn to say âno.â Do not agree to do something unless you are willing and able to take it on. You can say, âI know you want to take next week off, but I canât cover for you during that time. I have my own work to complete. Sorry, but maybe you can find someone else.â
You may also want to establish when you are and are not available for work calls. You should make it clear to your coworkers and boss when you can be called during non-work hours., If there a particular coworker who causes problems, you should try to avoid them as much as possible. Only interact with them when you have to do, and keep it strictly professional. You do not have eat lunch with them, carpool, or chat together if you do not want to., It can be tempting to vent about your boss or colleagues to your coworkers, but this is generally a bad idea. Not only does it contribute to the toxic atmosphere of the workplace, but it can also get you in trouble, especially if the other person decides to complain. Do not risk your job. Avoid talking about coworkers behind their backs., A great way to inject some positivity into your workplace is to compliment others when they have done well. This can help ease the tension, and the happiness may spread throughout the workplace. Aim for at least compliment or positive reinforcement a day.For example, if a coworker has responded quickly to a request, you can say, âThanks for getting back to me so quickly. I knew I could rely on you.â
You should also compliment your boss in a productive way. You can say, âThanks, Joe. I know it is a stressful time of year, but your efforts really help us all stay productive.â

"
"
Document everything.,
State the problem and the solution.,
Avoid blaming people.",How to Deal with a Toxic Job3," Any proof you have of the problem will help demonstrate to your boss that it is real. Furthermore, you should have evidence that you tried solving the problem before going to your boss. Emails, memos, and other notes to coworkers, colleagues, and managers are all good forms of written evidence.For example, you might send an email like, âDear Louise, I was wondering if you could send me those reports by Wednesday. We need to get back to the client by Friday regarding this issue.â If Louise does not respond by Tuesday, send another email. If the reports are late, you have evidence that you requested them ahead of time.
If you had a meeting, you should send a follow-up email. This is a good way to document spoken communications. This might say, âHi everyone, Thanks for meeting today. We had a really productive session, and I hope we can all move forward now. We all agreed that we would communicate more about our project status, which I think will improve our efficiency. Thanks again.â
These emails should always be professional. Do not blame people or use hurtful language.

, You should approach your boss with a solution-oriented mindset. Have a few potential ideas in mind. This will make it seem like less like a complaint, and your boss may be more likely to follow-up on your request.


Instead of saying, âNobody ever tells me what Iâm supposed to do,â you might say, âI find the lack of oversight in our project guidelines to be inefficient. It causes us to spend too much time trying to figure out what weâre supposed to do. What if we tried creating a universal template for these guidelines, where it is clearly stated what is expected for each project?â

, Blaming, insulting, or accusing other coworkers may backfire against you. Your boss may think you are being hostile, and they may not be willing to solve the problem. Instead, they may tell you to deal with the coworker yourself.


Instead of blaming coworkers, phrase their problems as a larger issue. For example, instead of saying, âWalterâs calculations are full of mistakes,â you might say, âThere seems to be many errors in the accounts, and it takes us twice as long to fix these errors as it would to do them properly in the first place.â
âIâ statements are a good way to avoid blame. Avoid using âyouâ phrases such as âyou should be doing betterâ or âyou need to fix this now.â These might offend your boss. Instead, try saying, ""I feel as though our morning meetings are too long, and I feel as though they take away from our productivity."""

Vent to a trusted friend.,
Exercise.,
Find a new hobby.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Deal with a Toxic Job5," It can be therapeutic to talk about your problems with a confidante.

It can also increase your energy and boost your self-esteem. While you may not be able to solve all of your problems, you can improve your physical health. Many people find that exercising helps them deal more efficiently with their stress and problems at work.You might consider:

A creative outlet can also help you process your emotions and improve your overall happiness.If you do not have a hobby, you might consider:


Gardening
Volunteering at an animal shelter
Learning to paint
Knitting
Woodworking
Photography

, You should aim for at least eight hours of sleep a night, and try to avoid getting less than six.Sleep is important to maintain your energy, mood, and health.

Even an hour more of sleep a night can help you manage your workplace problems with more vigor and positivity."

Determine if there are counseling services available.,
Be available for the family.,
Reach out to the family.,
Share your feelings.,
Organize a way to honor the deceased person.,
Know that not everyone deals with grief the same way.,
Find a support group.",How to Cope with Workplace Grief1," If a fatal accident happens at work or a co-worker dies, many companies will offer counseling services through them to help deal with the grief. This counseling will be aimed at helping you cope and grieve for your co-worker so you can move on and continue to work despite the loss.Talk to your manager, supervisor, or HR representative to see if there are services available to you.;
, If someone in your workplace has died, they may want contact with people their loved one worked with. They may want help cleaning out desks or lockers, or they may want to share any memories you have of your co-worker.If you are in a management position, you may also need to answer questions or provide help for the family of your colleague, especially with dealing with any workplace paperwork or business.

, Some people cope with grief by extending their condolences and support to the family of the deceased. You may decide you would like to contact the family and support them. If you are not sure how to get in touch with them, talk to someone in management to determine if they can let the family know you would like to contact them to offer support.For example, you may want to attend funeral services, bring food, help clean out desks or lockers, or send flowers.

, If you feel it will help, share your feelings with others. This may be a co-worker who wants to talk about the deceased person. If there is no one at your workplace you want to talk to, talk to a family member or friend.For example, you may say, âI would like to talk about our co-worker. I have a lot of feelings and am trying to cope. I think talking about it will help.â

, When someone in your company dies, you may want to remember them by doing something in their honor. This can help give closure to the people who worked alongside of them. Honoring the deceased coworker can also help everyone cope.For example, you may make a board or wall in memorial of the person with photos, memories, and notes.
You may want to donate money in their name to a charity or hold a fundraiser in their honor and donate the proceeds to charity.
Hold a company memorial service for the person where colleagues can get together to share memories and grieve together.

, When you experience a death at your office, everyone will not react the same. Some people talk about their grief or deal with it outwardly. Others will ignore it or refuse to talk about it. Some people cannot handle other peopleâs grief because they have enough trouble dealing with their own. Donât be angry when a co-worker doesnât grieve the same way you do.Respect how your co-workers grieve. If you want to talk about it and your co-worker doesnât, donât badger them. If they want to talk and you donât, gently say, âI understand you want to discuss this. However, I am not comfortable talking about it. Please respect the way I grieve and know I wish not to talk about it.â

, When your co-workers are all faced with tragedy, it can be helpful to create a support group. Find others who want to talk about their grief or just be around others who understand. You can hold weekly meetings to talk through the grief while you all heal.Donât be offended if someone doesnât want to join the group. Not everyone will be comfortable sharing their grief with co-workers.
If you canât get a support group together at work, consider looking for a support group in your area dealing with loss or trauma.

Be the biggest fan of your product.,
Be real and honest.,
Expect a positive response.,
Make excuses for your prospects.,
Accept rejection as a part of selling.,
Convert your pains of rejection into improvement.",How to Sell With Boldness,"


Donât bother selling a product you canât vouch for. The reason is simple: nobody will buy. You may not be the original producer or know everything about the product. But you must have understood the benefits of the product by use and be able to share your pleasant experiences with the prospect. Every potential buyer, client or investor is extra-sensitive when it comes to parting with money.
What they want to see is a salesperson or businessman who is sincere and can defend his or her claims on what the product is capable of offering. The best way to win a sale is to speak with confidence and conviction.;
,


Prospects recognise sincerity in boldness when they it. Donât try to mention a benefit that your product or service is not capable of offering the prospect. If your product has a limitation, admit it. List out the possible questions a prospect might want to ask about your product and prepare an appropriate response in advance.

,


Visualize your prospect as a pleasant and reliable person. How do you approach a colleague you know is very pleasant and likeable? Your answer should determine the way you should approach every prospect. Good emotions are contagious and people are more than willing to return kind gestures if you offer it to them first. A genuine and friendly smile would win any sane person anytime, any day.

,


Not all prospects you meet would be interested in your product. Not even all those that are interested would be willing to buy immediately. But if you have created a great first impression, then you can be sure that they will call you, recommend you or come back to request for that product or service.
Except for window shoppers many people want to take their time before buying a product especially when it is a substantial item like a car, house, large investment, insurance policy and so on. If a prospect doesnât buy your product or service, just assume that it is because of lack of sufficient funds, or that she needs some time to think through the offer.
Donât always think it is because of your inability to sell effectively; even the very best sales or business people get turned down sometimes. When you meet someone who is not ready to buy immediately, be nice, then drop your contacts before you move on. Who knows, she may turn up a few days later to discuss the offer.

,


Understand that every âNOâ could become a âMAYBEâ and every âMAYBEâ could become a âYESâ. A âNoâ may mean âI need more information on your product/serviceâ or âshow me more benefits of your productâ. Understand that the most rejected people in the world are the most successful salesmen. HOW?

,


While it is good to risk rejections often by approaching more customers, make sure you learn from your mistakes and improve your capacity to win more sales with less attempts.
One small negative attitude may be hindering your enormous potentials in selling. Study your selling process. If your choice of words is not working, change them. Adjust, modify, adapt and improve until your performance begins to increase.

Make your prospect feel like you care.,
Use questions to identify the customer's problems.,

Get to the root of the issue.,
Locate problems with their current service provider or product.,
Make your prospects aware of the consequences of their action or inaction.,
Use trigger questions.,

Narrow your questions over time.,
Let the customer talk.,
Inquire about their overall goals.,
Ask about the future.,
Find out if they have any questions.",How to Sell More Effectively by Asking the Right Questions," Many people long simply to be heard and understood. By focusing on your prospects and their problems through questions, you will show that you genuinely care about hearing their problems. And you should genuinely care, because you want to find out as much information as you can about their problems, especially how they perceive their problems.


If you are just meeting your potential customer, try asking questions to get to know them as well. Try to draw out information about their family or hobbies that you can use when you see them again.
If you already know the customer, ask questions related to what you know about them. For example:

Got any weekend plans?
I hear you're retiring soon. What are you thinking of doing then?;
, Too many salespeople assume that they fully understand their prospects' problems. You need to ask questions at the right time about the right things in order to get the information you need to make the sale, or else you might lose credibility and lose the sale forever. Make sure that your customer knows that your focus is on them.


When they specify a problem, try asking for a specific example of a situation in which this problem arose. Ask for specifics and sympathize with their challenges.
For example, try phrasing your question like, ""What are your problems with regards to...?"", Question the custom directly to ascertain how much they estimate the problem that they identified has cost them, is costing them, or will cost them. If they cannot identify a cost or ballpark one, it is likely the problem doesn't need solving and you should seek a sale elsewhere. However, just by asking you may force them to consider the cost and, by doing so, create a need to solve the problem. Try asking, ""Can you give me an estimate of what this issue has cost over the past year in lost sales?"" or something similar., Your customer, even with the best of intentions, may not be communicating his or her real problem. The challenge that they talk about may just be a side problem or a result of their real problem. In fact, they may not even know the real problem directly. It is your job as a salesman to bring this root problem into the daylight and come to the rescue with your solution. Use your own business knowledge and targeted questioning to reveal more about the customer's operation until the root problem becomes clear to you.For example, a customer may claim that their marketing is not working when, in reality, their product quality has declined and customers no longer want to buy it. The marketing problem is just a symptom of a deeper issue.

, In many cases, the customer will already have one of whatever you are selling. It is then your duty to identify what they don't like about their current product or service and suggest your own as an alternative. If you're selling cellphones, for example, your customer probably already has a cell phone, but you may be able to convince them that your cell phone that you are selling has more features or is faster.


Try drawing out issues that they have with their current service or product. Try saying something like, ""Why isn't (the service) working out for you?"" or ""Why did you choose to meet with me today? Are you looking to make a change?""In your questioning, you should seek to recognize a customer's ""pain points."" These are problems that the customer has, whether they are real problems or just perceived ones. By identifying and solving these pain points, you bring value to your customer and are able to make a sale., At the end of the day, you will not be able to push your prospects into the sale. Countless salespeople think that their product is the answer to their prospect's problem, and they push and push and push to show their prospect that they have the answer. But people resist, especially when you push too hard. That's why you must not only use questions not only to find out about your prospects' problems, but also to make your prospect aware of the consequences of their actions or, more powerfully, their inaction. Make them consider what could happen to them if they don't buy your product.


Making people realize what could happen if they don't act drives action by turning the want for a change to a need for one. Build up the significance and seriousness of the problem in your favor.For example, try asking:

If you don't solve this problem, what difficulties will you face in the future?
Are you still able to meet your goals if you don't fix this issue?, Just like a psychiatrist, your job is to get your prospect to open up and tell you what is on their mind. To do this, you must ask open-ended questions, that is, questions that require them to respond with a relatively complex answer rather than a simple yes or no. Remember, you want to get them talking. Closed questions, which allow your prospect to answer you with a yes or a no, don't get them to open up. Open-ended questions do. There are many types of effective question formats, but when in doubt, rely on the open-ended questions called trigger questions.


Here are some examples of basic Trigger Questions:

Can you tell me more about it?
Can you be more specific?
Can you give me an example?


More specific trigger questions might be:

What, specifically, is holding you back from your growth goals?
Why did you agree to meet today?
What is wrong with your current provider?"", Another type of question allows you to test the waters and determine what your prospect is thinking is the floater question. Floater questions enable you to ask hypothetical what-if questions that may help you to ask what might otherwise be uncomfortable questions to your prospects.


Here are some examples of floater questions that the top salespeople use:

Let's say ____, then what happens next?
Let's pretend ________ then would you?
If I could get my colleagues to ..., do you think you could get your colleagues to?
What would you say if?
What would you do if?
Would you buy today if?


Again, what you are doing is feeling your prospect out by putting them in a hypothetical situation. They will give you at least some idea of how much they are willing to spend, or what is important in the negotiation for them, or how close to buying they are., Adjust your own use of technical vocabulary to the person you are speaking to. For example, speak with authority to an industry veteran by peppering in technical jargon from his field as you ask your questions. Of course, the jargon must be used correctly and in the right places. In contrast, when speaking to a novice or a retail customer, you should make your questions as easy to understand and straightforward as possible., Start with a broad field of discussion and then slowly work your way down to specific problems and your ability to solve them. This approach eases your customer's mind because they are able to easily answer the first questions. For example, try starting with something like, ""Can you tell me a bit about your business?"" From here, work your way to narrower and narrower focuses until you reach the question most relevant to your proposed solution, such as, ""What is the impact of inventory shrinkage on your profit margin?"", The reason questions are a successful sales tactic is that they allow the customer to do most of the talking. This gives you a better idea of what their needs are and how you can sell your product to them. But this only works if you actually give your customer time to talk. In other words, don't drown them in product description and technical information. Instead, save this information for later, when you've identified the problem and already sold them on the fact that you can provide a solution. After all, if they just wanted information, odds are they could get it on your website., You need to figure out exactly what you could bring to your prospect and how what you bring can further their overall goals. You already have the first part from your discussions of the customer's problem. However, for the second part you will need an idea of what the customer wants to achieve overall. Try coming at this directly with something like, ""What are you looking to accomplish in the next few years?"" or ""What is the primary long-term goal of your business?"".


From here, you can tailor the language and content of your product or service offering to how you can help them along the path to achieving their goals., You can also draw out customer desires by asking them to imagine the future of their business or life. You can either ask about how their life or business will be in the future or how they hope your business relationship will develop. For example, try asking, ""Where do you see yourself/your company in five years? Ten years?"" or, ""How do you see your business developing if we go through with this deal?"". You can gather even more information by asking other hypothetical questions like, ""If you had no monetary constraints, what changes would you make?"". Listen to these responses and think about the solutions you could provide., At regular intervals, especially if you are explaining something complex, stop to ask your customer if they have any questions. This not only keeps them engaged, but can keep you from having to go back and explain something you've already moved past. In any case, try to maintain an air of helpfulness and take the time to explain anything the customer doesn't understand, as well as to understand their concerns as deeply as possible. And when your customer is thinking about their answers or questions, wait patiently and quietly."

If you do not want to have to explain your situation to everyone in your office, you may want to tell your boss to let everyone know for you.

, Many jobs offer some kind of bereavement leave when someone in your immediate family or a close friend dies. This may be a few days, and some companies may offer up to a week or two. This time allows you the chance to arrange funerals and take care of other details surrounding the death.This bereavement leave may not be long enough for you to cope and deal with the grief. If you cannot take more time off, try to rest and use the time off you do get to do as much as you can.

, Many employers expect you to ignore the grief and be back at work immediately. They may expect you to be fine, at your best, and âover it.â Realize that grief is a process that takes time to work through. You will need time to heal.There is no normal time to grieve for a loss. However, if you are unable to function and do your job after a month or more, you should consider seeing a mental health specialist to help you deal with your grief.

, When you are coping with workplace grief, it may be difficult to focus on your work. If you are unable to take any more time off, you may need to figure out the best way to be productive. It may help to prioritize the work you need to do. This way, you can focus on finishing the most pressing tasks and not worry about less important things.For example, if you have an inbox full of emails, focus on replying to the ones that must be dealt with today.

I was wondering if I could have a lighter workload while I overcome this loss.â

, When you experience a loss, you should reach out to your coworkers, managers, and supervisors. Share with them what you feel comfortable sharing. Then, ask for help if you need it. You donât have to do everything on your own.For example, you may say, âIâm struggling getting things done because I canât concentrate. I was hoping you could help me just for a few days until I get my bearings again.â

, If you have trouble adjusting back to your job after a loss, you may want to see a mental health professional. Even if you talked with a company counselor, you may need more support. Remember, that is okay.

You can send a small bouquet of flowers or some other small gift, a card, or just an email that says, âIâm sorry for your loss.â

, If your coworker has suffered a significant loss, be available to them. Ask them if there is anything work-related you can help them with or if you can take some of their work while they cope and recover.


You may say, ""I am sorry for your loss. I would be willing to help you out around the office until you feel better. Is there anything I can do to help lighten your workload?""

, Sometimes, having someone listen can be the most helpful way you can show support. When you listen to your coworker, don't offer empty words or try to make them feel better. Just let them know you are listening and that you are there for them.


For example, you may want to say, ""I am sorry for your loss. I want you to know I am here to listen if you need someone to talk to.""
If you have suffered a similar loss, you may want to share that information. Just make sure not to try to one-up or belittle their loss. You may say, ""I'm sorry for your loss.

Actively engage with your customer.Once you've met up with your prospective customer, you should engage with them as if they were a casual friend, rather than purely as a business associate.,
Put the customer first.Even if your ultimate goal is to sell a product, you can only maximize your chances of that if you put your customers needs before your own.,
Know your product.,
Frame the product as part of the customer's ideal lifestyle.,
Close the deal.,
Remember to do a follow-up.There are two reasons to get in touch with a customer following a sale.",How to Sell Anything to Anybody," Many business gurus will state you need to look your best if you want to maximize your sales potential. While this is absolutely true, it doesn't necessarily mean dressing up in your finest suit. Rather, you should dress the way you think your customer would feel most comfortable and impressed with. Formal business wear is fairly standard in upper-level business spheres, but more casual settings might favour appropriately casual dress. As much as you'll want to impress the customer with your professionalism and adhere to the workplace's dress code, you also want to appear approachable and friendly.


If you're making the sale employed under someone else, you'll also obviously need to consider how your boss will react to your wardrobe before taking the customer's whims into consideration.
Semi-formal business wear fits the vast majority of business situations if you're unsure. As a rule, it is better to be too formal than too casual. Being too formal might make it harder to relate with the customer, but being too casual will make it harder for the customer to respect you. Respect is essential if you want to make a sale work.;
, Punctuality is an incredibly simple (and easy) way to impress a customer and just about anyone else you'll be dealing with professionally. This doesn't just mean getting somewhere on time; it means being absolutely ready for whatever time you set to meet. This could involve coming fifteen minutes earlier than you are expected. By coming early, you'll have all of your things ready and have time to adjust for any unforeseen complications.


An important side effect to punctuality is how much less stressed you'll feel. If you're prone to stress, getting to a sales meeting early will give you time to get your bearings and relax.

, Part of a great sales routine is knowing exactly what you have to offer, and the kind of person that is going to want what you're selling.If you have the ideal customer in mind, you can start to go ahead and imagine the sort of salesman they would be most inclined to buy from. Being able to predict your ideal customer's ideal salesman will gradually inform the way you present yourself.


The more specific the type of customers you attract, the better (and easier) business will be for you., What needs or desires does your customer have? And more specifically: How might those desires be sated by the product you have to offer? The key to positive, mutually beneficial interaction is being able to see things from the other person's point-of-view.


Even if you don't know the customer on a personal basis, you can still assume a great deal about what they need. Most customers coming to one location are looking to have similar needs fulfilled. If you've dealt with enough customers in the past, you may have already seen some common patterns emerge.
If it's another professional you're selling to, checking out his LinkedIn profile and looking into his industry will give you greater insight as to what he may be looking for., Within the first few minutes of meeting with a prospective customer, you should be able to roughly determine how likely the sale is to go through. If you suspect the customer doesn't have a need for your product or doesn't have the funds to pay for it, it's best to speed the process along amicably. Although all customers should be treated with patience and respect regardless of your predicted chances, you don't want to waste time that might better be spent helping other people., Given some of the bad stigma towards sales representatives, many people have the negative impression that salesmen are only out there to take their money. In order to instill a positive relationship with the customer, you must show interest in them as a human being.


This can be as simple as asking them how they're doing today, or how their trip over to the meeting was.
Actively engaging means doing without prepared sales pitches. If customers get the impression that a pitch has been memorized beforehand, they will have a hard time feeling engaged by it, even if the pitch itself is well-presented.
For example, you might say something like this to appear warm to your customer: ""It's great to have you here. Did you have a pleasant trip over?""

, People are quick to notice when someone sincerely cares about them, and even quicker to tell when they're getting the short end of the stick. The only way to ensure the customer will believe you're on their side is to actually be on their side.


If you're having trouble figuring out how to manifest this idea in a real-life sales situation, try to picture yourself in the other person's shoes. What does the customer want? How might he be reacting to your tone, and what will it take for him to leave the meeting feeling happy and satisfied?

, It should be taken as a granted that you cannot hope to sell something without having some knowledge of what it is and how it might benefit someone. Whether it's a used television or a hot stock, you should take time to analyze the product you're pitching. Try to look at it objectively as well as emotionally. Potential buyers are driven by emotions as much as logic, so it's important to consider subjectivity in your analysis.A hot stock, for example, may carry a logical risk and reward, but it also represents a dream of possibly making a lot of money quickly.
If you take a look at successful marketing campaigns, you'll find that products are rarely sold primarily due to superior technical specifications or anything logical. Consumers are more driven by egocentrism and what some might call a ""coolness"" factor.So long as the product meets a basic standard of function, a large portion of a given consumer base will be open to purchasing it.

, All people, customers or not, are ultimately striving for their ideal of a good life. While the particulars may vary significantly from person to person, most people want many of the same things: success, relative comfort, and the respect of their peers. It doesn't matter what the product itself is; for a product to be sold effectively, there has to be a part of the customer's life it will benefit or improve. Form a synthesis between what you know of the customer's needs and the benefits of the product. Build your sales pitch on whatever overlap there is.


For example, someone selling a new refrigerator might highlight how it will benefit the customer's energy efficiency and the appliance's superior ease-of-use when compared to their current model.

, A sales process is never complete without the act of selling itself. Make the applicable transaction between buyer and seller, whether that's an exchange of cash or signing a lease. You should never been too confident before a deal is closed officially. On occasion, customers will get cold feet at the last minute and duck out, and acting like you've already won them over before that time may put undue pressure on them.


Don't wait too long to close the deal.It's natural to feel some trepidation when it comes time to finalize a sale. No salesman likes having his pitch rejected. All the same, if you leave a sale in progress for too long, you may lose momentum and have your business stolen by more aggressive competition.

, Even if you've already sealed the deal with them, contacting them later on to ask about their experience with the product creates a professional relationship beyond the sales pressure itself. Secondly, in getting feedback from a customer, you may receive helpful advice regarding your sales approach.


Returning customers are where you are going to make the majority of your money in most business environments. Offering returning customers a special discount or offer is a great way of convincing them to come back.While most customers won't fill out a customer response survey on their own time, many can be persuaded to do so if you offer a special perk, such as a discount for repeated service.Done in this fashion, you're not only able to promote returning customers; you're also able to ensure a steady stream of feedback.

Decide the specific monetary and product needs before choosing the type of promotion you will use.;
, Your online or in-store databases should keep track of customers, their purchases, each offer they respond to and other preferences. Before starting any promotion, you should aim to target it first at the customers who are most likely to buy based on these preferences.

, Simply taking a percentage off a sale price may encourage bargain hunters to buy, but many companies try to encourage customers to buy greater quantities, such as ""buy one get one half off"" sales. The following are some possible sales promotions to consider.


Consider giving a free gift with any purchase. If you find a product that is fairly low cost to produce, it can encourage people to buy at regular prices but enjoy the feeling of getting something free. This may be a good option if you are introducing a new, low-cost product that may encourage repeat customers or a way to get your brand out there, if the product features your logo. Advertise the retail value of the free product to increase the perceived value for the consumer.
Bundle your most popular products with a less popular product. Discount the package so that you are moving more products while keeping the discount level lower.
Offer free services or consultations for a limited time. Service-based businesses can garner new customers by doing risk-free consultations. Once the customer has contacted you, they are more likely to convert to a customer than a cold call. You may also consider offering free upgrades or free trial with service-based businesses.
Offer free lessons on certain days. Teaching a sewing class, a beer brewing class or a financial planning class will help get people in the door. You can offer them a starter kit while they are in there or simply encourage them to buy the materials for the class.
Partner with other businesses on sales promotions. Split the cost of marketing and give a free gift, coupon or sidewalk sale that encourages customer sharing.
Hold a contest. Give something, such as a coupon, to everyone who participates. This is an excellent way to boost online traffic.

, Your marketing and bookkeeping staff should be able to specify any losses that sales could bring, break-even points and potential returns on investment (ROI). Ultimately, you should choose the promotion with the best financial prospects.


If you are considering a coupon or discount percentage, make sure you choose your percentage offer carefully. The coupon should seem like an excellent deal, which often means they are over 20 percent. However, it should be a financially viable coupon. Remember that if you have a low mark up on products, these coupons may not be the best promotion decision.

, Part of encouraging people to buy a product is communicating that this is an offer that will be available for a limited time. In general, the greater the discount or offer, the less time it will be available, in order to suggest it is a very good deal that cannot be available all the time.

, Identify a target number of people you want to reach and a realistic conversion rate for those people. This will help to plan out the size of your marketing campaign.

, Your marketing team or marketing consultant should come up with a complete view of the process from the message to the creative elements to data gathering. Invest plenty of time in this and you will have a better promotion and more data to analyze after the fact.

, A sales promotion is not as simple as offering a coupon. It should be used to encourage brand recognition and repeat customers.


Invest in creative services. Professional graphic designers, voice talent, photographers, writers and models can offer you a marketing product that will reach more people and have more success than what you can do by yourself. If you have organized these elements in the past, consider hiring a professional to do the coupons, radio recording or posters to see how much an attractive, professional promotion can increase sales.

, A sales promotion should have everyone on board, from bookkeeper to sales staff. Encourage ideas from employees. A team based approach will allow you to keep track of how the process is handled and improve your future promotions.

, Ask your marketing professional to do the math on your ROI, conversion rate and percentage increase in customers. Evaluate your success after the fact.

, Try a new type of promotion if the previous one was not successful. Although planning will increase the success of your promotion, there is always an element of trial and error in marketing.

Some salespeople end up in this field without learning to speak effectively, so take the time to learn now.;
, Ask your company to pay for training if managing your day is the biggest impediment to sales. Most proficiency experts agree that you should do your most important tasks in the morning, to improve the success of your day.

, You may have heard of interval fitness training, and the same principles can apply to your sales schedule. Start your day by calling your most important clients, take a 1 hour break to do email, do a cold call power hour, take a break for admin tasks and return to calling in hour intervals throughout the day.


Close your email program when you are calling. Consider this time sacred. Focus on the call, take notes as needed and avoid allowing other distractions.

, Overall, you can personalize your sales process to the client if you listen closely. Use the information to establish a clients pain points, preferences and needs.


Listening is an excellent skill. Don't jump into a sale pitch until you have asked potential clients what they are looking for and what their worries are. Add a few questions to your sales process.

, Add PowerPoint presentations to your laptop or print color copies of promotional materials. Ask your company's marketing department for help creating materials if you are unable to do it yourself.

, Unless you are qualifying leads and you are not finding good potential, each call should end with an appointment scheduled or a task for your client to complete. Get your client involved in the process immediately, because they are likely to forget about your phone call or meeting when the next task starts.

, Subscribe to industry journals, read blogs, research competition and visit lectures and seminars. If you are able to supply information to your client that reaches further than just your product, you can become their first resource when they want to make changes.

, Start a LinkedIn Profile and website biography that you aren't afraid to share with clients. Avoid using social media, like Facebook, where people can post personal or inappropriate information where clients can see.

, Choose a favorite song, get your favorite beverage or watch your favorite YouTube clip to increase your energy and enthusiasm.

, Try to change and improve it every week. Adding new information from research or current events will allow your information to seem relevant during the sale.

, Send birthday cards, thank you notes or informational emails. Establish a personal connection, while you go above and beyond to meet their needs.

, Examine your sales pitch to see if you would buy the product you are selling. Develop several other ways to ask questions and deliver information that might spark your interest if you were on the other side of a sale., Leverage your strong relationships by asking if they know of other businesses that could use your services. Although you don't want to ask every time, make sure you have asked for referrals from each of them within the last year.


Practice several ways of asking for referrals. Some salespeople feel awkward asking, so figure out ways to fit it into a call seamlessly. For example, instead of saying ""Do you know anyone who would be interested in this product?"" try ""This is a limited discount, do you want me to share it with anyone?""

Go on a scavenger hunt.,
Give gifts away.,
Find something inexpensive to sell.,
Always ask for the sale.,
Make your price more than $1 if you're having success.

",How to Improve Selling Skills Using the Sales Game," Walk around a neighborhood and knock on a door. Look the person in the eye and see what goes on in your body. Tell them you're on a scavenger hunt and ask if they have a paperclip, canceled stamp, piece of junk mail, potato chip, etc. (use your imagination). If they ask you why you're doing it, tell them you're working on being more friendly and talking to strangers. Do this until it becomes completely natural.;
, Find something inexpensive. (Don't worry about the stories in your head or what people will say/think, most people throw them away). Wrap them in Xmas wrapping paper or some other gift wrap. Start with 10 and approach random people and come up with a story that is natural to you. (Notice how we usually tell white lies...try telling the truth). Notice what goes on in your body when people say no and look at you strangely. Don't worry about them, just go on to someone else. The next 10 give to someone of the opposite sex you find attractive. After that, the final 10 should go to someone of the same sex who reminds you of your parent of that sex.

, Under a buck. Then create a sales script that you can memorize. Make the pitch less than 60 seconds long. Something like this: ""Hi, you look like you might like to have fun. (This stops them, you've got about 10 seconds to keep their attention). I'm supposed to sell these ""articles"" and if I can't have fun doing it, I don't want to do it. It takes 60 seconds, would you listen?"" If they say no, say thanks and you're on to your next prospect. If they say yes, give them the rest of your pitch. Tell them it's a game that your playing to break up your habit of not approaching strangers. Be light. Have fun. Watch their eyes and see if you can smile and connect with them.

, ""Would you buy this ""article"" for $1 now?) Most people never ask for the sale, you've got to ask every time. If they say ""no"" say ok, I had fun and thanks for playing (this is a game). If they say ""yes,"" make the exchange and see how great you feel.

Don't overdo your clothing. A new, finely tailored suit can be somewhat intimidating, especially if it makes you look incredibly out of place in the neighborhood you are walking through.;
, During the work week, most people are at home and willing to answer their door between the hours of 5:00 and 9:00 pm. You may get people at home during traditional 9:00 am to 5:00 pm work hours, but not as many. Early in the morning is not good, as many people up and about are looking to go to work, not listen to a sales pitch., Step away from the door after knocking. It's less intimidating and respects personal space.

, Avoid your sales pitch at first. A simple, ""Hello, how are you today?"" treats each person as an individual rather than just a potential customer. You want the person to trust you and want to talk to you.


Observe your surroundings when approaching the door and gather hints on the customer's interests to help break the ice.
Tweak your introduction from time to time to keep things fresh. It can be easy to fall into a rut, and act like you are reading prepared remarks rather than talking to someone.

, You aren't just selling a product, you are selling yourself as a trustworthy representative of the company you work for. Potential customers should want to invite you in for more information. It's always better to smile and make eye contact as much as possible., Most doors you knock on will not want to talk to you. Don't get discouraged by people saying no. You aren't looking for everyone to buy your products, just the people who are interested.

, You need to be sure you know everything there is to know about what it is you are trying to display, and answer any and all questions that your potential customers have. This is true whether you selling a company's ""top of the line"" merchandise, or you just want to get some extra cash for homemade items.


This will allow you to explain the product on a personal level. You don't want to dive right into the bullet points. Instead, let your customer know how this will benefit their life.
Be honest about what your product can and cannot do. You won't always have a good answer to a customer's question, but don't make promises your product can't keep. Instead, try to turn the conversation back towards your product's strengths.

, You have a very short window of time to capture a buyer's interest in your product. Keep this introduction casual. You don't want to come off as overly animated. This is an in-person presentation, not a goofy television commercial.


You can say something like, ""I'm (your name), and I'm visiting your neighborhood to inform people about (your product or service). Let me show you what I've got."" Get to the point quickly, so you don't waste time talking to a customer who isn't interested.

, Sadly, many scams use door to door salesmen to snare victims, so you may want business cards or something tangible to prove that you a verified sales representative for an actual company. If you are working independently, you will want some of your product with you, and be willing to sell right away.

, Pick up hints in tone and body language that indicate interest in you or your product. Interested people tend to maintain eye contact, lean forward, or tilt their head when you talk. Give them a chance to talk, ask questions, or offer suggestions about how they might be interested in using your product.If the conversation starts to drag, move on to discussing the product. If the customer is not showing any signs of interest, thank them for their time, and move on to the next door.


Keep an eye out for negative body language as well. Crossed arms or eyes looking elsewhere indicate the person is not interested, or is trying to keep you at a distance.

, If a person seems interested, but not yet willing to buy, offer to show them the product and how it works. If the person at the door expresses interest, say, ""let me show you,"" rather than, ""can I"" or ""may I."" Those phrases open a window for the person to say no. It also looks pushy, like you are trying to force your way into someone else's house.


Trust your product to work. Don't offer excuses before you show what it does or can do. You need to demonstrate that what you are selling is quality and worthwhile.
Showing your product also gives the customer a chance to think about how it might be useful to them. Encourage them to describe their needs, and answer any questions.

, Chances are that after going to a bunch of houses, you will hear certain similarities in disinterest. Keep an eye out for these basic themes, and prepare answers. You may not always get past them, but you will be prepared to address some early concerns.A negative buyer can still be open to persuasion. Don't see those negative responses as refusals, but as opportunities to give more information.

, Your potential customer needs to know that what you are selling will give them something they want. You should know the difference between a ""benefit"" and a ""feature."" A feature is something your product does, such as a vacuum that picks up more dirt than its competitors. A benefit is what you get from that feature. For that vacuum, the benefit would be a cleaner, healthier home., If your potential customer seems unwilling to buy, let your enthusiasm guide them. If they can't believe that you like or believe in your product, why should they?

, Most people will not want to stand in their doorway for too long, so if there is an opportunity to talk further, they will generally invite you inside. If possible, try to get contact information. With that, you can always offer to come back or call at another time.


If you have fliers, business cards, or other printed materials with your contact information, this is a good moment to pass them out. If you don't have any, it might be good to get some.

, If a person gives you a direct ""No"" in response to your offers, thank them for their time and move on to the next house. There is no benefit to pushing that person any further.

Anticipate potential objections.,
Be concise.,
Get to the real objection.,
Relate to the reservation.,
Acknowledge disadvantages.,
Make a conditional agreement.,
Remain patient with the customer.",How to Handle Sales Objections,"


Be aware of areas where potential clients could voice objections and address these in your sales presentation. For example, explain how your product is made better, is made in America, offers a longer warranty, or includes more standard features, if the client complains that your product is more expensive than a competitor's. This lets the potential client know you're not denying the objection and allows you to explain why it's irrelevant.;
,


A potential client with objections or reservations doesn't want to listen to a long explanation of why to buy your product. Make your argument short with only the necessary facts to get the client to change their mind. This will prevent the individual from feeling that you're wasting their time.

,


Ask direct questions to better understand an objection given to your sales pitch. Ask a client whose objection is the price of the product if they have budget restrictions, and if you can sign them up for a payment plan, or if it would help if you discounted the price. This will satisfy the objection if price is the real issue, or you will be able to get to the real reason they're hesitating if price isn't really it.

,


A client will be more likely to agree to a sale if they feel that you understand why they're unsure. Tell the client you understand the reservation and that you want to make them comfortable with the decision, then explain what facets of your product or service will work for them.

,


A potential client might reject a sales pitch because of legitimate issues relating to cost, shipment time, product details. Accept these disadvantages and then show the client how the advantages and positive selling points outweigh the drawbacks. For example, agree that the shipping time is 2 business days longer than the competitor, but explain that you guarantee delivery and the competitor doesn't.

,


A client could object to your sales offer because of 1 or 2 details that aren't being addressed or that aren't customarily offered to new clients. Agree to get the client the specific size, color or length of contract they want if they sign up with you that day. This helps you close the sale and satisfy the client's concerns.

,


A client that senses you're getting impatient or frustrated with their reservations will decide that you don't care about their concerns and only want the sale. Continue to smile and stay patient until you've answered all the client's questions and concerns.

""Sales pitch"" can be a misleading term. There will be no single script you can use on every customer. The case you make will differ from sale to sale.
Crafting a sales pitch isn't about designing the perfect script. You simply need to know how to approach each customer at the start and which conversational points to touch on while learning about the customer.;
, Know the product well. Familiarize yourself with its benefits and limitations. In doing so, you can more readily anticipate common customer concerns and prepare appropriate responses.


When you know who your customer is before you actually meet, you have the chance to do a little research. Find out what motivates him or her. Doing so can help you tailor-fit your sales pitch to that customer's unique interests.

, You'll want to treat your customer with care, but acknowledge your own value at the same time. Understand your worth as a person and as a salesperson. This can boost your level of confidence, to which many customers will respond favorably. View yourself as someone who satisfies others' needs and desires. When framed with that perspective, the job of a salesperson is an important one that can be used genuinely to improve the lives of your customers.

, Take the time to practice your sales pitch before you meet a new customer. You can practice alone, or ask an employer, coworker, or friend to listen and provide constructive criticism.


Try running through a few different scenarios. Practice pitching your product to different types of customers with different sets of concerns.

, Ask the customer questions and learn as much as you can about his or her needs. Your customer should feel as though you care about him or her as a person. The only way to do that is to actually treat your customer like a person instead of a source of profit.


Some customers may have a hard time describing what they need, so it will be your job to ask questions that can help them explain what they hope to find.

, When talking to the customer, your full attention should be focused on that specific person. This is not the time to check your text messages or chitchat with a passing co-worker.


It isn't enough simply to look as though you're giving the customer your attention. Prove it by listening actively. As the customer asks questions, address them spontaneously instead of with a scripted line.

, Rambling off a generic sales pitch won't impress most customers. You need to listen to what your customer has to say before making your own remarks. In some cases, you may actually need to say more than your customer says, but your words should always be chosen in response to theirs.


Talking as much as 70 percent of the time should be your limit, but an even better ratio would be 50 percent talking and 50 percent listening.
When you do respond, abandon your talking points and directly address the customer's concerns by providing adequate answers and by asking meaningful questions about his or her circumstances.

, If your customer knows a little about you, he or she may develop some fondness for you as a person. People are generally more likely to buy from someone they like than someone they dislike or feel indifferent toward. It's especially impactful when you offer information your customer can relate to. A shared experience or interest can create an instant connection. For instance, if your customer is wearing a sweatshirt with the name of your alma mater on it, that might be a point worth mentioning.

, Most customers respond well to humor. Be serious about the value of the product and the possible purchase, but introduce light humor into the conversation to break the ice and maintain a pleasant atmosphere. You don't need to be a comedian. The idea is to make your customer smile and perhaps elicit a small chuckle. You don't need to make your customer howl with heavy laughter.
Consider using self-deprecating humor. In most cases it will make you appear less threatening and more relatable.
Avoid humor that could be offensive or that might not make sense to most people.

, No matter how rude, undecided, or impatient your customer is, you should react with patience and respect. Even if the conversation doesn't end in a sale, it is still a good idea to end on good terms.


The difficult customer you're dealing with may simply be having a bad day. Talking with the customer in a civilized manner could calm him or her down. Even if it doesn't, that customer may return at a later date in a better mood.
The only exceptions would be when the customer is creating a major disturbance for other customers or when that customer presents some threat to you or another employee.

, Bending the truth might seem tempting, but ultimately a lie will be discovered, and your customer will be unhappy. You may have made a sale in the process, but you will probably never sell to that customer again.


On the other hand, being honest with a customer will typically earn respect and appreciation. He or she is more likely to return later to shop for new products or to buy the original product once need for it arises. As a result, you will probably establish a better long-term relationship with that customer, leading to possible future sales (and good references).
A dissatisfied customer may spread word of his or her experience to others. Once that customer's network discovers that you lied to him or her, everyone in the network will be less likely to consider buying from you.

, Not every customer will have a use for every product. Be honest with your customers even if it might kill a sale. Wasting time trying to sell a product your customer doesn't need will not do either of you any favors. If the product you're selling really isn't right for a particular customer, don't be afraid to say so. Provide an explanation so your customer knows that you are ending the conversation for his or her own benefit.
When possible you might consider recommending a different product to your customer that might fit his or her needs better.

, Often the problem your customer thinks he or she has is not the problem he or she actually has. Listen to the words your customer uses, and try to identify any hidden meanings beneath those words.


Typically the problem your customer identifies will be an actual problem, but it may also be a symptom of a larger, more significant problem. Your goal is to point out the underlying problem and make a sale that can address it, rather than merely fixing the surface issue.

, Helping the customer is important, but ultimately you shouldn't spend an hour giving a customer advice and consultation when he or she has no intention of buying from you.


Give advice only when it can lead to a purchase. Once it becomes obvious that your customer is no longer interested in buying, or that your product will no longer match the needs of your customer, it is best to stop the conversation and move on.

, Some of your customer's concerns will be valid, but many will be misinformed. When a misinformed objection comes up, take a few minutes to politely address and correct it.


Most objections will concern budget, authority, need, or time.
Your response will vary on a case-by-case basis. Most objections can be addressed by explaining why the matter at hand does not need to concern your customer as much as it does. When this is not possible, demonstrate how the value of the product outweighs the potential downfall your customer is concerned about.

, Ultimately customers want a product that will solve some problem or need they currently have. You'll make a sale only if you can demonstrate how your product will effectively solve the problem or answer the need.


This is when you'll need your sales pitch. Use what you know about the customer and the product to show a perfect connection between the two.

, Regardless of whether you make the sale, keep the door open for future communication with each customer. Doing so may lead to a sale later on.


Every talk you have with a potential customer should involve a call to action.
When you don't complete the sale, encourage the customer to review the information and return in a few days. Depending on the circumstances, you may even offer to contact the customer so he or she doesn't need to call you.
When you do complete the sale, encourage the customer to stay in touch and tell you how the product is working. Follow up with an e-mail or phone call to that point when appropriate.

Identify your ideal customer.,
Refine your product to meet customer needs.,
Improve quality control.,
Analyze your pricing strategy.",How to Maximize Your Sales1," In order to determine the best way to refine and then sell your product or service, you'll need to identify your ideal customer. Start by looking at the benefits that your product offers and thinking about whose needs are best met by those benefits. Work to identify this person from a demographic standpoint, including their gender, age, education, income, and location. Try to understand their values and interests. The clearer picture you can get of your ideal customer, the easier you can sell to them.For example, the owner of a high-quality music streaming service might find that his service appeals most to young adult to adult males with large amounts of disposable income who live in urban areas.;
, You should constantly make an effort to reassess the quality and usefulness of your product to your ideal customer. Accept and solicit feedback from customers about issues they've had with your product or service. You can then make changes to suit their needs and eliminate defects. Doing so will keep your product or service competitive and help you retain customers., In order to build customer loyalty, prevent negative reviews, and reduce return expenses, you'll need to find a way to improve quality control on your products or services. Set a product quality goal and determine how you will measure customer satisfaction. From there, you can invest in training for your employees and institute ways to ensure that each product is checked thoroughly before reaching your customer.For example, set a goal for a maximum percentage of damaged or faulty products you're okay with producing, for a certain number of customer complaints you think is acceptable, or for a certain customer wait time.

, In theory, there is an ideal price for your product or service where supply meets demand. However, actually finding that point can be difficult. Setting the price too high can drive away potential buyers and setting it too low cuts into your margins. Start looking into your pricing strategy by examining how your competitors are pricing their products. Then, adjust your price for the perceived quality of your product, if necessary.


If your product is sold as premium alternative, you may be able to charge more than competitors. If it is a discount option, expect to charge less than competitors.
You can always adjust your prices to see how your sales will respond. This method of trial and error might hurt your bottom line for a while, but finding the best price point will help you in the long run."
"
Determine your competitive advantage.,
Focus on your audience's needs.,
Provide specifics about your offerings.,
Track and analyze your marketing strategies.",How to Maximize Your Sales2," Your competitive advantage is what your business offers customers that your competitors cannot offer. Competitive advantages can arise from exclusivity, quality, uniqueness, or cost. For example, one business might be able to undercut all of its competitors on price and remain profitable. Another business might have a competitive advantage by offering a unique or patented service. Figure out what your competitive advantage is and then use it to form your primary marketing statement.For example, the premium music streaming service mentioned in the previous example might advertise as ""the only platform that streams at a rate of 1411 kbps.""

, Your marketing efforts need to effectively get your message across to your ideal customers. Focus on tailoring your message so that it speaks to the problems and needs of your ideal customer. Your advertising content and visuals need to be in line with the interests and values of your ideal customer while still reflecting your business's brand.


Try to pinpoint your target customer's ""pain points,"" which are problems that your product or service can solve, and design your marketing strategies around addressing them.

For example, a customer might be unhappy with the quality of the product or service they are currently using. Other pain points might include high prices or hard to use products or services.


This should also be applied to the channel you use for advertising. Only use those that your ideal customers are likely to use as well.For example, some customers may not use the radio or television very frequently, but often find themselves browsing online. In that case, you would want to focus marketing efforts online.



, Your marketing materials need to do more than just tell your ideal customer that you can fix their problems. You need to give product details in a concise way, being clear about exactly how your product or service is used and what it does.


Then, provide proof of your claims by offering some type of data or content to back up your claims.
These can include customer testimonials, reviews, success rates, rankings, or other statistics., Whenever you launch a new marketing strategy, make sure to track your returns from that strategy. Look for rises in sales that occurred after a new strategy was implemented. You can then compare the return to the cost of the strategy to assess your return on investment.


This metric can then be used to redirect future marketing efforts to make them more efficient and effective."
"
Create a sales plan.,
Gather more sales leads.,
Analyze and improve your conversion strategy.,
Focus on improving customer relationships.",How to Maximize Your Sales3," You sales team should operate based on a sales plan that prescribes certain actions for each step of the sales cycle. Salespeople should know how to generate leads and what to do at each stage of customer interest before a sale. Then, the team should be skilled in driving referrals and repeat business after the sale. The sales plan should be designed to direct them at each of these stages., Sales leads are prospective customers that may be interested in your product or service and have provided contact information. You can improve your odds of earning a sale by starting from a larger pool of sales leads. Direct your salespeople to use a variety of methods to increase sales leads. Everything from simple cold calling to local networking can help you gain exposure for your product or service and reach a larger audience of potential customers.


You can also work through referrals by previous customers and by ""influencers"" to reach large groups of new customers.
Another option is to try affiliate marketing, which is working with another business that attracts similar customers, but not does directly compete with you, to promote each other's products or services., Your sales team should have a strategy in place to convert customer awareness into sales. Try creating an ideal timeline for the conversion process, including points of contact and the desired result of each. Work on figuring out the best way to get potential customer contact information and how to get your message to them through various channels.


Analyze the effectiveness of promotions, different contact methods, and direct solicitations on your conversion rate.
Focus on building a relationship and selling value, rather than just selling the customer as much as you can., The goal of your sales team, beyond increasing sales, should be to develop relationships with customers. Customers should think of your sales team members as trusted advisors in your industry that can help them choose the right product or service for their needs.


Train your salespeople to listen to customers in an effort to identify their problems and hesitations about buying.
They should be able to link those problems to the benefits offered by your product or service and address any hesitations the buyer might have."
"
Follow up with customers after the sale.,
Identify your best customers.,
Create a loyalty program.,
Sell customers complementary or similar products.,
Offer discounts and other benefits.,
Build a strong brand.",How to Maximize Your Sales4," If at all possible, follow up with your customers after the sale. Work to get the customer's address or email address during the transaction process. Then, send them a simple thank-you message and contact information they can use to get in touch with you if they have any problems with your product. This space can also be used as an opportunity to promote complementary add-ons to the product or service they purchased.


Give the customer the option to opt in to your mailing list so that you can send them regular updates.
Use a mailing service, whether physical or email, to send out updates and special offers to your mailing list every few weeks or once a month., A well-known philosophy of business states that 80 percent of your sales come from 20 percent of your customers. These are your largest, best customers. Because they provide the majority of your business, they should also receive the majority of your attention. This also includes those customers who recommend your business to friends and those who are frequent returning customers. Identify these customers by looking at your sales records.


Once you have a list of your best customers, look for similarities between them. If they're businesses, are they primarily big or small? If they are individuals, what are their primary demographic qualities?
Use this information to focus your marketing efforts., Loyalty programs can be a good way to retain your best customers. They can come in several forms, including points earned for purchases, monthly or annual spending tiers, or VIP programs that offer special savings or exclusive products. A VIP program can even be a paid program where a customers pay an annual fee to have access to discounts. This ensures that customers will continue buying from you as long as they are in the VIP program, as they have already invested in it., Businesses can increase their sales by offering complementary products. These ""add-ons"" go with or are necessary to the functioning of your primary product or service. You can offer these add-ons to customers during or after the transaction as a way to quickly increase your sales. These add-ons should be framed as a convenience so that the customer doesn't feel like they are being up-sold.For example, coffee shops often sell pastries or other breakfast foods that can be purchased with the coffee.
Salespeople need to be trained in explaining the benefits of add-ons clearly and convincingly. This will help the customer see how they work together to create a complete package., You can drive customers to purchase more of your product by offering discounts, benefits like free shipping, or free trials or samples of your products or services. These can be offered to existing customers through your mailing list or given to customers who reach a certain purchase threshold.


For example, you might give a 10 percent discount to customers who purchase more than $200 worth of goods.
However, don't offer too many of these discounts or make the threshold very low. If you do, customers will start to consider your products or services to be worth less than full price., A powerful way to build customer loyalty is by cultivating a strong brand for your business. Your brand is the sum of the customer-facing aspects of your business and includes your product strategy, business values, community involvement, marketing, customer experience, and every other aspect of your business that customers can see.


Work to standardized your brand across your marketing materials, employees, and business locations.
If customers know they can trust their experience with your product and customer service, they will be more likely to choose you over competitors."

Hire sales trainers that are willing to customize sales training programs to your business.,
Apply time management techniques to the sales training.,
Choose a few short training sessions over 1 long session.,
Split up your sales team, in order to maximize their strengths.,
Make the information available to your salespeople after the training session.,
Use advanced technology whenever possible.,
Make sure your sales team recognizes what is expected of them.,
Follow up on the sales training.",How to Improve the Effectiveness of Sales Training," Have your sales leadership team meet with trainers ahead of time so that they can understand your business and your strategic initiatives. Many industries must sell to niche markets where general sales tactics need to be adjusted, so that your sales team can use them immediately.;
, A successful salesperson excels at time management, so ask yourself if your sales trainer and sessions also apply these rules of time management. If the sales trainer cannot explain and distribute information quickly and effectively, your sales representatives will find it hard to do so as well.

, A 15 to 30 minute sales training session covering 1 topic, followed by practice, is often better than a 2 hour session followed by lunch. Plan the sessions so that they happen right before people have to get on the phones or meet with clients.


You may recommend that the salespeople practice new tactics on low-grade leads before employing them on their best leads. Have your sales trainer listen to your salespeople so that the next session can be adjusted to their strengths or weaknesses.

, New hires, people with a few years of experience and seasoned salespeople should not be lumped together in 1 training session, unless it is short and absolutely necessary. Trainers can give personal attention with smaller groups, and they can expect to train based on the level of experience, cutting out unnecessary information for some people and creating simpler steps for new trainees.

, Do not hand out pieces of paper during the session. Get them actively involved and listening when they are training, and then email the notes or post a webinar that they can refer back to later.


If you are hiring a sales trainer from outside of the company, ask that they provide a webinar that can be used a month after the training. Ask that your salespeople revisit things that were unclear to them in 15 to 20 minute intervals. Repetition, 3 or more times, helps commit the training to memory.

, As well as webinars, make sure your sales trainers are using PowerPoint presentations, videos and engaging information whenever possible. Trainers should not stand in front of salespeople and speak at them, they should ask questions, entertain and show the procedure with examples.

, Establish sales goals based on the training, whether it is adopting a new technology in the sales process or closing more sales. Give sales incentives for adopting the new practices quickly and finding creative ways to adapt the procedures to their own style.

, Ask your salespeople to give you feedback on what was and was not effective about each training session. This could be a survey or a quick email, but if you find you are getting the same negative or positive feedback, then adjust your later sessions to be more productive.

Study and become knowledgeable in the veterinary medicine industry, particularly the pharmacological aspect of it.,
Develop your organizational skills.,
Freshen up your resume.,
Network with others in the veterinary medicine field.,
Get your certification in pharmaceutical sales.",How to Get an Animal Pharmaceutical Sales Job,"


Although there is no discipline in college that speaks directly to animal pharmaceutical sales, it is still wise to get a degree in an area that is, at least, indirectly related.
The degree you hold should be somehow related to the animal studies or science. These might include biology, chemistry and animal husbandry. A Bachelors degree is preferred, but some seeking to enter the field of pharmaceutical reps go for a graduate degree to increase their chances of getting hired.;
,


Knowing how the veterinary pharmaceutical industry works, who the major players are and what they manufacture will help you in your quest to find employment in this field., You should also understand the relationship between drugs and common diseases.

,


Organize yourself so that any question you are asked when you are in the field can be answered without having to reply to a request with the term ""Let me make a call and get back to you on that.""

,


Even if you have never had a job in the pharmaceutical industry, you can still sell yourself on your resume. People skills, sales skills, working with animals, organization, initiative and drive are what companies are looking for.
Go to seminars, meetings and conferences that relate to the animal pharmaceutical field and list these on your resume.

,


Many times these people are going to know of openings in the field long before these jobs are advertised.
Join online social groups that are related to the career you are seeking.

,


The American Association of Pharmaceutical Sales Professionals offers a pharmaceutical sales certification process and, although this is not specific for the animal pharmaceutical field, it shows you have proficiency in pharmaceutical sales skills, marketing and medical knowledge.

Talk less and listen more.,
Know your faults and work to fix them.,
Choose wisely and carefully.,
Strive to see your customers as your partners.,
Make success your habit.,
Face your failures unafraid, and learn from them.",How to Have a Successful Sales Career," The saying âfirst impression is the last impressionâ is really appropriate for salespeople. Donât blabber about your services and products; rather listen to what the customer has to say to you. Once the customer is finished talking, you'll have a good chance to present yourself and your brand as a saviour for the trouble they are facing. Always keep in mind, selling is not just giving away product; itâs more about building relationships that lead to sales. When you know about the trouble that the customer is facing, and the customer knows that you have a solution for it, then itâs a win-win situation. Thatâs what successful sales are all about.;
, If you think that others are able to sell goods while you are not, then there must be something which you are doing wrong. Never feel shy to ask others about what it is that they are doing differently; they will likely be flattered and be happy to provide advice. Analyse those things, learn from them and start to implement these newly-learned skills in your work. Always remain open to changes in your approach. Learning is a never-ending process. Remember to keep your eyes and ears open all the time to grasp even the smallest things that your successful competitors are doing well.

, Zig Ziglar once said that every choice you make has an end result. This includes choices about your sales. Consider your sales career as a snakes and ladders game, in which the snakes can appear from anywhere. You shouldn't get scared by these snakes. Rather, keep looking for ladders that can propel your career. Once you get into the knack of making the right decisions at the right times, success is bound to follow you.

, Selling is a two-way barter, between you and the client. The most prominent difference between a successful salesperson and the not so successful ones is their attitude towards their customers. While the top performers look to help the customers, the poor performers are just looking to achieve their their sales targets and move on. If you look at your customer as a mere deal, then you are going to remain mediocre like all the other people in the market. If you want to be the alpha male (or female) in the herd, then you must stop selling and start helping. A successful sales career is just like a relationship, which requires nurturing for its development. With a little understanding of customer behavior and market requirements, you may eventually be amongst best in the business. Remember, after-sales care is just as important as before-sales talk.

, Ask any successful person the question ""What made you succeed?"", and you will get the same reply: they thought of succeeding without being deterred from failure, and made it a habit to win, no matter what the situation would be. In other words, to succeed, you need to make success a state of mind. And, once you are into the right frame of mind, success comes naturally. If experts are to be believed, then success is nothing other than a state of mind.

, ""Look up to the sky, youâll never find rainbows if youâre looking down."" â these are the words of Charlie Chaplin. And fit perfectly to people looking to give their career a boost. Failures are bound to come when you are trying something, but getting deterred from those failures and giving in is something that losers do. To climb the ladder of success you need to stand up and face those failures. Learn from the mistakes that you make, every time you fail; and convert them into strength. With a little effort, you can eventually touch the sky and pave way for a successful career. Never give up trying.

By taking classes in these subjects, you will gain the knowledge you'll need to help your athletes improve.


Your chances of being hired and paid well in this position will be higher if you hold an associate's or bachelor's degree in one of these or in a related field.

, If you want to work at a high level and make a larger salary, your employer might require certification as a strength and conditioning coach. However, if the position you are trying to attain does not specifically request certification, you may be able to skip it.

, Although there are many agencies for certifying strength and conditioning coaches, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) is the most widely respected of these., The National Strength and Conditioning Association's exam costs $260 for NSCA members, and $445 for non-members. Make room for the exam in your budget.

, Look up what information will be cover in your agency of choice's test. Study the format of the exam as well âÂ will it be entirely multiple choice, or do you need to brush up your essay-writing skills?


If you took classes in college relevant to the exam, look at your old class notes to refresh the information in your mind.
Most reputable certification agencies will provide study materials for people studying to take the exam. Avail yourself of those resources.

, An elementary-aged athleteâs body is very different from a high school-aged athleteâs body, and you cannot treat every age group with the same blanket approach to exercise.With young children (6-11 years old), be aware that girls will develop motor skills at an earlier age than boys.
With children, plan activities that will help young athletes develop basic motor skills like jumping, throwing, catching, skipping, climbing, etc., rather than focusing on the specialized motions of the specific sport youâre preparing them for. Older athletes should be encouraged to develop more complex skills like speed, agility, and flexibility.

, Remember to address all the major muscle groups, including calf muscles, hamstrings, quadriceps, shoulders, etc., You cannot use a generic, blanket approach to all athletes. Each sport â and sometimes, each position within a sport â will require athletes to develop specialized skill sets. Make sure you understand the needs of your particular athletes before beginning a training program with them. For example, goalies in ice hockey and catchers in baseball spend much of their time squatting. Their strength and conditioning needs will be very different from a marathon runner, whose needs will be very different from a football running back whose position calls for quick bursts of speed and the agility to make sharp cuts.

, Yoga is a terrific way to strengthen core muscles, as are sit-ups and crunches, low back extensions, Supermans, and exercises with kettle bells. You should also consider activities that will benefit players of specific sports; for example, basketball players will benefit from passing a medicine ball back and forth, while taking golf swings while balanced on one leg will help golfers., Though athletes in all sports should work on their upper bodies, some sports âÂ gymnastics, for example â specifically require a great deal of upper body strength. Bicep curls, push-ups, tricep push-ups, pull-ups, and rope climbing are all good exercises for arm strength.

, If their legs can't support them, athletes will be hard-pressed to win in a competitive setting. Running, either on a track or on a treadmill, not only develops long muscle in athletes' legs, but it also improves their cardiovascular health and endurance, allowing them to perform at a high level without tiring for longer amounts of time. To add power for athletes whose sports require it specifically, leg exercise routines should include squats, leg presses, lunges, and vertical jumps.

, These exercises are meant to maintain, rather than increase, muscle mass.


Have your athletes hold each position for a set amount of time; consider their injury and physical ability, and use your discretion in determining the duration of the hold. Add at least 10 seconds onto their best time every two weeks to improve form.

, As a strength and conditioning coach, you will serve in many capacities: teacher, leader, motivator, and support system for the athletes under your guidance. Because you will see your athletes through a wide variety of experiences, you need to be able to adjust your approach from context to context, from day to day.

, Although your athletes will likely be socialized to accept orders from coaches unquestioningly, there may be situations in which you have to alter the manner in which you deliver your message, depending on the emotional state of your audience in that context. Your goal as a coach is not to domineer, but to get the best possible results out of your athletes. This may mean that you have to change the delivery of your message from âan orderâ to âadvice.â

, Ethos is credibility: speak from a place of authority. Most of your communication will be ethically charged orders and commands. Logos is a logical approach: perhaps an athlete feels like giving up because he or she is having a bad day. Reason with them. Instead of speaking from authority, help them understand how logical it is to work through their bad days to reach their goals. Pathos is an emotional approach: on your athletes' worst days, youâll have to work hard to understand how theyâre feeling and help them change negative emotions into positive mindsets.

Start by filming some game footage.,
Keep a record of all your stats, awards, and accomplishments.,
Pick a few colleges or universities that have the sport you are interested in and that you would like to attend and check their website or call the athletic director and find out some info.,
Finish your season strong and avoid injuries.,
If you have heard back from any coaches or an athletic director from a school you have shown interest in, send in some game footage and a summary of your stats and athletic career.,
If a coach invites you to try outs or to come practice with the team one day, make sure that you are in decent shape.,
The level of play from high school to college is tremendously greater.,
Once you have been offered a scholarship or asked to play for the following year, you and your coach should set up an official signing date.,
As the end of your senior year approaches, don't suffer from ""senior-itis."",
The next thing you will need to do is talk to your guidance office about the NCAA Clearinghouse.,
During the summer, most coaches will send you some sort of summer work out plan, or you might even leave for school early to have some sort of pre-season or ""two-a-day"" work outs.",How to Become a College Athlete," Some sports have an early fall season, such as women's soccer, and by the time a collegiate team is ready for try-outs and to start scouting a few players, your season may have ended. Game footage will play a large role in continuing your athletic career.;
, Like game footage, this will also be another factor that can help improve your chances of being looked at by a scout or being asked to come to open try-outs.

, Most schools will have some type of Athletic Questionnaire you can fill out to let them know you are interested in possibly playing there.

, A bad-timed injury at the end of your season could strongly affect your chances of being able to play in college. If a coach thinks you are injury prone, they may not be willing to take that risk with their scholarship money.

, Include as much as possible that might put you over the edge against another player being considered.

, It may be 3 months after your season has ended and you haven't touched a ball or ran a foot since your last game. Run a few extra miles and work on some touches or work on getting familiar with the skills again so you are not left looking like an amateur at the try out.

, In any sport, the game is more fast-paced, more skilled, and more competitive. It is completely different. Don't let that affect your game. You have made it to try-outs or farther, so the coaches obviously see something they can use. You deserve to be there based on your skills and ability of play.

, This is where you will sign your intent to play your college career with the school. This is usually a big day with lots of photographs so dress nice and bring your parents along.

, Don't let your grades or attendance slack off. Your athletic scholarship is pending on your grades and graduation of high school.

, All athletes that play any sport after high school must be cleared. They will give you the website address and possibly a code for your school. You will need to have good grades and attendance and a good standing to be cleared.

, Most importantly, keep in shape. You will work harder than you ever did in high school so you need to prepare your body for the physical intensity that will be new to you.

While state boxing promoter license applications vary, many require that the promoter provide information about their business entity and complete names and contact information for the business itself and its board members or partners.Promoters may be asked about their business' financial history including recent bankruptcy filings and financial interest in any boxing contestants.
A promoter's license application may also request information about the promoter's involvement in any investigations regarding event promotions or if the promoter has any history of criminal convictions.

, In most states you will need to pay a small fee when you submit your initial application. This fee is for processing the application itself, and is usually about $50.


If your application is granted, you may be required to pay a substantially larger fee for the license. In Nevada, this fee is $500.In Minnesota, it's $700., Wait for commission to approve your application. In most cases, you will be notified by mail as to their decisions.


In some states, such as Nevada, you are required to attend a hearing by the commission on the day your application is discussed to answer any questions they may have that are not covered on the application."

Find an adequate venue.,
Obtain equipment.,
Find participants.,
Obtain necessary insurance and bonds.,
Apply for an event permit.,
Hire staff.,
Advertise your event.",How to Become a Boxing Promoter2," Once you are licensed as boxing promoter, it's time to start preparing for your first event. One of the first things you'll need to do is find a place to host it. Local bars, clubs, and community centers are often ideal choices.In choosing a venue consider it's capacity. You don't want to rent a place that's too small and will not be able to fit everyone who wants to attend your event. On the other hand, a smaller venue can create the illusion of a packed house with a smaller crowd.
You will need adequate space for a regulation sized boxing ring. The size depends on nature of the event (e.g. amateur v. professional, weight class, and so on). Amateur rings are typically 16 to 20 square feet, while professional ones are 18 to 24 square feet.Your venue will also need to include dressing rooms for participants and medics, and ideally for officials as well. It will also need to include an area that the boxers can use to warm up., In addition to the venue, there is standard equipment you'll need to obtain prior to the event. This includes:The ring itself.
At least four sets of regulation competition gloves. Boxers are typically not allowed to provide their own gloves.
Protective headgear.
Tables and chairs for judges.
Stools and spit buckets for each corner.
A bell, a timer, and weigh scales.

, The person who recruits participants for a match is called the ""matchmaker."" Some promoters do this themselves, while others opt to hire a professional matchmaker.If you opt to hire a matchmaker, you can visit the BoxRec website to find a database listing licensed professionals.If you are playing this role yourself, contact a boxing club such as Golden Gloves to learn about boxers in your area who would be a good match., There are also legal requirements you'll need to satisfy prior to the event. Most states will require that you have both insurance for the event and one or more surety bonds.An insurance policy will be required to cover your liability in case someone is seriously hurt or killed during the match. Depending on the state, it is not unusual for for the law to require policies covering $10,000 in both medical expenses and life insurance.A surety bond is a bond you purchase to ensure that any payment you are required to make to the state (in the form of taxes) will be covered in the event that you default on your payment or violate state regulations. These bonds may be $10,000 or more, depending on the state., In addition to your own license, in many cases you also need a separate event permit for your match. The boxing commission in your state will have applications for these permits.


These permits will vary from state to state, but will typically require you to provide information about the date, time, and location of the event, details about the boxers (sometimes including weigh-ins and medical history), information about yourself and your business, details about your insurance, bonds, and safety equipment on the premises, and so on., A boxing event also requires you to have a range of staff on hand. You'll typically need to hire people to fill the following roles:Ringside physician (the association of ringside physicians can help you get in contact with someone)DJ/MC/Announcer
Security
Referee
Judges
Note that is common for boxing commissions to require that judges and referees be certified or examined by the commission.

, Let people know about your event and where they can buy tickets. There many ways to do this including:Social media
Flyers and posters
Contacting local media for coverage or advertising

"
"
Prepare the venue.,
Have a pre-fight meeting.,
Start on time.,
Submit necessary records and receipts.",How to Become a Boxing Promoter3," The day of the event, go to the venue before the event and make sure everything is set up as it should be. Specifically:Ensure that the ring has been constructed and complies with regulations. It may be inspected by boxing commission representatives.
Make sure all necessary equipment is where it should be.
Make sure seating is adequate for the number of tickets sold and doesn't exceed the legal capacity of the venue
Station ambulance crews in an area where they will be able to quickly access the ring if necessary, but won't be in the way

, In some states, members of the boxing commission will require the fighters and referee to meet with a representative of the department to go over the rules.Make sure the fighters and referees know when to show up for this meeting.

, Make sure your event starts on time. This is not just good promotional practice, in some places, it's the law.


In Minnesota, for example, any delay in start time must be approved by an Office of Combative Sports representative. Otherwise, the event is automatically in violation of regulations., After the match is over, provide the state boxing commission with records of ticket sales and profits following the event so that they (or you) can calculate the amount of tax you will need to pay for the event.


Pay taxes as necessary. Depending on the state you live in, it is typical for promoters to be required to pay a certain percentage of money from ticket sales in taxes. In some states, if profits exceed a specific amount, additional taxes may be levied."

Contact the league in which you want to coach.,
Be good with children.,
Make it fun.",How to Become a Sports Coach1," Whether itâs soccer, basketball, baseball, or some other childrenâs sport, you will need to be vetted by the leagueâs administration. Coaches will need to be able to pass a background check, have an interview with the administration, and be willing to have the administration interview others about your qualifications and interest.Youâll need reliable transportation so you can be sure to get to games.
You should have some basic knowledge of the sport and its rules.
Think carefully about whether you want to coach your own children, or whether it would be better to be in a position of authority over children you donât know.;
, If you are not comfortable with children, this is not the job for you. But if you love working with kids and like sports, this could be a wonderful position for you. Having rapport with children is even more important than any sports or coaching knowledge you may have.Be able to communicate well with children -- youâre going to need to keep them under control and direct them.
Be patient. Children often need a lot of practice and explanation to get to a point where they can play a sport adequately. Be ready to explain things over and over.
Have a sense of humor. Anything involving children requires an ability to be flexible and find the humor in a situation. Kids also tend to respond well to jokes and humor.

, Coaching children is about introducing them to the sport, helping them make exercise a habit, learning teamwork, and having fun doing all of it. If youâre a person who loves to win, coaching children is probably not a good fit. With kids, itâs about the journey toward becoming a team and playing the game, not the final results.Drills should be structured to be fun, challenging, and teach the children a skill
Team bonding should be an important part of your work -- have a snack and drink rotation, and a party planned for the end regardless of how the games go.

Get the education to become a teacher.,
Choose the sport or sports that you want to coach.,
Get certified.,
Volunteer.,
Hone your coaching skills.,
Get a job as a coach.",How to Become a Sports Coach2," Most middle and high school coaches are also teachers at the school. To become a teacher, you will need a Bachelorâs degree and teaching certification. If you want to focus particularly on sports and exercise, getting a degree in Physical Education might be a good choice for you. This would set you up to coach and to teach any of the health courses your school might have., It doesn't have to be a sport you're especially good at, but it should definitely be a sport you are very passionate about. You need to have a strong command of the techniques necessary to succeed in the sport, the rules of the game, and a capacity to design drills and exercises that can help your team advance.

, Most sports have a governing body that will issue certifications to coaches. Check on the sport or sports of your choice to see what the specifics are. All certifications, however, will include a background check, questions about your experience playing or coaching your sport or sports, and knowledge of the sport or sports., It's best to become an assistant coach before you do the real thing, so that you will have experience and know what to expect as a coach. Try to volunteer for the sport and the level that you hope to coach. As school budgets decline, many schools are in desperate need of volunteer coaches and assistants., Observe coaches around you to see what their technique is. Learn the best ways to model and explain how you want your players to perform. Work on your responses to typical player issues, including technique, performance anxiety, or teamwork. Consider supplementing what you already know with online courses from the National Federation of State High School Associations, which offers classes specifically for coaches here: http://nfhslearn.com/


How do you want to talk to and treat your team to get them to perform their best?
What kinds of drills work best to get your team to play the way you want them to?
Think about a coach that has inspired you. How did he or she act to inspire you to be a better player?
Are you going to be a hands-on coach, and model the techniques you want, or will you be on the sidelines, explaining what you want to your team?
What is your philosophy of coaching?

, Hopefully you will be able to get a job as a teacher and be able to coach the team of your choice. Keep in mind, however, that it might take a while. You could end up with a teaching job and no coaching job. This would mean that you should continue to volunteer to keep up your coaching skills.

"
"
Get a degree.,
Get experience.,
Network.,
Apply for any jobs.",How to Become a Sports Coach3," Any college coaching job is going to require a Bachelorâs degree at minimum. Many coaches have degrees in P.E. or Leisure Studies. Within the structure of college sports, the top-tier sports schools are probably only going to require a B.A., but with lots of coaching and playing experience. The lower-tier schools are going to require more education -- typically at least a Masterâs degree, sometimes even a Ph.D. -- because you will be asked to teach college-level courses in addition to coaching. At the top level, you will just be coaching, so the educational requirements are less, but the other parts of your resume are more important., To be a top college coach, you need to have experience as a player and as a coach. It would be best if you had college playing experience, which shows that you were competitive on a high level. To get experience coaching, you might have to start out volunteering (as was the case with middle and high school). If becoming a college coach is your goal, start working on your coaching skills early -- volunteer to coach elementary school children while in high school or college, work as an assistant to a high school coach while in college, etc. Many coaches also volunteer at their own program after they have graduated so that they can gain experience at the college level., A big part of getting a job as a college coach is who you know. Go to camps, introduce yourself to people, reach out to people you want to know on email -- create your own network. People are going to be more likely to hire someone they know and have seen over the years than someone who is unknown to them. You need to promote yourself, but in a way that doesnât come off as obnoxious. Show that you really know your stuff, and make sure people know. Each sport has a governing body that hosts events around the country, including games, clinics, camps, and conventions. Make sure that you are a member of your sports organization and plan to attend a few national or regional events a year to meet people.Introduce yourself to people you admire. Tell them how much you like their work -- you might want to use a specific example: âI have been a fan of yours for years. The way your team came back from half time in that qualifying match in 2005 was nothing short of amazing!â
Get groups together for meals. Sometimes the best interactions at a conference or clinic come over meals. Invite people that you know and people you meet there to join you for lunch or dinner to have more in-depth conversations and help them network as well. Itâs going to be for everyoneâs benefit.
Make your information readily available to those you meet -- you might want to have business cards, or become part of an online business network.

, Getting a job as a college coach is incredibly competitive. It might be years and years before youâre actually hired, so be ready for a long-term job hunt. Make sure that you are coaching (even if in a volunteer capacity) at the college level while you work at a non-coaching job and search for coaching work. Keep coaching, applying, and networking, and eventually youâll find a job.

"
"
Get college coaching experience.,
Keep networking.,
Keep learning and coaching.",How to Become a Sports Coach4," Follow the steps to work as a college coach. Get the education, experience (both coaching and playing) that make it possible to coach at the highest levels. Making it to the professional level can often be a question of luck., If you want to work on the professional level, do the same kind of work you did to get a college job, but with the pros. Focus on the events held by the national professional organization. Go to events, introduce yourself to people in professional teams and organizations, and keep up your skills. When an opening appears in the organization where you want to work, make sure that all the relevant people know you -- this means doing the hard networking before a job even appears. Go to meetings of the coachesâ association of your particular sport.


Go to more experienced coaches for advice. Most of us like giving advice, and itâs a good way to have a positive interaction with other coaches. Introduce yourself to the coach (if you donât already know him or her) and ask for a piece of advice: âHow were you able to get your playersâ serves over 100 mph? I am having trouble getting them above 90, and I wondered if there was a conditioning drill that might help.â
Congratulate a coach that is doing well. âI am so impressed with your team this year -- they are so young but you have really brought out the best in them. What is your secret?â
Talk about sports. Ask them what they think about the college level of the sport they coach. âWho do you think will win the Rose Bowl this year? I donât know if Alabama or Stanford is the better team.â

, Coaching an outstanding college team can be a great way to get the attention of professional organizations. Show that you are able to help your team to perform at the highest levels year after year. By being the best coach you can be, you can show the professional organizations your potential.

Do well away from the field.",How to Be a Good Team Captain," The most important part of being a captain is leading by example. Because you are the captain, your teammates will look up to you and follow your lead whether you want them to or not. No matter the situation, your teammates need to see you working as hard as you can to win the game; you are also the primary person who will either be rewarded for credit or criticised for the team's performance.Some ways to show your effort include not jogging when you should be running, and never giving up on a play. If you slack off, or give less effort, that is a sign that they do not need to try as hard either.
This is especially important if you are losing during a game. Donât let the situation dictate your effort. Let your teammates know that you will always give your best effort, even if you donât win the game. It can be hard to keep that energy up while losing, and your teammates will need your example to help.;
, On the field, you should treat your opponents with respect. After the game is over, be sure to shake their hands as well. No matter how contentious the game, congratulate them on a good contest. Let your teammates know it is okay and important to be respectful of the everyone playing.Be respectful to fans. You can always lead your teammates in saluting or applauding the cheers of your own fans after the game. Ignore booing, taunts, or insults to show your teammates that those things shouldnât affect their performance. Never shout back or make obscene gestures in response to negative fan comments.
Talk to your teammates about sportsmanship as well. Ask them to describe what they think sportsmanship means, and how they are going to practice it during games. That way they will know and understand what you are doing, rather than you hoping they pick it up. It never hurts to remind them of the proper way to treat each other and their opponents.

, In many sports, captains are the only players allowed to talk to the referees. Donât shout at the officials over calls you think they missed or got wrong. Remember that the referee is in charge on the field, and that you canât let their calls affect your play on the field.Donât be afraid to discuss calls with the referees. Just remember to do so respectfully. Asking why something was or was not a foul, and explaining why you thought otherwise, is much better than trying to argue that the referee was wrong. Ask âWhy was that a foul?â and listen to the answer rather than more accusatory statements like âThatâs a terrible callâ or âYou didnât call that foul on the other team.â
In some sports, the referees will share certain rules with the captains that players should be aware of. Make sure you share these rules with your teammates and coaches to make sure everyone has an idea of how the official plans to call the game.
In most sports, abusing the officials is a good way to pick up a penalty, or get yourself thrown out of the game. Not only will you be setting a bad example, but you will also be directly hurting the team.

, Part of leading by example is letting your teammates know it is important to own up to your errors. Donât make excuses when things go wrong. If appropriate, apologize. Stand up and say, âI made a mistake there. Sorry everyone.â If you are not willing to accept responsibility, your teammates wonât have any reason to do the same.


This is another piece of dealing with officials. If your teammates see you complaining about calls, it gives them an excuse to say the referee is the reason you are losing the game, rather than take responsibility for not playing well.Remember that this is for your mistakes only. It is not the captainâs job to accept responsibility for teammatesâ mistakes. If you are always trying to take the blame, your teammates wonât be able to take responsibility for their own errors., Donât let your teammates believe they canât win or be successful. Encourage your teammates after they make a mistake, let them know you believe things will go well.This doesnât have to be a big speech like youâre in a sports movie. Simple encouraging phrases like âLetâs go!â or âWe can do this!â can be helpful letting the team know you believe you can play well and win.
This can be especially important if your teammate has been chewed out by the coach for a mistake. Piling on wonât help, so help pick him up. Let him know he can improve and that you believe he will do better the next time. A simple pat on the back and telling your teammate âItâll be alright, youâll get them next timeâ is a friendly reminder that you and the team supports him.
Body language matters. Donât do things like shrug your shoulders or throw your arms up in the air if a teammate makes a mistake. Even without saying anything, these kinds of gestures communicate negative feelings, and send a bad message to your teammates., As a leader, you want your teammates to know that they can talk to you about the team, their performance, or how the season is going.


Encourage your teammates to talk to one another as well. Show them that itâs important to appreciate good effort, even with high-fives and a simple âWay to go!âWhen facing a tough situation, like a player who doesnât respond well to criticism or someone who is causing trouble, find ways to talk to them away from the rest of the team. Ask about his concerns and let him know how what he is doing hurts himself and team. Remember to be firm and consistent, and remind him that actions that hurt the team canât be tolerated.Remember that, on the field, you are in charge. If youâve decided how something should be done, communicate that quickly and confidently. Tell them âThis is what we are doing,â and don't be afraid to explain your decisions. The more consistent you can be in explaining what you want to do will help your teammates trust and follow you.
The team probably won't like every decision you make. That is one of the tough parts about being a leader. If they know they can trust you, it will be easier to accept your choices, even if they disagree or it doesnât work out.
Make sure you listen to your teammatesâ suggestions for improvement as well. This lets them know that you value their opinion, and can take advice as well as give it. Besides, you know that your game can always improve.

, As a leader, your job is not just to tell your teammates what to do, but help them get there. Be willing to offer advice before and during practice to help everyone improve performance.You donât want this to be too accusatory, saying things like âYouâre doing it wrong.â Try to be more suggestive, saying things like âWhy donât you try this,â or âJust remember to do this one other thing when you make this move.â
This means talking to your fellow captains too. Lots of teams have more than one captain, so you need to be willing to work with your fellow captains to make sure you are all on the same page.

, As a team leader, you need to be willing to set goals for your team to achieve. Look for personal and team milestones that you all can accomplish together. Concrete objectives can be great for keeping everyone focused on the same thing.Work with your coach to help create these goals. You want to make sure they are consistent with your coachâs vision for how the team should be run and the success you have.

, As a team leader, you know that practice is just as important as the game. Just like in games, you need to be willing to work hard to show your teammates that itâs important. Compete in every drill or practice session, and force your teammates to work hard to beat you., If you expect your teammates to follow your example, make sure you are the kind of person they want to follow. Stop rumors and gossip, and look for ways to encourage your teammates at all times.You need to be familiar with all of your teammates, including the best ways to motivate them. Not everyone responds to motivation the same way, so youâll need to know the best ways to motivate and encourage each of them individually.
Avoid team cliques. You are part of a team made up of players, not a team made up of teams. You wonât be able to make everyone friends, but you should be willing to break up groups that exclude other members.
If you have personal issues with a teammate, it is always better to discuss them in private. You want to avoid calling out teammates in public, which can cause embarrassment, and make the disagreements worse.

, While the coach is in charge of the team, he canât be everywhere at once, and will probably need your help. If you notice someone who needs help, offer it rather than waiting for the coach to notice. If it is time for practice to start, and your coach is doing something else, set up some stretching or a drill to make sure you are doing something productive.If you notice problems developing in teammateâs habits or their level of play that the coach canât solve, call a playerâs-only meeting to help one another discuss issues without the coach looking over everyone., Your team will work better when you are happy together. Find ways to build team spirit and encourage your teammates to interact with one another away from practices and games.Some good ways include holding a team dinner or party, making a team motto and even printing up shirts with it, or maybe creating a silly postgame tradition to recognize good performances. Even just briefly talking to your teammates when you run into them outside of practice or the game can help make them feel more like a part of the team.
Many teams will have more naturally outgoing players that like organizing social events and other morale-boosters. It is okay to let someone else be the unofficial (or official) âsocial coordinatorâ as long as you support them and make sure the whole team is included.
Not everyone on the team will be best friends, but doing social events together will help you all learn more about each other, and remind everyone of the importance of the team.

, As a captain, you are not only the teamâs leader, but one of its representatives to the rest of the community. Acting appropriately looks good for your team, and sets a good example for your teammates as well.If you play for a school team, this means doing well in your classes and staying out of trouble. In most high schools and colleges, you wonât be able to compete if your grades are poor, so make sure you and your teammates stay eligible. Set a good example for your teammates by getting the best grades you can, encouraging success on and off the field.
If you are a professional athlete, avoid getting into legal trouble. As a captain you are one of the teamâs most important public faces, and getting arrested or suspended is bad for your, and the teamâs, image. It can also prevent you from playing, which doesnât help your team at all.
Whatever level or organization you play at, be careful about material you post on social media accounts. Keep your comments positive, both to your teammates and your opponents.

Keep your mouth closed and smile.",How to Be Mentally Tough in Sports," One deep breath will help you relax, feel calmer, stay composed, reestablish your focus, see clearer and slow down what is happening around you in that moment so you can get a handle on how you want to respond. (An athlete will often take short or shallow breaths when he or she feels stress or anxiety, and thereby will have less oxygen going to the lungs which slows the body and brain down.);
, This will fuel your desire to play and your devotion to the game. (When an athlete is only thinking about why he or she doesn't like the sport, that athlete will begin to feel emotionally and physically drained.)

, You play big when you believe you have something to offer to serve the greater good and help your team succeed. (Too many athletes think that if they are not the stars of the team, they have nothing to offer. And when they do this, they begin to withdraw and pull back from participating and putting forth their best effort.)

, You want to ask questions about things you have control over and that put you in a positive and productive state of mind: what are my strengths? what can I do today to get better? how can I improve my focus? how do I visualize success? what am I grateful for? (An athlete needs to be careful not to ask questions that he or she has no control over and puts the athlete in a negative state of mind:why is the weather so bad? why do the refs call more fouls on my team? why is the coach not putting me in the game?)

, Positive expectations trigger positive beliefs about yourself and lay the foundation for positive behaviors on the field or court. (If an athlete has negative or low expectations, he or she will play to those expectations and under perform.)

, No matter what happens in a practice or game, just smile. (If a ref makes a call that you don't agree with, you look straight at the ref, keep your mouth closed and smile, and say to yourself -""no problem"" or ""it's ok"". Then you briefly nod your head, turn around and as you are walking away you tell yourself - ""we need these refs to keep control of the game"".)

, Every once in a while, cheer on your team, even if nobody else is. It is like electricity. You be the conductor for the ""electricity"" to pass through. It's infectious. Especially after a great play like a buzzer-beater or grand slam. Just shout out ""Let's go guys"" or ""Pick it up guys"". Don't ever be afraid to do so. Just don't go overboard! That may tick your teammates off!

, Don't slack off because you see others doing it. Being successful means doing above and beyond what you are told.

Competitive skill, natural athletic ability, and other talents are the seed from which championships grow, but they need to be watered with intelligent focus and hard training. You can't hop straight into the NBA or get hired on as a CEO for a tech company without identifying your talents and training to improve them.;
, An athlete who is not gifted with blazing speed can make up for it by increasing their agility, strength, jumping ability, or strategy, but it's important to be honest. If you're an intelligent soccer player, you won't develop an attachment for playing striker if your shot is inaccurate, but your defending skills are top-notch.

, Explore lots of competitive and non-competitive fields to see where you might be great. Diversify your talents and find your expertise.


Maybe you've idolized LeBron James since childhood and can't get it out of your head to be a professional basketball champion, just like him. If you can't shoot your way out of a cardboard box and stumble on your own feet when you try to shoot a lay-up, that might be hard. But maybe you're built like Dick Butkus, or you can do the quadratic formula in your headâmaybe you were destined for greatness in some other field.
Play lots of different sports, even if you're worried you won't be good. If you love football, try out volleyball to develop hand-eye-coordination and see if your skills translate. If you love playing tennis, try out a team sport like soccer to see if you don't enjoy playing a role in a group of champions.

, Approach every new field of play with the desire to be great at it, with the expectation you will master it. When you're learning how to cook, when you're learning how to drive a manual transmission vehicle, when you're learning to speak German, treat it like you're walking onto the field of competition and that you'll come out champion.

, If you've narrowed in on a set of skills and natural abilities, what is your ultimate goal? What will make you a champion? What will make you satisfied? Set a goal in mind and start yourself in working toward it.


Being a champion is partly a list of achievements, but even more so a state of mind. Being a champion has to do with knowingâreally knowingâthat you're the best at what you do. Winning the National Book Award might be a great achievement, but does that really mean that writer is the best?
Being a champion student might mean getting your grades up to at least Bsâsomething that might've seemed impossible at one point. Maybe being a champion worker means that you show up early and stay late and can walk with the confidence that you're great at what you do. Find your championship and define the terms.

, A chess champion studies opening strategies and finds new and creative ways to defend them. A champion football player exhausts himself in the front yard doing bunny hops to improve his speed and agility, instead of playing Madden on Xbox. A champion chemist forgets to eat dinner because the new issue of Science is too compelling. A champion lives and breathes the field for which they have talent.


Study the competition and study your competitors. Professional athletes devote countless hours each week to studying film of their next week's opponents, dissecting the strategies the other team will employ, the techniques they'll use, and the abilities of the athletes. Businessmen at all levels make a point of studying the sales strategies and the product quality of their competitors as a way of improving their own.

, For every Michael Jordan there is a Phil Jackson. For every Messi a Maradona. Champions need great coaches, teachers, and motivators to keep them succeeding at a high level. If you're going to be a champion, you'll need help along the way.


Athletes should consult good exercise trainers and coaches, as well as good weightlifting trainers, fitness and rehab doctors, and often diet coaches to stay fit and healthy.
Look for coaches that you can build a relationship with on a personal level to make your training as enjoyable as possible. If you look forward to sessions with your coach, you'll be a better and more receptive student.
Learn to take negative feedback and motivate you to improve. If a coach tells you that you're doing drills like a grandmother, you could collapse and complain, or you could kick it into high gear. Even if you were working hard, is it such a bad thing to go faster? If you're a champion, you'll say no.

, If you want to be a championâto be the absolute best at what you doâit's important to devote time to training for that championship each and every day. You need to actively work on building skills, studying the game, and making yourself the best. Train like a champion and you'll be a champion.


For athletes, it's important to give equal weight to studying strategy, building fundamentals, and playing the game to have fun and learn to get better in competition. More specific instructions can be found for specifics sports below:

Basketball
Football
Soccer
Tennis
Swimming
Golf


For other fields, it's important to devote time and active effort in improving your skills. Depending on your field, this could be drastically different, but some important ways to improve your mind and your interpersonal abilities. You can learn other essential skills of the champion, translatable to all fields, below:

Networking
Self-Promotion
Self-Esteem
Public Speaking
Building Relationships



, Champions should cultivate positive thinking, confidence, and intelligence in regard to their work. Make it a priority to not only be a physically talented specimen on the field, but to be a smart worker and a reliable strategies, whatever your skill-set.


If you're an athlete, read up on biographies and strategy guides about your sport. The Art of War by Sun Tzu, a military guide, is a popular reading choice among hyper-competitive athletes. Even when you're not working on improving your physical skills, work on your competitive edge.
If you're a champion of the mind, train your body as well. Exercise can help improve memory retention, energy, and overall health, making you a better version of yourself. If you spend all day working indoors, it's especially important to get out and get moving to keep your mind fit.

, Eventually, you'll hit a wall. All champions struggle to find good reasons to get up every day, sore the day before, and hit the weight room, or head back to the office. It's hard to be great day after day. That's what real championsâthe best of the bestâfind ways to stay motivated and keep themselves one step ahead. It's an essential part of training to be a champion.Lots of champions are big fans of using motivational music to psych themselves up before big games, or even practice. Heavy music with a big beat tends to be popular among athletes, making metal, hip-hop, and dance music iPod staples. Get ""Seven Nation Army"" by the White Stripes going in your headphones and try not to hit the gym with energy and enthusiasm. It's impossible.
Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players to ever play the game, used to tape newspaper articles and quotes from opposing players that said negative things about him in his locker. Every time he got ready for practice and games, he would look over the negativity to psych himself up and light his competitive fires. If opposing players hadn't said anything negative, he would make stuff up. That's how much of a champion he was.

, Champions make self-improvement a priority, and while they might work alongside coaches, trainers, and other teachers alone the way, are driven from within to succeed, not by the opinions of others. It's important to put a system of punishment and reward in place to get yourself to champion-status.


Pact and FitLife are recent innovations in exercise motivation. By entering your fitness regimen into the system, these exercise trackers will punish you by taking money out of your account if you fail to exercise according to your initial plan.
Champions need to blow off steam more than just about anybody. Find a way to unwind after you work hard training, to keep your mind sharp and relaxed. Lots of athletes enjoy video games, music, and reading after a long day of training.

, Every time you step onto the field, whether it be the office or the playing field, you need to go in expecting that you're going to walk out having done your best and proven your worth as a champion. Visualize yourself winning and doing what will be necessary to be the best and believe that it will happen.


Eliminate mental distractions when you're competing. When you're on the field, it's not the time to worry about your partner at home, whether or not you're going to be able to score concert tickets this weekend, or where you're going to party after the game. Focus on what needs to happen to win.
To help with your confidence, you have to train effectively. When you're about to compete, it isn't the time to be wondering if you could have worked your reps in the gym better, or if you could have watched more tape of the opposing team. Train hard and you'll know that you're at your best.

, When you compete, you need to compete like a champion, which means saving absolutely nothing of yourself in the tank. All your energy, all your heart, all your soul, all your competitive fire needs to explode from you during the course of the contest. You can't be left wondering if you could have chased down that shot along the baseline a little faster, or if you could have been a little more energetic in your presentation. A champion shouldn't have to wonder.All athletes and champions of the mind have to confront exhaustion at some point. Losers pack it in, close up the shop, and cash out. Champions dig deep and find a little bit more where it seems like there shouldn't be any. Work hard in your training regimen and you'll have enough endurance and stamina to see the competition through.

, When the whistle blows and the game is over, an athlete can reveal the grace and humility of a champion, or the childish behavior of a loser, regardless of the outcome.


If you win, treat it like business as usual. It's ok to celebrate, but you should act as if you've been there before. It shouldn't be a big surprise if you expected to win in the first place. Compliment the opposition and give credit where credit is due.
If you lose, it's likely that you'll be feeling frustrated and annoyed. If you're dealing with a sore winner, too, it can make it a lot worse. Don't sling mud, make excuses, or throw a tantrum, though. Shake your head, take your licks, and look to the next contest. Learn from losses and use them to motivate yourself to improve., We've all seen the gloating self-absorbed athlete bragging after making a game-winning play, forgetting the fact that teammates were there contributing the entire game. Winning champions share the credit and praise their fellow competitors, coaches, and teammates. Even if you're feeling particularly proud of what you accomplished on the field, find something to praise about others who competed. Staying humble and showing perspective is an absolutely essential part of being a great champion.


We all like to think of ourselves and self-starters who are responsible for our own success, but try to widen perspective to see the bigger picture. Your success as a champion is dependent upon your teachers, your parents, even the people working the concessions stand, or driving the bus you use to commute are contributing to your success. Don't forget that, big shot.

, Before you compete, treat it like your responsibility to win. Take on the burden of success and decide that it will be your fault if you don't come through as the champion. Put yourself in a position to win. If you don't come through, put your name on it and stand up to the blow-back like a champion.


Only you can decide whether or not you're a success. It might be good enough for you to have made a personal best on the golf course, regardless of what Tiger Woods has to say about it.
Never throw any of your teammates, coworkers, or fellow competitors ""under the bus."" Don't call someone out for blameworthy activity, even if it's deserved. Doing so is classless, a sign of pettiness. Share in the blame, if something went wrong, and act like a champion.

, Treat every occasion as a chance to celebrate your achievement. Very competitive champions are competitive all the time. Michael Jordan was known for his ruthless games of playground pig, a kids' game. Rafael Nadal, when injured, picked up high-stakes competitive poker to keep up the competitive energy while recovering from surgery. Competing regularly is an important way to keep your competitive edge sharp. As a champion, take the time to Approach every game of checkers like the Super Bowl. Approach every day like a gift.


Take the time to celebrate your victories. In an effort to appear stoic, some champions can go too far in the opposite direction, accepting their accolades with grim solemnity. Cut loose every now and then! You're a boss!

, Champions want to align themselves with fellow champions. Don't waste your time hanging out with people who aren't willing to put in the effort and the investment into their own success. Spend time with the greats.


Strive to be part of a ""power couple,"" a couple that supports each other in mutual success. Power couples are made up of two motivated and ambitious people. Think Jay-Z and Beyonce, or Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Power couples are made of champions.
try to befriend champions from different fields than your own. It might be too difficult to be best friends with the best-ever masseuse in your town, when you're second-best. Cormac McCarthy, mega-acclaimed author, claims to never associate with other writers, preferring the company of scientists.

, Your mind and outlook have an incredible impact on your performance. All champions have positive, unstoppable attitudes that contribute to winning and staying on top. Think positively in all things and look for the best in the people around you. Seek to bring out that better quality in others and focus on the positives.


In golf, long slumps are called ""the yips,"" and have been clinically verified as a psycho-phsyical phenomenon related to receptive tasks, the sort of which are found in sports.The effect of the mind on the ability of the body to produce is profound, making positivity an important quality to cultivate in champions.

, It's important for champions to look up to winners and model themselves accordingly. How did Muhammad Ali train for big fights? How does Tom Brady like to spend his off-season? What did William Faulkner like to do for fun? Study the greats and learn everything you can about them to learn more about properly applying yourself toward your own championship.


Find role models in your own field and role models in other fields to learn unexpected pearls of wisdom. Kanye West constantly compares himself to the innovative geniuses of history in interviews: Einstein, Henry Ford, and Mozart are names he constantly drops in comparison to himself, as inspirations.
An old Buddhist saying: When you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha. Champions want to conquer their heroes. If you really look up to your track coach, who has had the state record for 25 years, make it your goal to best it. Keep working until you do.

, As you climb the ladder and continue collecting championships, try to diversify your palate of competitions. What else are you great at? Where's the next challenge? A champion constantly seeks competition in all things.


Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, and Russell Simmons are all hip-hop impresarios who've cultivated multi-million dollar business empires, though they started by just wanting to be the best MCs. Now, the impact of their various businesses on style, culture, and music is enormous. They've become champions' champions.

Win the right way.,
Donât gloat.,
Be polite to the other team.,
Compliment your opponent.,
Donât laugh at your opponent.",How to Be a Good Sport1," There are a number of things involved with winning the right way, and much of it has to do with fairness and honesty. To win the right way, you must:


Refuse to cheat
Play by the rules
Be honest about your actions and the actions of other players
Listen to the guidance and rulings of your coach and the referee;
, One of the most important things about being a good winner is not gloating or bragging when you do win. The other team is aware that you won! You donât have to rub it in.Avoid saying things like:


âHaha we won and you lost!â
âYou're terrible players, and thatâs why we wonâ
âWe kicked your buttsâ

, Remember that the other team just lost, and they need some encouragement right now. They donât need you being rude, because they already feel bad for losing.


Being kind and polite to your opponents applies at all times, including before, during, and after the game. Even if you think you'll beat them, are winning in the middle of the game, or just won, you still have to be nice.
This means no trash talking the other team, no making fun, and no telling rude or mean jokes., Part of being a good winner means appreciating your opponentsâ efforts and skills, and you can show this by complimenting them.Imagine how you'd feel if you just lost. Wouldnât you like to hear the other team say how well you played?


For instance, you can say something like, âYou guys played a great game, and I really like how well you work as a team.â
At the end of the game, whether you won or lost, you can tell your opponents âgood game!â
You can also do this in the middle of the game. If one of your opponents makes a great move or play, say something nice about it., Even though the other team lost, it doesnât mean that they're bad players, and you shouldnât make them feel like they are. And even if they lost by a lot, you should never make fun, laugh at, or make jokes about the other team or any of the players.


Instead of poking fun, you can try offering tips or suggestions that might help them improve their game."

Chapter XIII, The Use of Spies.",How to Apply the Art of War in Sports," Plan for and apply three factors for better sports teamwork and for achieving great heights rather than mediocrity.... In warfare, as in athletic competition, there are three constant factors that can determine who will be more likely to win. These are: The Moral Law (obedience), The Commander (the captain), Method and Discipline (the general disposition and organization). In applying these to the team situation of a sport, consider the following:


Apply and expect adherence to the Moral Law to gain the respect of your subordinates or teammates, and to gain their trust.
Take your Commander abilities to the next level by practicing the five virtues: wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness. Whether or not you are the captain or a team member, applying each of these virtues will aid your effectiveness.
Improve on Method and Discipline by defining clearly each team member's roles and responsibilities, including your own. For larger professional teams, this includes each person knowing their rank and being adequately recompensed. Moreover, backups and others who may or may not be brought into the game or event should be kept in the loop of everything that is happening, regardless of their chances of being involved because they may be your greatest resource when least expected and it also ensures that they don't defect.;
, ""In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns"". Sun Tzu wisely counseled in this chapter to defeat your opponent fast, so that you won't become fatigued and you won't lose your strength. This means putting forth all your best efforts to defeat your opponents, so that they lose the desire or strength to win. If you center your principal objective on beating your opponent, more than anything else, you may have an ultimate, unchallenged victory.

, The art of mastery in sports and the ability that you must practice, is the one of winning without fighting. That is: you should win without having to go to great trouble to obtain a victory, or having to break your opponent's will to win. How? You can do this with good preparation beforehand, and by using the correct strategy, such as working out when indirect approaches will be more effective and less energy-draining than direct approaches. This means knowing your sport thoroughly, learning about the tactics great players or participants in your sport have used in the years, sometimes decades, before your time in the sport, and always learning by observing during practice sessions, during games and events, and after your participation. Look for the strategies that prove most beneficial by using your intelligence and simply sheer physicality.

, ""Know your enemy and know yourself"", Sun Tzu warns. If you do so, then you will win a hundred out of a hundred battles, Sun Tzu promises. In the context of sport, this has exactly the same purpose â detailed knowledge of your opponent means that you know their habits, their vulnerabilities, and their limitations. But in order to not have this same tactic applied to you effectively, you must learn to grapple with your own vulnerabilities and know your own limitations and how to work with them, not against them. In that way, you render yourself invulnerable to the opponent's tactical positioning and attempts to dislodge you from succeeding. And knowing your limitations also means being flexible; able to change tactics when it's clear that your usual approach is failing â Sun Tzu summed this up as: ""He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain"".

, In war, this concerns directing the momentum of the army to focus its energies in the most creative and timely manner. In sport, this is the practice of visualization and pacing yourself. From the point of view of visualization, this is a powerful sporting technique that can propel you to a win through mental determination and a focus on what you know you're truly capable of. In terms of pacing yourself, this is about learning when to sprint and when to hold back so that your energy is wisely conserved. Moreover, from a team perspective, a coach or team trainer knows to encourage combined energy from all of the team so that no single member of the team is worn down. The best team is one in which all the players commit to their strengths throughout the game, as recognized and encouraged by the coach or trainer in charge.

, Again, you need to know your enemy well in order to spot their weak points, and then attack them. Or like Tzu says, imitate the rivers, that flow downside to the empty places. Moreover, being first to attack puts you in the stronger position because you lead the way according to how you have chosen (thereby imposing your will), and for your opponent, being on the back foot is much harder to recover from.

, Maneuver with intelligence. You can lead an army of 1000 soldiers the same way as one of 10 â it is only a matter of signs and communication. Establish a common language between you and your teammates and coach or trainer. Implement good communication and trust in your team. Remember that the base for a cohesive and cooperative team is clear, constant communication and mutual support.

, This point is very easy to understand â vary your tactics, and you win. As already stated above, remember that there are two attack methods: the direct and the indirect. The direct method may be used to score individual points, but indirect methods to secure victory as they're unforeseen, unexpected, and easily throw the confidence of your opponent. Be sure to disguise your intentions as best as possible, to avoid detection when you're about to vary your approach.

, As the army progresses, so too does the sportsperson as the game or event unfolds. Remember to sustain all your aims on winning throughout the game. Try to understand your opponent's strategy and destroy it, and bear in mind at all times that: ""The clever fighter imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him"". At this point, do not relax your alertness but be on the watch for the opponent's changes in tactics and counter-attacks.

, Use the best position and tactics in relation to the environment and to your opponent. Threaten your opponent's remaining valuable strategies and positioning to prevent them from connecting their weakness with their strengths. Know how to drive your opponent into a position where their weaker self is all they have left to rely upon. Where it is clear that your opponent has failed to adequately prepare for the situation, strike fast if they let open a door and attack quickly.

, Attack your opponent with fervor, especially when the game or event is vital. Be ""fast as the wind"" and as ""unmovable"" as the forest. That means that your attack must be very quick, but your game and positioning should remain very consistent. Remember that the army who wins is the one that shares the same spirit throughout all its ranks, keeping true and remaining consistent.

, Having previous knowledge of your opponent is very useful, as already outlined before. When you have the opportunity, inquire about your opponent's type of game, weaknesses and strengths from people in a position to know best; of course, with the advent of video playback and the publishing of both statistics and commentaries, you have the luxury of reviewing this information in the comfort of your home or club for many sports, something Sun Tzu didn't have available! Make the most of your sources of information to learn all that you can about your opponent. The secret of great princes and warriors that were regarded as geniuses was in actual fact principally only previous knowledge, noted diligently and well applied.

Give yourself a few moments to cool down.,
Donât quit if you aren't winning.,
Be friendly and kind to the other team.,
Congratulate your opponent.,
Avoid blaming others.,
Cheer your team on.,
Learn from your defeat.",How to Be a Good Sport2," For most people, the initial reaction to losing is disappointment, sadness, or anger. Part of being a good sport is not being a sore loser, and you can do this by giving yourself time to relax and collect yourself after a loss.


Instead of yelling, crying, complaining or storming off right after the game, sit down alone for a minute. Take some deep breaths, and try to focus on all the things you love about the game. After that, you can line up with your teammates to shake hands. If you need an extra minute, go to the back of the line.After the game when you're back home, if you still feel like something was unfair, talk to your parents or your coach.

, It can be very discouraging when you're losing in the middle of a game, but being a good sport means sticking with it and trying your hardest, even if you donât think you'll win the game.Playing a game is all about having fun, doing your best, and working to improve your skills, and you can't do this if you quit in the middle of a game.
For example, if you or another teammate makes a mistake that could cost you the game, such as missing a vital goal, you should still put in just as much effort as before.
You should also thank your teammate for trying, because everyone needs encouragement after a mistake.

, When you're feeling bad for losing, it can be easy to try to make other people feel bad too. But when you lose, being a good sport means being nice to the other team regardless.Try saying something like, âWow, you played a great game. Any team will have a hard time beating you!â

, Both teams tried their best, and you both deserve to be congratulated! Being a good loser means not being angry with the team who won. If you do that, you can enjoy the victory they're celebrating rather than sulking about your own loss.


After the game, tell the winning team that they played a great game, and congratulate them., Being a good loser also means accepting that you lost, and not trying to blame the loss on yourself, other teammates, the referee, or anybody else.


The important thing is that you learn from the game and use that to improve in the future.At your next meeting, think of a few examples from your game that show where your team can use more practice.

, Whether you're winning, losing, or have no chance of winning, your teammates still need encouragement. You can help them feel good about their efforts by always cheering them on, telling them how well they're doing, and being positive.During the game, say things like âyou're doing great,â and, âcome on team, we can do this,â and, âwhat a fantastic play/effort/try.â
Donât get down on your teammates for making mistakes. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, including you, and nobody needs those errors pointed out.Instead, focus on what your teammates are doing right, and offer helpful suggestions about how they can improve.

, Any time you lose a game, itâs actually an opportunity to make yourself a better player and become stronger as a team. Your loss can show you weaknesses, and you can use this to your advantage by practicing extra hard on the areas where you need improvement.


For instance, if you lost a game because your team let in too many goals, then you know you have to work on your teamâs defensive skills.
On the other hand, if you lost because you weren't able to score enough, then you should work on your offensive skills.
Similarly, if your team is disorganized, you should work on drills that will improve how well you play together.
Or, if there are team members that needs help with coordination or technical skills, then work on drills and exercises that will improve abilities on the field.

Know the rules of the game.,
Play fair.,
Understand that trying your best is more important than winning.,
Give people the benefit of the doubt.,
Be respectful.,
Be a team player.,
Shake hands at the end of the game.",How to Be a Good Sport3," In order to play a game properly and fairly, you need to know the rules. The rules will tell you the object of the game, what's expected of players, and what's fair and whatâs not allowed.


For example, most field sports have boundary lines, and you need to know where these are in order to play the game properly.
If you are starting out with a new sport or hobby and donât know all the rules, ask coaches, parents, and other players. You can also read books or check websites.

, Once you know the rules of the game, itâs important that you play by them and donât cheat just to tip the odds in your favor.Donât cheat means donât bend the rules, donât lie about how events played out, and be honest about your actions and the actions of other players.For example, if you have an opportunity to score a basket in a game of basketball but can't do it without taking more steps than you're allowed without dribbling, resist the temptation to cheat. Do your best while following the rules, even if it means not scoring.

, While winning is the object of many games, itâs not the only thing thatâs important.Instead of caring only about winning, focus on things like:Learning the game
Having fun
Getting exercise
Making new friends
Improving your skills

, There will be disagreements that occur in your games, and part of being a good sport is taking peopleâs word and not suspecting others of lying and cheating.


For instance, if you think that someone went out of bounds but the other team says that player was in bounds, accept what they're saying and let the game resume.
Similarly, you can hope if the tables were turned, the other team will also give you the benefit of the doubt., This means showing respect for your coaches, yourself, your teammates, your fans, and the game officials.You can do this by listening to what these people say, taking their advice, and not arguing with them.


For instance, if your coach suggests that you try a certain play on the field, try your best to execute it, even if you think it wonât work.
You can also show respect by showing up to all your games and practices on time, even if you're the best player on the team and think you donât need to practice., Everybody on your team has something to contribute, and everyone deserves a chance to play. Even if your team is on the verge of winning or losing and you think you need an all-star lineup on the field, you must still let other players have a turn, even if they need some extra practice.


Players who do need extra practice will never get better if they aren't given a chance to play, so donât get angry or upset if your coach pulls you to give another player time on the field.Donât be a show-off, even if you're a more skilled player than your teammates or the other team., No matter what the result of the game and regardless of whether you won or lost, you should always shake hands with your own team and your opponents.Shaking hands at the end of a game is a sign of good faith, and indicates that you're more concerned with playing well, having fun, congratulating your fellow players, and encouraging your team.

Revise all internal policies and procedures.",How to Protect Your Privacy During Office Moving," You can use your own staff at the moving or hire a professional office removal service. In both cases, it's crucial that the organization which has control of the moved documents knows that it is responsible for the secure moving of all personal and confidential information from the start to the finish. While your office movers may be responsible for the mechanics of the move, they are not ultimately responsible for your documents' privacy. An adverse action by the mover thatÂ creates an opportunity for a data breach is a big problem for your office. The good news is there are professional office movers that also are in the business of records management. These ""hybrid"" movers employ trained, background checked employees that are trained in handling protected material.;
, When you move company records from one location to another, it is important to sign a formal contract or agreement with your moving company. This is even more important when these records contain confidential and personal information. Ensure that your movers fully understand their responsibilities and extra tasks after the move is complete.


For example, if your company is organizing centralization of its operation in one location, the moving company may be asked to re-sort all documents and records containing the personal information.

, When a company is moving, usually it's the perfect time to dispose of any documents that won't be needed anymore. Don't throw the documents in the garbage! Any paper or other hard copy records must be shredded or burned. It is your responsibility to destroy any confidential documentation prior to the office move.

, All documents which will be moved in the new location must be packed in sturdy boxes. Don't forget to log the contents of each box, both manually and digitally. Once all documents are packed and ready for the movement, they should be stored in a secure location with controlled access.

, If there is need for permanently destruction of electronic confidential data during the move, you should take extra precautions. Simply reformatting doesn't guarantee permanent disposal of the confidential data. There are many commercial software options to restore the erased information thoroughly. You must use special utilities and tools for permanent destruction of all data from hard disks and portable drives. Always test afterwards, to check that everything is completely erased.

, Make sure that you have booked adequate storage facilities for long term storage of your documents. They must be secured and they should have proper climate-control standards. You must be sure that these documents will be in good condition in several years.

, Ensure that all the electronic data and storage media which will be moved in the new office is logged. These logs will ensure you that nothing has been tampered with and that everything is moved properly.

, Keeping track of your documentation all the time will ensure that you won't lose any information. Worst case scenario â if something is missing â you will be able to organize the moving company to quickly locate the lost records. Assign someone to ensure that all the documents are secured all the time. Make sure that you check your logs at any point of the office relocation:


When they are loaded in the van/truck;
When they arrive at your new destination;
After they are unloaded in the new building or storage unit.

, If the worst does happen and any information is stolen by or disclosed to unauthorized parties, your company should advise every person affected by the leaked information. This will help in both averting potentially embarrassing situations and provides for the fast organization for recovering/creating new documents.

, All confidential and personal records should be moved in secured and locked trucks. It's best to separate them from the rest of the removal materials (such as furniture, equipment, supplies).

, Never leave confidential documents in an unsecured location! The first thing you should do when they arrive at the new location is to move them directly to their new secure area. Ensure that they are stored in secure location with limited access. Every entry and exit should be recorded, even if the person entering is pre-approved personnel. Privacy breaches often occur at this time, so be sure everything is under constant control.

, Ensure that all equipment for the document storage is in good order. All desks and file cabinets should have working locks. All keys must be available and checked, and accounted for.

, Be sure that every electronic storage which contains confidential data is secured and that access by unauthorized person is not possible.

, When you are moving your office, there are numerous tasks that need to be done by various service staff, such as installing telephone/internet networks, painting, furniture assembling and computer installation. These activities are often not possible before the personal records arrive. These tasks are usually done by service personnel during work hours, when the company staff can supervise them. However, there are cases when these tasks are done after work hours. If this is your case, hire extra guards or assign this job to someone from your staff, so that you can supervise all service personnel and ensure that no unauthorized person has access to any confidential information.

, Every company has operational procedures and policies for secure storage of confidential data. However, the new location you are moving in could (and probably will) be different from your former place. Ensure that you revise, update and change all policies to suit the new place."

Get your shared work area under control.",How to Organize Your Desk," Reorganizing will be easiest if you start with a blank desk. Clear everything off the top . Remove items from the drawers (if you have them). Keep everything together on a separate table or on the floor so you can go through it later. Once the initial clutter is out of the way, youâll be able to assess exactly how you want your desk to look.It will likely take much longer to go through your desk one object at a time looking for things to throw away.;
, Take advantage of your desk being clear and use the opportunity to give it a good cleaning. Dust and wipe your desktop down with a multi-surface cleaner. Treat lingering stains and polish away scratches in wooden desks. Your desk will look brand new when youâre finished.Be sure everything has been removed from the desk before you start cleaning. Otherwise, youâll have to clean around the existing clutter.

, Take the junk you removed from your desk and divide everything into two piles: one for things to throw away, and another for things you intend to keep. Be stern with your choices. Get rid of as many unimportant items as you can until your stuff has been pared down to the bare necessities. This will make it easier to keep up with everything.People often develop attachments to things they donât use that have no benefit to them. Letting go of unused belongings can bring you some much needed peace of mind once itâs done.
Donât forget to dispose of any trash you find while clearing out your desk. This can account for a large portion of the clutter., Take a look around your desk for anything thatâs no longer current. This can include outdated calendars, answered and unanswered mail and even old photos. Find fresh replacements for these objects. Throw away the out of date items or put them in storage. Everything on your desk should be new and ready to use going forward.Itâs okay to hold onto things that have sentimental value. If you have an old picture, gift or memento you want to keep, stash it away somewhere safe and keep your desk free for its intended use.

, Now that itâs time to start putting things back on your desk, donât just stick everything back where it was. Think of new ways you could reorder your desk to take advantage of the space you have. You might simply âmirrorâ your desk by putting things back on the opposite side, or choose new locations for each piece individually. Devising an engaging layout that will help you stay interested while youâre working.Rearranging the items on your desk is a small tweak that will nonetheless help break up the monotony of always seeing the same things in the same places when you sit down to work.
In China, there is an entire art devoted to changing the positioning of everyday objects. It is known as feng shui, and it has been shown to be very psychologically therapeutic., Running low on paper, ink pens or staples? Visit an office supply store and pick up some materials to replenish your desk. Take a list with you so you wonât forget the basics. Focus on things that you use a lot and tend to go through quickly. When itâs time to get to work, youâll be stocked on all the essentials.Even if your workplace provides office supplies, keeping a few of your own things on hand (such as a favorite type of pen) can make you feel more comfortable.

, Once you have an idea of how you want your new desk layout to look, position your belongings in a way that will maximize productivity while eliminating potential clutter. Reserve the center of the desk for your computer, for instance, while keeping important tools and documents within arms reach. Not only will this make it easier to work, it will also keep you from having to search for things because they will always be in the most logical spot.Your intuition will usually be your best guide for telling you where an item should go. If you instinctively look for a certain thing in a certain location, thatâs probably the best place for it to go.

, A clean, organized desk is the goal, but that doesnât mean it has to be dull. Add a few decorative touches to your desk to give it a little personality. A couple framed pictures, a small statue or a humorous coffee mug can liven up your space and make it feel more like home.If you work in a cubicle or office, bring a few items from home to combat the drab atmosphere of the workplace.
Tack up inspirational images and messages to keep you motivated to work hard., If you find yourself reaching for certain things a lot, make sure theyâre accessible. Give some thought to how frequently you reach for certain items on your desk and arrange them in order of importance. By taking this approach, you can streamline the process of finding and using various supplies.Writing utensils, typing paper, notebooks, communication devices and digital accessories might all be kept out in the open, or somewhere else that you can get to easily.
Separate pens and pencils into a cup to keep them together and ready to use without taking up too much space.
Leave paper clips and staplers near the printer or wherever you complete paperwork.
You can save as much as an hour a day by minimizing the time it takes you to hunt for things in a messy desk.

, Non-essential supplies that see a lot of use can go in drawers so that you can take them out as theyâre needed. Reserve the top drawers of your desk for larger items and things that you use often but donât necessarily need to keep out on the desktop.For instance, you might find that you use your laptop, tablet and other electronic devices more often than pen and paper for completing your work. In this case, these secondary materials can be stored away close at hand while leaving your desk clear for your electronics.
If you have a lot of smaller items, buy some desk drawer organizer trays. These fit neatly into the drawers of your desk, and are made up of compartmentalized sections that let you keep everything organized and visible in its proper place.
Make a mental priority list of where things should go in your work space. If you use an item frequently or itâs important to keep up with, leave it on your desktop. If you have a need for it every now and then, secure it in a nearby drawer. If you rarely use it or it doesnât really belong on your desk, find someplace else to keep it.

, Anything you decide to keep but donât need on hand at your desk should be stored elsewhere so that it doesnât accumulate and turn into a mess. This includes personal items, snacks and beverages and gadgets you only need on rare occasions. Written documents should go into folders and then into a filing cabinet, while other materials might need to be put away in a bottom drawer or closet if theyâre not likely to be used. Keep as much off and out of your desk as you can, except for the things that you have to have.Try to get in the habit of putting away things after youâve used them. Otherwise, they have a tendency to accumulate on your desktop, or get stuffed into a drawer that can quickly fill up with junk.

, To facilitate sorting paper documents, invest in a letter tray. These are shallow, multi-tiered containers that allow you to designate each level for incoming and outgoing paperwork, as well as answered and unanswered mail. By confining your written materials to a letter tray, folders and a filing cabinet, youâll prevent your desk space from becoming overwhelmed by loose paper.Using a paper tray, or a multiple trays for different purposes, is a simple trick that can help eliminate the majority of paper clutter on your desk.
Have one tray ready for finished/unfinished paperwork, another for incoming/outgoing mail, etc., Some people might have to make use of a communal desk or partitioned cubicle while at the office, or your desk may just be in close proximity to others, leaving you with a limited amount of room. You can still take steps to tame a shared space.


First, make sure there are clear boundaries in place to distinguish what belongs where. Then, you can begin organizing your own section to maximize order and efficiency.
Label your personal materials and keep them close to where you sit. Identify which paperwork is yours and sort it into individual file folders, and from there into drawers or paper trays.
Have a designated place for shared supplies so that extraneous clutter doesn't spill into your area.Carry a backpack or briefcase to help you keep tabs on your stuff. If you're working in a setting with shared space and storage, you might not be able to keep as many supplies and belongings on your desk or in nearby drawers.Stay on top of regular sorting and cleaning to keep a shared desk or workspace from turning into a mess. More people concentrated into the same confined area means more trash, stray papers and general disarray.

Place a piece of paper on a surface.,
Obtain manufacturer-approved oil.,
Apply the oil to the paper in a zigzag pattern.,
Turn the paper shredder on and shred the oil-covered paper.,
Add a few more papers into the shredder to absorb the excess oil.",How to Oil a Shredder1," Place a sheet of paper (letter size or A4 is best) on a surface that can be cleaned from oil. Oil may spill on this surface so make sure it cannot be damaged if it does spill., Purchase the oil recommended for your paper shredder by the manufacturer. Different shredders will use different oils and will usually sell the oil where you purchased your shredder.


If you are using an old and/or out of warranty paper shredder, you can use canola oil as a substitute rather than purchasing oil. The oil produced by some brands is actually just repackaged canola oil so you can save a little money by using canola oil., Drizzle the oil over the paper in a zigzag pattern on one side of the paper. Try not to saturate the paper or put too much oil or else it can get a little messy.


Make sure the zigzags stretch all the way from side to side to ensure sufficient coverage.

, Shred the oil-covered paper by running it through the machine. As the paper gets shredded the oil will coat the blades, which then redistribute the oil. This keeps the shredder operating smoothly.


Ensure that paper is not creased and damaged or it may cause a malfunction in the machine.

, Pass a few more pieces of paper into the shredder so that they absorb the extra oil left on the blades.

Cull your existing collection.,
Decide how you want the cards to be organized.,
Copy out a small collection.,
Store useful cards.",How to Organize Business Cards1," If youâve been in business a long time already, you might have a sizable stash of business cards that need to get organized. Before you start organizing the ones you may still find useful, save time by going through your cards and disposing of all the ones that might not be useful anymore.Get rid of business cards you donât recognize. They wonât do you any good.
Get rid of business cards that advertise defunct services or companies.
Save really nostalgic cards (e.g. the card for the restaurant where you got engaged), but set them aside.;
, You can simply put the cards in alphabetical order by name or company, if that seems most useful to you. You also might consider grouping them by event or industry, and then alphabetizing them within those parameters.Experiment until you find a system that feels right for you, then stick to it.

, If you have just a few business cards and you don't want to digitize them, itâs possible to avoid using an app to organize them. Get all their information into one place by writing out their information into a reference place youâll use.If you like using a paper address book, you can transfer your cardsâ information into that.
You can also type the information straight into the Contacts feature on your computer.

, Once youâve made sure their information is easily accessible, itâs time to figure out what to do with the business cards. The âold-fashionedâ habit of keeping useful cards, even if you just use a rubber band in your desk drawer, is a good backup for computerized information.A Rolodex is easy to add and subtract cards from, and its rotating motion makes it easy to scan through cards. However, it is big and bulky, and may add an unintentionally retro look to your desk.
A business card holder is attractive and compact, with individual clear sleeves to hold each business card. Avoid having to reorganize the whole thing every time you add a new card by leaving several empty slots in each alphabetical section.

Obtain manufacturer-approved oil.,
Set the shredder to manual mode.,
Squirt a little oil along the paper entry line.,
Run the shredder in reverse for 10-20 seconds.,
Put the shredder back to automatic mode.,
Feed a few papers into the shredder to absorb the excess oil.",How to Oil a Shredder2," Purchase the oil recommended for your paper shredder by the manufacturer. Different shredders will use different oils and will usually sell the oil where you purchased your shredder.


If you are using an old and/or out of warranty paper shredder, you can use canola oil as a substitute rather than purchasing oil. The oil produced by some brands is actually just repackaged canola oil so you can save a little money by using canola oil.

, Setting the shredder to manual mode allows you to control the direction that the blades are rotating and the length of time that they are moving. You will need this for oiling the paper.

, While the paper shredder is off, squirt a line of oil lengthwise across the paper entry. This puts oil along the entire length of the blades., Start the paper shredder in the reverse direction and keep it in motion for 10-20 seconds before stopping the blades. This way the oil is spread and redistributed around to the entire cutting assembly.

, Turn off manual mode and restart the machine in automatic mode for normal use.

, Pass at least two or three more pieces of paper into the shredder so that they absorb the extra oil left on the blades.

Make sure your digital contacts are on point.,
Pick an app.,
Consider a card scanner.,
Upload cards and contacts promptly.,
Take digital notes.,
Create a rating system.,
Arrange the contacts appropriately.",How to Organize Business Cards2," If you decide to import your business cards so they mesh seamlessly with your digital contacts, youâll want to make sure that both pools are freshly organized and updated. Before uploading your business cards, take the opportunity to examine your existing contact list and remove any outdated ones.


If you donât have a way to organize your digital contacts yet, Google Contacts is often recommended, because itâs free, reliable, and works across a variety of operating systems., There are many apps available for tablets and smartphones that will scan a business card and automatically upload its information to your contacts.You canât use the app while in the middle of an event, obviously, but you can use it in your hotel room after youâre finished networking for the day. Here are a few popular options--theyâre free or a few dollars at most:


Camcard scans physical cards and allows you to swap âe-cardsâ with other users.Worldcard automatically sorts cards, and is available in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean versions as well.ScanBizCards allows you to keep a clear version of the image after youâve noted its information., If you find yourself sorting through dozens of business cards after every event, a seperately-purchased business card scanner might make your life a bit faster. Card Scan is a popular option.However, smartphone apps can do the same job, so if youâre not working with an intimidating volume of cards, this seperate purchase might not be necessary.

, When you return from a business lunch, trade show or meeting, immediately put the business cards you received in a safe and memorable place. When you have time, grab the business cards that have piled up in your desk drawer, and import them. Try to do this on a consistent schedule--once a day or week, for example.

, Just like you write on a physical business card, you should be able to add additional notes in a business card app. Type out any information that wasn't on the card: what the cardâs owner does, what information or prospects they offered, when you met them, and so on. Be detailed: youâre not doing this on the spot, so you can take your time.


Copy your written notes out.
If youâve looked up the person since you met them, you can also expand with additional research., Organize your contacts further by reflecting on how often you expect to write to or work with them. Split them into groups: reliable business contacts, potential business contacts, and those that youâll probably never talk to again.Use a system you wonât forget so that you can categorize your contacts.


Some apps include a feature where you can make notes like this.
You could use a numbering system or a green, yellow and red stoplight system, depending on your app.

, Depending on your card or contacts app, you will have a lot of choices about the ways you can organize contacts. (You will also probably be able to tag contacts to sort them into different groups, meaning you can organize their information in many different ways.) Here are some ideas on how to put contacts in order:


Alphabetize by last name.
Categorize by alphabetical order of name or company.
City where you met.
Category of industry.

"
"
Have your own cards handy.,
Read the card when you receive it.,
Have a place to put new business cards.,
Handwrite notes.",How to Organize Business Cards3," In most cases, people donât just hand each other business cards--they trade them. Facilitate a business card swap by keeping your own cards with you in professional settings like meetings and trade shows, but also in your everyday life. You never know when youâre going to meet a new contact.


If youâre having trouble keeping your cards neat, try designating a special pocket or folder for them. A rubber band also works, in a pinch.
Never just hand over your card without asking--this can be seen as pushy.Instead, say something like âIâd really like to talk to you more about what you do. Would you like to exchange cards?â

, Examining the business card for a second or two is a good way to make note of important information about a new contact. If you struggle with remembering names, use cards as a tool to connect names to faces. The person's title is usually printed on a business card, too. This is another clue about who they are and what they do.

, If you carry a notebook or bag with you to meetings, designate a place in it for the business cards of new contacts. Or, use the second pocket on your own business card carrier to collect cards you receive.


Don't stick cards in your notes, or stuff them in a pocket. They might easily go missing, or even go through the wash.
If youâre traveling and expect to receive a lot of business cards, you can stash them in a Ziploc bag in your hotel or briefcase to keep them neat and dry.Make sure the place you put new business cards is not the place you keep your own cards. You donât want to mix them up.
Wherever you put the cards right now is not a permanent place--remember that youâll be removing and organizing them later.

, Whenever you get a new business card, write down the name of the place where you met within a few days of meeting. This way, you wonât forget. Also, jot a brief note about what you talked about. Then when you contact the person later, you can remind them of the details of your conversation.


If the card is glossy and you canât write on it with a normal pen, try sticking a post-it to the card instead.

Sort your papers.,
Remove anything that you don't immediately need from your desktop.,
Arrange any everyday items that belong on your desk so that they are within reach when you need them.,
Reorganize your drawers, with the most used objects going in the top drawers so they're readily accessible.

,
Hang up your calendar, if you can.,
Get any cords and wires neatly clipped together.,
Make your office's layout work for you.,
Hang your family photos on the wall or place them on top of your file cabinet.,
Find a home for your personal items.",How to Organize Your Office," It's easy to let paperwork pile up on your desk, but this ushers in a sense of clutter, which bogs you down. Get a filing cabinet, small paper organizer with shelves for your desk or some other type of file holder to sort your papers into. Once you're done with something, file it, shred it or throw it away. If you have to keep a document but have no use for it at the present time, put it in storage.;
, Sort pens and pencils into plastic organizers that sit on your desk or inside a drawer. Do the same for extra staples, paperclips, pushpins and other small objects. If you need extra lighting, instead of putting a lamp on your desk, get a floor lamp or place a smaller lamp on top of your file cabinet.

, Your computer monitor, keyboard and phone should be the focal points of your desk if you use them most. Keep a scratch pad close by, along with a favorite pen. Other items that are used less often, like a stapler or Rolodex, can be pushed out to the perimeter so they're still easy to access yet not cluttering the space closest to you. Make sure you still have enough space to work by hand if you don't use your computer for everything. Clean the table before leaving the office

,, Alternatively, enter meetings and events into a handheld planner, PDA or your phone.

, Bundle them up and try to hide them along the wall or behind something, then tie them up with a zip-tie or something similar. You can have your IT person help you with this if you're not sure which cord is which.

, If your desk is positioned facing a window and you know you tend to get caught up in what's going on outside, see if you can turn your desk in the opposite direction. Your file cabinet should be next to your desk so you can access files as necessary; your printer, fax or scanner should also be within reach. Getting a rolling chair can help you move about your office with ease.

, Put them where you can see them but try to avoid taking up precious desk space with pictures. You could also make one collage with all your pictures and hang that on the wall so you have fewer frames to deal with.

, You can store your cell phone in your top drawer so it's close to you in case you get a call. If you're a woman, add a hanger to a wall or the back of your door for your purse.

Be consistent.,
Have only one HTML file in a given folder.",How to Organize Files on a Website," Whether you end your files with .htm or .html doesnât matter; what matters is keeping it the same across the entire site. Of course, this is only an issue if you hand-code the site. If you are using an HTML editor such as Dreamweaver, it will automatically save the file with one extension or the other every time. You can very feasibly have many different HTML files on a server with a hodgepodge of extensions and it will work just fine. You could even use different names for the files, such as home.htm, but the point is to clean up your server and make things nice and tidy. So, rule number one is: âPick a method and stick with it."" For this article, all HTML files will be referred to as index.htm.;
, Label the file index.htm and label the folder what you want the link to be called. For instance, if you are creating a page about puppies, create a new folder called puppies in your root folder (the one where you have the main index) and create a file in that new folder called index.htm. Youâre probably asking by now, âIsnât that a lot of redundancy? I only have five pages on my site; why do I need such a detailed organizational plan?"" Glad you asked! Organization is the key to easily finding files, and arranging files this way also shaves off valuable seconds in load time. How? First, findability is maximized because we have been trained to look for files inside of folders. This is how your operating system is laid out, and for good reason, too. If you open a folder and find hundreds of non-related files, finding the right one youâre looking for will be difficult, at best. Place secondary folders inside the main folder to arrange the data into logical groups. Load time is affected, too, because browsers look for a folder first, then an index of that folder. Searching for a file named puppies.htm is non-standard, so load time is going to be fractionally longer while it deduces whether puppies is a folder or a file, and then deduces what kind of file it is. Name the folder puppies and name the file index.htm; that way your visitors will have a more pleasant experience on your site, as their load times will be lower. Plus, if you ever want to add another file that also deals with puppies, all you have to do is add another folder inside the puppies folder, name the new folder brown puppies, and, again, name the HTML file index.htm.

Separate work projects from home projects.,

Group projects with similar outcomes together.,
Set SMART goals.,
Make a list of all of your tasks.,
Identify any urgent projects.,
Find your important projects.,
Look at the projects with the highest priority in your evaluation steps.,
Know when to say âNo.â It is very important that you understand how much you can take on at any one time.,
Take effort into account.,
Compare projects by numerical data.,
Look at head-to-head comparisons.,
Create your own prioritization matrix.,
Consider all of the factors.",How to Prioritize Projects," This is one way to make two overarching categories for your goals rather quickly. It will allow you to analyze how much time you want to commit to home versus how much time you want to commit to work. This way you organize your goals overall, as well as organize your home and professional goals relative to each other.


You can include more categories â school goals for example â if applicable. You can also separate urgent from non-urgent tasks.;
, One way to make good use of your time is to do similar projects together. This allows some people to get into a flow of doing a certain task and do it for all of the projects they are working on. For example, if you are looking at making a budget for your bedroom remodel, you might go ahead and revise your overall home budget plan. From there, you could catch up on the bookkeeping youâve been avoiding at the office.


This strategy may not work for those who get burnt out by repetitive tasks and need a little more variety. If you know you would become bored and struggle with multiple budgeting projects at once, this is not the strategy for you.

, Projects are mostly started with the hopes of finishing them. There is usually some kind of personal or professional reward attached to each project, whether itâs a nice patio, a pay raise, or just a thank you. Grouping projects by their outcomes is another way to prioritize based on what you need. For example, if you are struggling financially, you can look at your list and avoid projects that cost more â such as building a new patio â while emphasizing projects that make money, such as a freelancing job.


Some projects will have more of an incentive than other projects. For instance, you may have a vacation scrapbook that you've been meaning to finish for months and, at the same time, a painting you want to do for a friend's birthday. Think about the consequences of not completing the scrapbook this weekend versus not completing the painting in time for your friend's birthday on Monday. Completing either project would be rewarding, but completing the painting so that you can present it on time and not feel guilty or disappoint your friend is likely going to be more rewarding., The SMART method is a way to evaluate your goals and make sure that they are reasonable. To use this method, write out your goal in detail, and then ask these questions:Is my goal Specific? If you have a clear goal (""I want to lose 15 lbs. by the end of May by dieting and working out five days a week"") as opposed to a vague goal (""get fit""), you will have more structure in your prioritization process. Being as specific as possible will help focus your efforts.

Is my goal Measurable? In other words, establish a way to know if youâve made progress toward, or reached, your goal. If your goal is to lose 15 lbs. in two months, you can measure this goal by weighing yourself each week and charting your progress. A measurable goal means you know exactly when you have achieved it â when you see that number on the scale.

Is my goal Attainable? Think about if you have the time and the resources to reach the goal. do you have the ability and the drive to work toward it? Both are important. In some cases, a lack of ability can be made up for with drive. You can go learn the skills needed to reach your goal. In other cases, for example a 65 year old school teacher who wishes to be an astronaut, the odds might be stacked solidly against you.

Is my goal Relevant? Ask yourself if this is something you truly want and why you want it. Will this goal be fulfilling to you as an individual? Do you truly want to become a neurologist, or is that something your family wants for you? Does this work with your other goals, such as to have a large family and travel frequently, or are they in conflict?

Is my goal Time-bound? In order to keep motivated, most of us need deadlines. You have to have a timeline for your goal if you want to measure your progress and reach your goal. It may be helpful to break up long-term goals into multiple, short-term goals. For instance, before you achieve your goal of becoming a neurologist, you'll need to pass the MCATÂ®, get into medical school, obtain a residency, etc. Plan these short-term goals with as much detail as your long-term goals, applying the SMART method to each one.

, Start out by listing out each and every project and task you need to complete in the specified time period (for instance, by the end of the work day). Don't think about how long the list is or putting anything in a specific order. Just get it all out on paper so you can begin to prioritize., Go through your list and look for anything that takes precedence over your other tasks. For instance, do you have a meeting with a client at noon and you haven't finished your presentation yet? If you don't have the presentation finished, you'll blow your chances with the client and may even damage your reputation. Any projects with a looming deadline and serious consequences should go to the top of your list., Once the urgent projects have been tackled, you'll likely want to focus on important projects, or projects with the most value. There are many ways to assess value â one way is to think about how many people this project impacts; often, the more people involved, the more important the task.Asking yourself the consequences of not completing the task by the specified time period is another good way to assess its importance, as is whether you need to complete one project before you can tackle another.


For example, if you are trying to prioritize between editing a chapter of your book or going to the store to buy a new router to fix your internet, what will happen if you don't complete each project today? How many people will be affected if you don't finish your editing versus fixing the internet? Do you need the internet to finish editing your chapter? Maybe you have a deadline to send the chapter to your agent by the end of today, but you can't do that unless you fix the internet first. Both tasks are important, but asking yourself these questions may help make it clear which you should do first.
Another consideration might be who the project is for â something that might normally be a low-priority task might become very important if it's for the CEO of the company. Finishing a project for a client is usually more important than completing internal work for yourself.
You may also want to consider cost and profit involved. When thinking of profit, it shouldn't be just about money. This could mean the project will free up time, generate money, or bring in other resources in some way. Think about what the success of each project will mean, and be sure that you are thinking about the profit in a realistic way.Consider the amount of risk involved. Though many projects may seem to have fabulous outcomes, you have to consider what you might lose if the project falls short of success. Look at all of the costs of a project â money, time, advertising, etc. This will keep your expectations grounded and lead you toward safe decisions.Rank your remaining tasks based on their importance and work your way down the list.

, The evaluations steps are a good start to deciding which projects will be top priority, but may not make the decision alone. Trust your instincts about what you do and when you do it. Re-writing your list of projects you intend to do in the order that they ranked is a good place to start., Allow yourself a certain amount of time/money/etc. for projects and stick to it. If you overextend yourself, youâll do poorly on most or all of your projects., If you have multiple important projects and you are still unable to prioritize them, think about how much effort each project will require. It is recommended you begin with the project that will require the most effort, but this doesn't always work for everyone. You may feel more motivated if you can complete another important task that takes less time and then dive into the lengthier project.Just make sure you have enough time to complete the lengthier project if you do the other project first.

, Risk and profit are both good ways to look at projects, but either one can lead you astray by itself. An effective way to prioritize many projects is by looking at the ratio of risk to profit. A project that has a large yield with little risk involved should be priority. A project that will not yield any real benefit, but might cause serious problems should be delayed or possibly even cut altogether., If you are still struggling to prioritize, it may help to take important projects and compare them directly. There are several options for head-to-head comparisons. Methods such as forced ranking, paired comparisons, and q-sorts can be used to look at the pros and cons of one project as they relate to another. Forced ranking usually emerges by default if no other prioritization plan is put in place.Forced Ranking. Rank each project individually or in groups. The highest ranked project gets done first, and the projects are done in order of rank until they are all complete or you run out of time or other resources. This method is not the most efficient method if you have too many projects, have to consult too many people on your decisions, or are working on complex issues.Paired comparisons. Take two projects and compare them side-by-side. Once you choose a high priority project and a low priority project from the two, you can bring in a third project and see where it ranks (above the high priority, below the low priority, or in between them). This tends to break down with too many projects, but you can use a playoff approach to compare more projects when needed.Q-sorts. Have everyone involved in prioritization write the projects on separate index cards. Each person in the group will separate the projects into piles of very high, high, medium, low, and very low priority. Once you have sorted your piles, you compare and see what projects ranked the highest overall. Then, you can start working on your projects accordingly., A prioritization matrix is a way of assigning value to a set of tasks. If you create your own, you can easily decide on what factors you consider most valuable (money, ease, etc.). Be sure that you assign a numerical value, or weight, to each project and a numerical value, or rating scale, to each of your evaluation criteria. The total prioritization score for each project will be the weight of the project multiplied by the score it received on the rating scale.This works great for evaluating projects that have considerations other than profit and risk.

, There will often be factors that do not show up in the prioritization matrix or cost analysis, such as personal preference. There are also factors that will come up after youâve finished your planning session, like emergency meetings or family emergencies. You have to consider these factors in your decision as well, and remain flexible enough to shift your priorities accordingly."

Know the Project Vision.,
Describe the Project System.,
Arrange the Approach to Implementation.,
List the Dangers and Troubles.,
Download Project Charter Template from here: http://tools.adaptivebms.com/;
",How to Make Your Project Charter," The first measure taken when determining a Project Charter is to identify the project vision. The vision encapsulates the purpose of the project and is the fixed end goal for the project team.


Identify your objectives. Then supported on the vision, list three to 5 targets to be reached by the project. Every aim should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Real and Time-bound (SMART).
Determine the Scope. With a good prospect of the Vision and Targets of the project, it's time to determine the project scope. The scope specifies the prescribed edges of the project by identifying how the business will be changed or altered by the project delivery. Deliverables: Then you require to distinguish each of the deliverables that the project will created.

, The succeeding step is to identify how the project will be structured by listing the clients, stakeholders, functions, responsibilities and reporting lines.


Customers. First, determine the project customers. A client is a person or individual that is obliged for receiving the deliverables when the project is accomplished.
Stakeholders. Then determine the project stakeholders. A stakeholder is a person or entity within or outside of the project with a specific key involvement or stake in the project. For example, a Financial Controller will be involved in the price of the project, and a CEO will be concerned in whether the project aids to attain the company vision.
Roles. Now list the main roles needed in delivering the project. Examples of roles specifies the Project Sponsor, Project Board and Project Manager. Then sum up each of the serious obligations of each role known.
Structure. Once you get a good survey of the functions essential to undertake the project, you can describe the reporting lines between those purposes within a Project Organization Chart.

, You now have a solid definition of what the project requires to accomplish and how it will be arranged to accomplish it. The succeeding step is to distinguish the implementation approach as follows.


Implementation Plan. To give the Client and Stakeholders with confidence that the project execution has been well thought through, create an Implementation Plan naming the phases, activities and timeframes required in undertaking the project.
Milestones. In addition, list several necessary milestones and describe why they are vital to the project. A milestone is typically an important project event, such as the achievement of a key deliverable.
Dependencies. Name some key dependencies and their critically to the project. A dependency is defined as an action that is probably to impact on the project during its life cycle.
Resource Plan. Develop a plan which sums up the funds included in undertaking the project by listing the labor, equipment and materials involved. Then budget the financial resources needed.

, The last step needed to complete your Project Charter is to specify some project dangers, issues, premises and constraints related to the project.

Understand what strengths are.,
Find your strengths.,
Write strength statements.,
Use your strengths in the workplace.,
Plan around your weaknesses.,
Create a strong leadership team.,
Build relationships with those on your team.,
Lead others in identifying and using their strengths.",How to Lead With Your Strengths," Strengths have recently been defined as activities that make you feel strong. Everyone has certain talents, knowledge, and skills that make them feel successful and unique.


Talents are aptitudes, personality traits, or interpersonal characteristics like assertiveness, curiosity, empathy, or strategic thinking. These are often things you are born with.
Knowledge is information based on facts and personal experience, like symptoms for a specific illness, the structure of a good speech, or how to take care of a horse.
Skills are learned activities or tasks that you can do well, such as presenting a speech, playing a sport, or creating a spreadsheet.;
, Strength-based leadership requires you to be aware of your own strengths. Realize that some strengths play more to leadership than others. Try to focus on those. There are several ways you can identify your strengths.


Take a strengths assessment test. These assessments help you identify specific strengths based on how you answer certain questions.
Take a personal inventory. List activities you enjoy and that come easily to you. Identify tasks that energize you. List your values and beliefs. Identify knowledge you have that others around you do not.
Look at past performance reviews. Note what your supervisors or colleagues praise you for.
Ask others. Friends, family members, and colleagues can often point out things we do well that we may assume came naturally to everyone but are really special strengths we alone possess.

, Theses statements capture, in one sentence, what it is that makes you feel strong. Try to identify three areas of strength to focus on. Be as specific as possible. For example, ""I feel strong when I am coaching my team to meet project goals"" or ""I feel strong when I write a clear report outlining potential steps for my organization to take.""

, Keep your strength statements in a place where you can see them as you work. Each week, try to find another way that you could play to your strengths as a leader in your organization.


Identify how each strength can be used in your current role as a leader.
Find specific activities that play to your strengths. These activities often leave you feeling confident, energized, and eager to do it again.
Modify your role so that you use your strengths instead of your weaknesses.
Invest in your strengths. Find ways to further develop the skills and knowledge you have. Participate in training, workshops, and conferences. You can also read books or blogs that deal with your leadership area.

, In strengths-based leadership, you need to focus your time and energy on the things you do well. Therefore, it is important to find the necessary tools to help you deal with your weaknesses.


Utilize appropriate technology. Tools like online calendars, smart phones, and alarms can help you stay organized and on time.
Delegate tasks to other people. When possible, pass a task on to someone else that is better suited for it.
Collaborate with others on group projects and assign tasks based on each person's strengths.

, Choose people who both complement your strengths and help fill in the gaps. You should have an individual who demonstrates strength in each of the following areas.


People strong in execution will be able to implement plans and procedures effectively and in a timely manner.
People strong in matters of influence will be able to communicate ideas to different people in or outside of the organization and motivate them to join your mission.
People strong in relationships will be able to help the team work through conflict, minimize potential distractions, and keep energy levels high.
People strong in strategic thinking will be able to brainstorm other possibilities, collect and organize data, and analyze information.

, Followers need to know that you care about them, not necessarily that you can recite the mission or vision of the organization. The most influential leaders create an environment of trust, compassion, stability, and hope. Use your strengths to communicate and connect with your followers.

, As a leader, you can help your employees take similar steps to find and use their strengths at work.


Acknowledge what other people do well.
Provide employees opportunities to grow in their talents, skills, and knowledge.
Restructure performance reviews to focus more on strengths than on areas of weaknesses that need to be improved. This helps empower people to own their own strengths and recognize their weaknesses without focusing too much on them.

Make a master document.",How to Organize a Filing Cabinet," Look for a good quality cabinet thatâs a good size for your home or office within your budget. Consider a fireproof and waterproof cabinet, in case of any natural disasters that may strike your home. A bundle of such cabinets are found in local stores, furniture shops, carpentry shops and malls., Set aside anything thatâs obviously old or unnecessary. Set aside:


Receipts for products you no longer own.
Junk Mail
Old bills for services you no longer use
Business letters from an old job
Stamps you no longer need

, While certain documents like birth certificates and tax information are obviously important, there may be junk mail or old receipts that looks important but really isn't. Think about each document as you make your decision, and think about whether it could actually be useful in the future. If you wouldn't miss it if it disappeared for a year, it's probably alright to throw it out., Make sure to ask your supervisors before you throw anything out, as it may be more important than you think. Your company may also have policies about how long things need to be kept and how they need to be disposed of.

, This will generally depend on how recent or useful they are. Use discretion and think about whether the documents will be useful or necessary in the future. If they're truly important, keep them. For tax info, insurance records and vital documents, keep them for the following periods of time:Keep tax return information for 7 years, as well as any receipts for items you deducted from your taxes. The IRS can audit any return up to 6 years after your taxes are filed.
Keep insurance records, mortgage statements and proof of charitable donations for up to three years.
Make sure to keep very important documents like birth and marriage certificates, social security cards, titles, deeds, and passports. Keep them safe and never get rid of them.

, Throwing out unshredded documents can leave your personal information exposed to anyone who sees them. Even if you're not sure whether the document is sensitive, it's best to shred it as it may contain addresses, birth dates or other info.

, Many towns and businesses will have shred days where locals or employees can bring old floppy disks, CDs or hard drives to be destroyed. They'll make sure it's done correctly. , Move to a desk or big table and organize the papers into piles that are logical and sensible to you. These will become your individual files. Make piles that will help you find exactly what youâre looking for. Consider categories for home cabinets such as:


Utilities
Auto
Medical
Pet
Business
Home
Taxes
Finances

, There may be specific company conventions for organizing papers. If not, file chronologically or alphabetically. Ask tidy coworkers what systems work best for them.

, The more specific you get, the more files youâll have, which will mean more clutter in your cabinet. Keep your main files more general, and then organize documents within them. , Once you've sorted each paper into its correct pile, begin to organize them in a way that'll make it easy to find.


For alphabetical listings, like brands on receipts, place items starting with A at the top of the stack, working down to Z.
For chronological filings, like dates of tax returns, place the most recent documents on the top of the stack, working towards oldest documents at the bottom.

, Put the papers in so that the document at the top of the stack is at the front of the folder. This will keep the documents in the same order that you organized them in.

, Make sure that the writing on the tab is large, legible, and makes sense to you and others in your office or family. Use a label maker for extra clarity., Divide your files among drawers in ways that make sense to you, with each drawer containing a distinct category. Each category should contain related files, which will help you find things more easily.


Financial information like tax documents, investment files and mortgage statements might go in one drawer.
Personal documents like birth certificates, passports and medical records might go in another drawer.
Instruction manuals for various items might go in another.

, If you commit the corresponding color to memory, it'll make your papers much easier to find. If you already have manilla folders, add color to them with highlighters or colored markers. Colored labels can be used more subtly for the same purpose.

, An Informational Materials drawer, for example, might be divided into folders like ""Electronics Manuals,"" ""Power Tool Manuals"" and ""Cleaning Supply Manuals"".

, After a month or two of use, don't be afraid to change the things that aren't working for you. Move different files to the front, or break up categories that are hard to tell apart. Remember that your filing cabinet is a system for you, and it needs to conform to your work flow.

, Pay immediate attention to mail and documents as they come in, and once youâve dealt with them, file them right away. , Look through your incoming mail once a day. You wonât lose track of anything this way, and it wonât pile up. Filing wonât seem like such a chore it's done a little bit at a time.

, Yearly reorganization is recommended, and you can even clean it out quarterly if you have a large number of files. The main source of clutter in filing cabinets is old documents that you no longer need, so purge and shred the old things as necessary.

, The more documents you can keep in digital format, the less physical clutter youâll have in a filing cabinet. Good candidates for scanning include receipts, proofs of donation, or bank statements. Some may even be available online already. , In the document, explain how your filing system works and where things are located. In the event of an emergency or unforeseen problem, others may need to know how to look for your files. "

Find a venue.,
Schedule a keynote speaker and session presenters.,
Be conscience about the time.,
Offer food and beverages.,
Follow up with conference participants.",How to Lead a Conference,"


It is important to have a general idea of how many people you expect to attend the conference before booking a venue. If this is the first year for a conference, or the number could vary quite a bit, you may want to choose a hotel or conference center that will allow you to expand or scale down depending on the type of turnout you receive.;
,


A keynote speaker is someone well-known in the field that has something to offer to all participants and will open up the entire meeting with his or her presentation. The keynote address is often a more broad topic than the subsequent breakout sessions.
Session presenters need to submit proposals ahead of time, so you can choose which sessions would go together most appropriately. When choosing presenters, you will also have to be careful to select what seem to be the most well-planned sessions and will have the most to offer participants.

,


Schedule the sessions for a reasonable amount of time -- 50 minutes, an hour at most. The idea is that the sessions will be specific and allow the attendees to walk away with something concrete that will help them in their fields. Don't forget to schedule breaks between every couple of sessions to give participants, and presenters, the chance to recharge. Breaks are also a good time to have poster sessions in the lobby or a raffle entry for a free conference attendance for next year's event.

,


Conferences often run the length of a day, maybe even two. Food and drinks may help to give participants that extra boost they need to get through the whole day. Consider offering snack foods during breaks and a nice sit-down lunch. These opportunities also allow for networking, which is often done more easily over a cookie and a cup of coffee.

,


You can either have conference feedback cards included in the conference packet or send a follow-up email or postcard after the event it over. Either way, remember to keep it anonymous so you receive the most honest answers possible. It is important to know what the conference participants thought of your conference planning. Hearing the pros and cons of your conference choices will help you plan accordingly for future conferences.

Work more efficiently.,
Reduce or eliminate distractions at work.,
Eat healthy snacks throughout the day.,
Stay hydrated throughout the day.,
Show an interest in your employees' wellbeing.,
Set goals for and measure employee productivity.,
Implement positive reinforcement for good work.,
Give your employees some down time.,
Maintain a comfortable temperature.,
Increase the amount of natural light in your workplace.,
Be mindful of noise in the workplace.,
Make your workplace look more comfortable.",How to Increase Workplace Productivity," One of the easiest ways to increase your productivity is by changing the way you work. By streamlining your workload and focusing on one task at a time, you'll increase your efficiency and, as a result, your productivity at work.


Make short and long-term to-do lists. It will help you stay focused and keep on top of the projects you need to complete for that day, week, and month.Avoid multitasking. Instead, focus on one task at a time and avoid jumping from one project to another.Multitasking has in fact been proven to reduce, not improve, productivity.
Devote your attention to the tasks that need to be completed first. Keep projects with later dates on the back burner, but make incremental progress on tasks that have approaching deadlines.;
, There are many things that can get in the way of a productive workday. Chatty coworkers, distracting activities, and looming concerns about things you need to do after work can all affect your ability to concentrate. By making small changes in how you work, you can block out these distractions and get down to business every day.


Many employees find that it's easier to get work done if you get to work early. Fewer coworkers often means fewer distractions at work.Try turning off the sound on your computer and phone so you don't get alerts.You should also turn your cellphone off while you're working so you're not tempted to check for texts, missed calls, or social media notifications.
Give yourself a 5 to 10 minute break every hour or so to check your email and indulge in the distractions you've been otherwise putting off.Try stretching and walking around to reduce physical stress from sitting.

, You may have a hard time focusing on your work if you're feeling hungry or suffering from low blood-sugar levels. Snacking during the day can help you feel better and concentrate more easily, but you should choose healthy snacks to avoid crashing later in the day.High-fiber foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and beans can all help you power through a long work day with increased concentration and motivation.
Fruits and vegetables with high levels of antioxidants can help boost concentration. Try snacking on berries, tomatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli.
Bananas, sunflower seeds, and coffee (in moderation) can all help improve concentration and motivation due to their ability to increase your body's levels of dopamine.
Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids may help improve concentration. Try eating salmon, trout, mackerel, or sardines for lunch, and snack on walnuts or flax seeds throughout the day.

, It's important to stay hydrated every day, but you may not know that dehydration can affect workplace performance. Even mild dehydration, which can set in after just 40 minutes of sedentary office work, can cause difficulty in concentration and performing mental tasks.Aim to drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses of non-alcoholic fluid each day to stay properly hydrated.
You can gauge your level of dehydration by assessing the color of your urine. Darker urine means you need more water.Keep a bottle of water at your desk throughout the day so you can always have water on hand when you need it.

, When employees feel like their managers care, they're often more willing to work harder and share responsibility in meeting the company's goals. An easy way to make employees feel cared for is to be kind to your employees. Make sure your employees' needs are being met and let them know that their efforts have not gone unnoticed.Listen to your employees when they have grievances or complaints. Being heard and seeing positive changes can make workers feel more motivated to help the company.
Show an interest in your employees' work-life balance. Don't ask intrusive questions, but be understanding when employees need time off for doctors' appointments, family events, and other personal matters.
Treat your employees the way you would want to be treated. Be kind without being weak and always offer guidance and support.

, If you want to keep your employees motivated, you'll need to know what level they're currently working at and what level they need to be at. You can do this by setting realistic, obtainable goals and offering support along the way.Ask employees how productive and efficient they see themselves, and offer to let them have input into how productivity is assessed.
Factor in considerations like how much of a job is repetitive versus original/creative work.
Include (but don't solely rely on) objective factors like the number of sales calls made, reports filed, or functions coded. Balance this with subjective factors like management ratings and employee satisfaction.
Remember that employees are still part of a team. If one employee isn't performing up to par, look at how his or her coworkers are managing their end of the work to ensure that that employee isn't left hanging with extra projects.

, Good work should not go unrecognized. Every employee who meets his or her productivity goals should be rewarded in some way, as your company would not be able to function properly without those employees.Thank employees for their hard work and let them know that you value and appreciate their efforts.
Personal incentives can do wonders to motivate employees.Consider offering small bonuses/commissions to highly-productive employees.
Throw a pizza party or sundae buffet when employees meet their goals for the month.

, Hard-working employees need some down time to maintain productivity. Working constantly without interruption is draining and may lead to performance problems down the line. You can avoid this problem by allowing your employees to balance work time and down time.Allow for short breaks throughout the day, whether that means water cooler talk, a coffee break, or a short break to step outside for some fresh air. Breaks help improve productivity and boost morale.
Make sure your employees have vacation options. A short vacation can do wonders for an employee's mindset and motivation.
Reducing internet restrictions on social media and other websites can give your employees a much-needed break during the day. However, some managers feel that social media is too big of a distraction in the workplace and should be banned.

, The physical environment of your workplace can make a huge difference in how your employees work. Some studies have shown that a workplace that's too warm or too cool can make it more difficult to concentrate for prolonged periods of time.Keep the office between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 25 degrees Celsius). This is often seen as the ideal temperature range to keep workers focused and comfortable.

, Depending on your office location and setup, you may be forced to rely on artificial lighting. However, if your office has windows, you may want to keep the curtains/blinds open to allow more sunlight inside. This helps employees feel more alert and rejuvenated, which can improve the overall productivity of your workplace., Some noise is often unavoidable in the workplace, no matter what field you work in. Too much noise can be a distraction, though, so it's important to find ways to reduce noise as much as possible.Try to minimize noisy distractions by putting loud equipment in another room (if at all possible).
Some repetitive tasks are easier to concentrate on when employees have the option of listening to music. Just make sure that employees use headphones to avoid disrupting others.
Offer your employees a quiet place to work when they need to focus and reduce environmental noise.

, The physical appearance of your workplace can send psychological cues to your employees. A comfortable yet stimulating workplace can make it easier to get work done, while other types of environmental cues may actually hinder productivity.Choose a color scheme for the office that's more conducive to worker productivity. Yellow is often considered a stimulating yet comfortable color, red is considered arousing/aggressive, and white is considered open and sterile.
Give your employees someplace to congregate, like a water cooler or a break room.
Cubicles may be a fixture of many offices, but studies have shown that they're actually damaging to employee productivity.Try to give your workers a choice in their type of work environment, if you have the space and the means to do so. If not, opt for an open office to facilitate better communication and collaboration.

Decide if a cruise ship job or career is the right choice for you.,
Understand how a cruise ship operates.,
Make a list of cruise ship jobs that are available.",How to Work on Cruise Ships1," Although it can be a wonderful way to see the world, there are some considerations you should take into account.


Determine if you suffer easily from seasickness. Some light seasickness can be expected amongst even the seasoned pros; however, cruise crew and staff generally sleep at the bottom of the ship where there are few windows and tight spaces. If these are problems for you, then a cruise ship will probably not be a good environment for your work.
Consider if you are up to working 7 days a week. People who work on cruise ships work varying hours every day of the week for the duration of the contract. You may get 2 to 4 months vacation between contracts, but you can expect to work up to 14 hours per day.
Decide if you are able to spend months with little communication with the outside world. Cruise ship jobs are often taken by young, single people because they must work for months away from home. Some Internet is available on board, for a fee.;
, If you are not an experienced cruise patron, you may need to do your research to get an idea of the general hierarchy of cruise ships. They are run similarly to hotels; however, there are many differences that separate them from normal company jobs.


Officers are employed to run the ship. The captain is in charge of navigation as well as hotel/hospitality duties. The officers generally come from the place of the cruise ship's origin, such as Greece, Norway, Holland or the United States. These are coveted jobs usually given to people who have worked in seafaring industries for years. The officers interact regularly with passengers, while it is discouraged outside of work for other employees.
The staff is responsible for the management of the ship's day to day activities. The crew can include some entry-level and other management jobs. The crew usually stay in their own room or have 1 other roommate. They are often native English speakers because they interact with the passengers. Included in the staff are the hotel managers, entertainment, technicians, photographers and fitness instructors. Much of the staff can enjoy some port privileges.
The concessionaires are people who are often hired by outside agencies to run casinos, gift shops and other stores. Cruise ships often, but not always, contract these services to outside companies. In this case, it is likely you will need to seek employment with that outside company and discuss the frequency of cruise ship assignments. Many concessionaires must close their shops during port calls, so they get to enjoy the cruise destinations.
The crew are often considered the lowest in the chain of command. These are the cooks, busboys, bar staff, waiters and cleaning and maintenance staff. The wages for this work are lower than other positions, so most workers come from countries with a lower cost or standard of living. Crew live on the bottom decks and work the most hours. Some crew do not get to leave during port calls.

, Visit websites for ""the big 3,"" Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise lines, to look for job opportunities. They should list a wide variety of staff and crew positions.


Looking for more than 1 position will increase your chances of getting a cruise ship position. People from around the world apply for jobs on these ships, so you will be facing hundreds or thousands of competitors. Choose positions that directly apply to your education and/or work experience.

Conduct an honest self-evaluation.Review your job description and responsibilities and rate your performance in each area.,
Ask co-workers to evaluate you.,
Complete an evaluation with your supervisor.,
Address a poor performance review.,
Compile a list of your strengths.Although you may be focused on your areas of improvement, taking a look at your strengths can help you improve your job performance.When you know what your strengths are, you know what internal resources you have to support your improvements.,
Make a list of your areas for improvement.,
Set performance goals for yourself.",How to Improve Your Job Performance2," Being honest about how you are doing will help you determine what areas you need to work on to improve your job performance.You can rate whether you are âexceeding expectationsâ, âmeeting expectationsâ, or âneed improvementâ in each area.
Make a list of strengths and weaknesses in each area. For example, you might put that youâre good at writing reports, but donât submit them on time.

, One way to get an idea of how you are performing on the job is to ask your co-workers. Their perceptions of your work can give you an idea of what areas you need to improve in and what areas you are doing well in.


You could ask them to write a few words on a sticky note that describe your work performance and put it in an envelope for that purpose on your desk.
For example, you could say, âWould you write a few words about my work on here and put it in the envelope hanging outside my cubicle?â
You could also create a brief, anonymous online survey for them to complete.
If you are comfortable with it, you could ask for feedback face to face. You might say, âWould you give me some feedback on my work performance?â

, This might be the most important feedback you can receive. This will let you know how your supervisor thinks you are doing and how they think you can improve your job performance.It will also give insight into what exactly your supervisor is looking for in a great employee.Most companies have specific times of the year when they evaluate employees. Check with your supervisor to see when your next evaluation is due.
You could say, âHow long after I have been employed will it be before I am evaluated?â Or, âWhen do we have our evaluations?â
You can always ask your supervisor for informal feedback regarding your work performance or a specific task or assignment.
For example, you might ask your boss, âWould you mind meeting with me about how I did on this last report?â

, Talk to your supervisor about the review and what implications it may have. Use this review as a way to improve your job performance by showing you exactly what areas your supervisor feels you need work in.Ask your supervisor for specific examples of how you can improve your job performance.
For example, you might say, âIn my review it said I need to improve my leadership skills. Could you give me examples of how I can do this?â
Focus on the lowest areas on your review. Although you want to improve overall, these are the areas critical to you maintaining employment.
For instance, if you had negative remarks regarding your attendance, you should work on improving that before you work on your leadership skills.

,


Make a list of strengths that you, your co-workers, or your supervisor mentioned in your evaluations.
Highlight those strengths that were mentioned by more than one person or more than once in general.
For example, you might write âreliableâ and âdependableâ and also write and highlight âdiligentâ because you and your supervisor mentioned it.

, You will know exactly what you need to do to improve your job performance if you review the feedback from your evaluations. Look for things that you, your coworkers, and supervisor feel that you can do better.


Look for keywords in your evaluations like: improve, increase, strengthen, expand, or develop.
Look for reoccurring themes in your evaluations like being on time, checking your facts, or being a team player.

, Once you know what areas you need to improve in and what strengths you have to make the improvements, you can set goals. Goal-setting will help make your improvements in your job performance concrete and hold you accountable.Set goals related to increasing your productivity. For example, you might set a goal to submit five additional applications a day.
Break each goal down into doable action steps. For instance, in order to submit five more applications daily you might need to file and review them faster.

Get active.,
Get enough sleep.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Improve Your Job Performance3," Some studies indicate that regular physical activity can increase productivity at work.Improve your job performance by working out or doing something active a few times a week.


Take a brief walk during your lunch break or park further away from the entrance so that you have to walk a little further from the car each morning.
Join a gym close to your job or use your companyâs fitness center, if you have one.
Do ten to twenty minutes of yoga or tai chi in the morning before work or go for a brisk jog or swim.

, Lack of sleep can impact your concentration, mood, energy, and, in turn, have a negative effect on your job performance.Create a nightly routine that allows you to get plenty of rest.


Start preparing for bed an hour or so in advance. Do things that calm and relax your body and mind like meditating, reading, or yoga.
Avoid caffeine in the hour before you plan to go to sleep. Instead of coffee or caffeinated tea, go for decaf or a glass of water.
Put your phone on silent or turn off non-essential notifications until the morning.

, The practice of focusing only on the task at hand and focusing on that task with all of your senses can help improve your concentration.Improving your concentration can help you be more productive and improve your job performance.


Instead of multitasking, do one thing at a time. Focus all your attention on that one thing.
For example, instead of checking your email while you complete your inventory sheet, focus only on the inventory.
If you find your mind wandering or that you are daydreaming, gently bring your thoughts back to the task at hand.
You might say to yourself, âI started thinking about the game. Let me focus on the inventory.â

Make a list of your employees.,
Identify how long each employee has been at the company.,
Determine each employee's leadership potential.,
Evaluate each employee's level of work ethic.,
Ascertain which employees demonstrate a positive or a negative attitude.,
Identify which employees value and demonstrate honesty and integrity.

,
Identify which employees are averse to action or fail to focus their actions on overall corporate goals.,
Create a chart listing each position at the company.,
Update your list of employees and attributes as changes arise.",How to Identify the Office VIPs in Your Company,"


Use your computer or human resources system so you can easily access and edit this list over time.
An employee that has been with the company for a long period of time has two distinct benefits. One, that employee demonstrates loyalty. Two, that employee has intimate knowledge of the business. He or she is fully trained and aware of all protocol procedures and company policies.;
, Note any promotions or position changes within the company as well and how long he or she has held each position.

,


Mark those who are already in a leadership role, either assigned or taken on by choice. Also identify anyone who seems to demonstrate the potential for positive leadership skills.
It can be difficult to quantify intangible personality traits. To help make your assessment more meaningful, assign each person's work ethic a number between 1 and 10. It will still involve judgment, but the hard numbers will help create workable data.

, Within this parameter, also consider factors such as willingness to work overtime and dedication to the quality of work output.

,


Even in jobs that don't directly require group cooperation, key employees are those that know how to get along with many different personality types. Use complaints filed by or against an employee with human resources as a gauge of an employee's overall attitude and temperament at work.
Employees that are secretive or overly sensitive are generally counterproductive to a team, especially at the management level.

,,


Missing deadlines is, of course, a red flag for any employee. Be equally cautious, however, of those who always appear busy but are actually dedicating all time and effort on small tasks with little consequence or outcome.

, Write who does the position now as well as who else could also do the position. This helps identify which employees have specialized skills as well as those employees that are capable of fulfilling multiple roles.

, These can be changes in personnel, changes in position or changes in work performance.

Contact cruise ship recruiters and cruise ship job search websites, if you aren't able to find a job through conventional Internet search methods.,
Contact cruise ship hiring departments and recruiters to update your resume.",How to Work on Cruise Ships2," The following are general guidelines for writing a cruise ship resume:


Use an accepted electronic format, such as Microsoft Word, Portable Document Format or Rich Text Format. Keep your resume to a length of 1 or 2 pages with no less than 10 point font.
List your work experience in reverse chronological order. People with extensive work experience should list it before education on their resume. Include the skills under each job that directly apply to the cruise ship position you are apply for. Don't assume that any human resources person will know the company or job, since they may be hiring from a different country.
List your education starting with the highest level of education you have received. Include any honors you received. People who have little work experience may need to list their education first. They may also want to apply for entry-level jobs in order to gain experience.
List all languages, including your level of fluency. Create a section for special skills that relate to the job. You may even want to list travel experience. Highlight any skills in the hospitality or travel industries.
Include a photograph of yourself, if asked. Although this is not generally done in the United States, it is required by some companies. Make it a professional, flattering photo. Choose 1 that does not include other people.
Include 2 to 3 business references. They should be people who can vouch for your good work ethic, customer service skills and integrity. Make sure to include the numbers in international format that includes the country code.

, In 400 words or less, highlight your experience, skills and education that mean you are an ideal fit for the position. Make sure to customize the cover letter for each different position you are applying for.

, If you have experience working with youth, you may have a better chance of getting a job on a Disney cruise. If you have experience working with seniors, adventure travelers or other niche markets, use it to your advantage in your resume and cover letter.

, Make sure you are using a legitimate site or company before paying any money to search.

, If you don't get a cruise ship job the first time around, look for jobs with hospitality experience and reapply for new positions as they are listed.

The possible duration for the conference call â So that anyone doesn't schedule something else at same time and if you have many topics on same con call, you can assign a certain time for each topic too.
The objective â Whether the objective of a conference call is to provide information, attend to questions or take a decision, if the objective and necessary information is communicated, you can expect the callers to come prepared accordingly.
Emergency procedure â You have several callers, you can ask them to call or sms you about any last minute cancellation, delay or connectivity problem from their end.

, The following guidelines should be considered when creating your resume:Create your resume in an internationally accepted format, such as Microsoft Word (DOC), Portable Document Format (PDF), or Rich Text Format (RTF). Try to limit your resume to 1 or 2 pages, with no less than 10 point font.
Show your professionalism with your resume format, photograph, cover letter, and application. Pay attention to the details and ensure there are no mistakes or inappropriate content.

, It is not necessary for you to have previous cruise ship experience, but you must highlight applicable experience. List skills that show you have a passion and drive for your work.


Cruise ships like to hire people that are self-motivated hard workers. Show any examples of honors you received for your work in the past.
Highlight your customer service and communication skills. Hiring managers want to see that you are an outgoing personality with a tireless love for working with people.

, Your cover letter should enumerate how your past work experience fulfills all the requirements. In 400 words or less, highlight why you have the drive and passion to succeed in cruise ship employment., Norwegian Cruise Lines hold job fairs throughout the United States in June. Visit their Pride of America employment website to find dates and requirements for the closest job fair.Bring copies of your resume and wear professional attire. This job fair specifically hires employees for dedicated Hawaii cruises. The Pride of America is the only cruise ship that flies the American flag, so they do their primary recruiting in America.

, Many cruise ship companies conduct weekly interviews in order to keep their ships well staffed. Visit the website, call ahead and arrange an interview with each company at their convenience.


Bring your completed application and resume to your interview. Make sure to practice interview questions related to your work experience and customer service skills. Appear professional during each interaction with the cruise company.

, Choose a job you know you can do or take classes or train for a position youâd like to have. For example, get lifeguard training in your hometown or get certified as a scuba instructor before applying for those positions on a cruise ship. Similarly, work as a hotel housekeeper before accepting a housekeeping position on board the ship.


Donât lie or fib on your resume -- if you arenât able to do the job properly, your employer will quickly notice.

, A cruise ship and its staff stay busy 24 hours a day. You will likely work long shifts with a few short breaks. You will be constantly busy, and in some cases, you donât get a full day off for the entire duration of the cruise! If this doesnât sound like something you would enjoy, working on a cruise ship may not be for you.

, Cruise ships have strict protocols that you will be expected to follow. For example, on some cruise ships you are not allowed to enter guest areas unless you are working in them. You may also be prohibited from disembarking the ship., You should always be courteous to all guests, staff, and crew members. Remember that your actions reflect back on the cruise line, so donât use curse words, engage in inappropriate behavior, or drink too much alcohol on your time off.

, Ensure you have everything you need to complete your job to the best of your ability. For example, if you are a musician, bring your instruments and tuning equipment with you. Also, make sure you pack everything youâll need for an extended period at sea, such as:


Personal hygiene products (toothbrush and paste, shampoo and conditioner, body wash, razors, deodorant, makeup, hair products or tools, sunscreen, bug repellent, etc.),
Clothes (youâll need undergarments for your uniform as well as shoes, a swimsuit, and clothes to wear on your days off),
Books, games, or activities for down time, and
Your cell phone and/or laptop to keep in touch with friends and family.

, You will be able to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii, and likely other places, on your down time. Explore the port cities, swim or snorkel in the ocean, and take advantage crew-only amenities. Ask other staff members for recommendations on activities and restaurants at port locations."

Have a valid, appropriate driver's license.,
Have experience in the type of driving you wish to teach.,
Complete basic education requirements.,
Attend an approved driving instructor training program.,
Get your driving instruction license.,
Get certified as a driving instructor.",How to Train to Be a Driving Instructor," Before you can train to be a driving instructor, you need to have a valid driver's license to drive the type of vehicle you wish to teach others how to drive, and it must be valid in the state or country in which you want to teach.


Your license must not have been recently suspended or revoked. (The exact length of time may vary from state to state, but the most common length of time is 2 years.) You also cannot have had a license suspended or revoked in another state prior to receiving a license in your current state.
There may also be restrictions as to how many penalty points can be assessed against your license without it being suspended or revoked. For instance, to enroll in a driving instruction program in Great Britain, you cannot have more than 6 points assessed against your license. You may also be unable to become a driving instructor if you've been convicted of a crime involving a motor vehicle, regardless of when or whether your license has been suspended, revoked, or had points assessed against it.;
, In most cases, you'll need at least 2 to 3 years of experience doing the kind of driving in which you wish to become a driving instructor. (If you plan to teach others how to drive tractor-trailer rigs, this may be longer.)

, You need to be proficient in the language of the country in which you will be teaching to be able to read and teach others to read road signs and to communicate with law enforcement personnel when necessary. This usually means at least the equivalent of a high school education.


If you plan to teach driver education in a public school setting, you'll need a college degree in education.

, To teach others how to drive, you must attend and graduate from an accredited driver instructor program. A driver instructor program consists of classroom instruction in both traffic laws and how to teach them to others, observing driving lessons given to others by certified instructors, and teaching others how to drive while being observed by a certified instructor.

, Once you graduate, you need to apply with the state or country in which you plan to be a driving instructor for your license. You may also be required to submit to a physical examination and, in states or countries that permit driving instructors to teach independent of a school, an examination of the vehicle in which you plan to instruct others.

, Certification is not available or required for all types of driving instruction but can be helpful as a networking tool when you're looking for work as a driving instructor. One certification organization is the Commercial Vehicle Training Association, which represents truck driver training schools and instructors.

Attend a reputable recovery agent school.,
Ask to ride along with an established repossession agent.,
Acquire the tools necessary for a successful repossession.,
Obtain licenses and certifications required in your state.,
Be willing to work late night or early morning hours.",How to Get a Job Repossessing Cars,"


Reputable recovery agent schools can be located online. Some repossession companies actually offer their own training. Although not specifically required in all states, attending recovery agent school can help you obtain employment as a repossession agent.;
,


Since many of the skills necessary to be successful repossessing cars are learned on-the-job, riding with a licensed asset recovery agent will help you gain experience and learn some of the knowledge that may not be taught in the classroom.

,


Although some companies provide their employees with the tools necessary, having some of them when will show that you are familiar with car repossession. Tools such as a flashlight, various lengths of tow straps, jumper cables and a Global Positioning System (GPS) are helpful.

,


Many states and cities have specific licensing and certification requirements in order for you to get a job repossessing cars. To learn the requirements in your city or state, visit http://repoindustry.com/articles/Licensing_By_State.html.

Repossession agents normally work between the hours of 4 and 7 AM as that is when most vehicles will be located close to home.

Decide which commitments are unnecessary.,
See how much time you spend on each project.,
Eliminate workspace distractions.,
Schedule time for interruptions.,
Organize your work area.,
Prioritize tasks by deadline.",How to Complete a High Volume Workload1," In your workplace, you may have many commitments besides the ones that pertain to your current high volume project. Take some time and evaluate these commitments. Do they pertain specifically to your job description? Is there a coworker who is more qualified to deal with them?Get permission to eliminate commitments that arenât necessarily your job. Tell your boss that tasks outside of the specific workload are taking away from your productivity, and your boss may be willing to let you give them to someone else.
Return work to coworkers that you took as a favor if you have recently taken on a high volume workload. When you have a high volume workload, you have to stop taking other peopleâs responsibilities.;
, Make a time log for recording how much time you spend on a typical portion of your workload. Once you have established how long youâre taking, you can take action to reduce that time. You can also use this time frame for building a more effective daily schedule.It might be helpful to build a spreadsheet of how long it takes for each project so that the data can be automatically generated into whatever type of visual helps you bestâa line chart, a graph, etc.
Make rows for each project name, duration, and start and stop time. You can even make a row for interruptions and include those start and stop times.

, Once you have charted your daily work experience, you will have a visual guide for where you can stop doing things that detract from your work flow. For example, you can turn off email notifications so that you arenât chasing emails on demand, but rather set aside blocks of time for emailing.


You can do the same for phone calls by turning off the ringer and situating the phone where you canât see missed alerts. Turn off alerts for social media and any other apps on both phone and computer.
Prevent coworkers from approaching your workspace by putting up a âdo not disturbâ sign at times when you need uninterrupted focus.

, No one can avoid being interrupted in a busy workplace. Instead of shutting your door and telling no one to talk to you all day, schedule times in the day that you are willing be to be interrupted. For example, if youâre a professor, advertising âoffice hoursâ means you are allowing students to interrupt you whenever they need help.You can use the activity log you created to show you what time of day you are most likely to be needed by coworkers, and plan your interruption window for that time.
You can announce to coworkers when you are available by emailing them or posting a sign in your workspace.

, Keeping your work area organized is not only good for eliminating things that distract you, but itâs good for setting the tone for an efficient day of work. If the documents you need are buried in a pile, you lose time searching. Keep everything you need in a specific place so that you can move quickly.Try keeping a small filing cabinet at your desk and creating folder tabs so that you can quickly organize paperwork when it hits your desk.
Get a big desk calendar and keep it on your desk so that you can quickly pencil in meetings and important deadlines.

, Take 30 minutes each morning and plan out your day, including making a list of the most important tasks in order of deadline. Adjust this list throughout the day so that you are continuously tackling the most important tasks first, even if new tasks arrive on your desk throughout the day.For example, if you work in customer service, you may have irate customers calling and emailing even though your boss has you working on a long-term document. You should pause on the document to address the concerns of the customers first.
Update your list so that you donât get off track.

Research jobs related to tourism.,
Evaluate your own skills.,
Look at industry trends.,
Consider your interests.",How to Develop a Career in Tourism1," The tourism industry encompasses many different career opportunities, with varying degrees of experience required. Some examples of these job opportunities include travel planning, serving on resorts and cruise ships, hotel management, and travel writing. Look up travel industry websites and career guides online to get more information. To start, visit the U.S. State Departmentâs website for a list of resources about tourism-related careers in the U.S.: http://www.state.gov/m/fsi/tc/79983.htm.;
, Take stock of the skills you possess that would lend themselves to a career in tourism. The industry is primarily service-based, so strong communication skills and experience in customer service are assets. Organizational skills, such as time management, prioritizing, and planning and coordination, are also beneficial. Consider working on any areas you might be lacking skills that would be needed for a tourism-related career. You can use your existing skills to help you find a job in the tourism industry. Being able to speak a foreign language, for example, may lead you to a job translating for tourists.

, Looking at trends in the tourism industry is a good way to evaluate the current job market, as well as future job opportunities that may be available. Tourism-related websites have created new job opportunities in the industry, ranging from content writing to website design. Aiming for a job in the growing internet component of the industry is a way to stay ahead of the curve at this juncture., Think about your own particular interests in order to narrow your choices within the tourism industry. Long hours are often an inevitable part of tourism-related work, so you should make sure that your job reflects your passion and engages your interest. If you are an avid writer, for example, consider a position writing for travel websites, books, or magazines; if you enjoy interacting with people, opt for a position in a hotel, resort, or tourist attraction.

Tell your boss about your need to stay focused.,
Alert coworkers to your need to focus.,
Recruit coworkers who can assist you.,
Be courteous and tactful in all interactions at work.",How to Complete a High Volume Workload2," Although your boss is the one who likely assigned you a heavy workload in the first place, keeping them informed about your time constraints will help them understand so that they donât give you work that distracts you. Be polite and ask for their input on your workload so that you maintain good terms with them.Be courteous by explaining to your boss that you would like to work on their new assignment, but that your current deadline prevents it. Offer to work on it at another time, or refer them to a coworker you trust to do a good job.
Remember to stay flexible with your boss. If they ask you to work on a different project because the deadline is sooner than yours, be open to that distraction. Count it as part of your scheduled interruptions.

, Donât just put up a sign on your cubicle telling your coworkers to leave you alone. Send out an email or tell them face-to-face so that no animosity develops. Explain that you have a specific time frame each day for taking interruptions, and ask them to respect your daily schedule.

, You may be able to outsource some of the work in your high volume workload by finding coworkers who are qualified. You may want to find a coworker who can do tasks that you find difficult, or find coworkers you can pass the easy work to.


Make sure whoever you recruit has a strong work ethic and has no trouble following the daily schedule you are implementing to stay on task.

, Remember that you want to maintain a pleasant work environment because disgruntled coworkers can add to your stress and distract you. To do this, be polite and kind as much as you can in your interactions.


When a coworker disregards your scheduled interruption time frame and barges in when you are especially focused, resist the impulse to be rude. Instead, say something like, âYea, I understand what youâre saying, but Iâm just focused on this project right now. Could I chat with you on my lunch break?â

Be aware that you are probably stressed.,
Allow yourself to take breaks.,
Plan rewards for yourself.,
Stop thinking about work when you go home.,
Take safety precautions.",How to Complete a High Volume Workload3," When youâre working on a high volume workload, you are likely under a lot of pressure. You may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to conquer. Eventually the stress will make you want to quit, resulting in burnout. To prevent it, you need to reduce the stress.Symptoms of stress manifest in your mind, body, emotions, and behaviors. You can spot stress with symptoms like lack of memory, rapid heartbeat, change in eating habits, irritability, a sense of loneliness, and many more., To help prevent burnout, take mini breaks throughout the day. These can be technology breaks, such as stepping away from your desk so that no one can contact you for a brief moment. Breaks can also be switching to a different task for a short time. Breaks are good. Consider taking one every hour.

, Promising yourself you will take a break at a certain point in a project can help you maintain the motivation you need to finish the job. But you can think bigger than just daily rewards. Plan a vacation or weekend trip to give you something to look forward to.


You can also reward yourself by planning to do something creative at the end of the work day, or plan a weekly trip to the gym or out with friends., Try to leave work behind when you go home for the day. Set boundaries with your boss and coworkers so that they do not contact you when you are at home, or get a separate work phone and turn it off once you get to your house.


Practice relaxation techniques on your way home so that by the time you get to the door, you are much more calm.
You can try breathing techniques to slow your heart beat, or place aromatherapy in your car if you drive.
If you ride public transportation or carpool, try reading or listening to a book or magazine to help you forget about your work day.

, It can also be stressful to have to think about your physical safety and that of your coworkers while you are working on a high volume work load if your job requires physical labor. Set up safety precautions so that you can remove that stressor from your work environment.


Follow all the safety guidelines that your company recommends and poll your coworkers on a regular basis to make sure that they are also maintaining them.
If your company is a bit remiss in safety precautions, institute some yourself.

Apply for an entry-level position.,
Consider getting a tourism-related degree.,
Apply for an internship.,
Improve your job-related skills.,
Find a career mentor.",How to Develop a Career in Tourism2," If you are just starting out in the tourism industry, look for an entry-level job that has fewer educational or training requirements. Such positions may include being a server or customer service representative in a hotel, hostel, casino, or other tourist attraction. The experience earned may be valuable for other positions in the industry, and this kind of work can be undertaken while you pursue further training., If you wish to further your training qualifications, consider getting a degree in something like travel and tourism management, tourism and hospitality management, or tourism and event management from a college or university (usually in a schoolâs hospitality or business departments).Programs will range in scope between institutions, but generally encompass courses in human resources, financial strategies, media relations, and facilities management. Some programs offer (or require) internships with tourism-related companies before graduation.Some careers available to individuals with this training are:


travel agents
convention and event planners
travel coordinators
lodging managers

, Tourism-related internships are available for travellers looking to gain work experience in the hospitality and tourism sector. Some organizations may partner with universities to provide accredited placements, while others offer these internships regardless of work or academic experience. In many cases, you will have to pay to participate in these internships; costs will usually have to do with:travel arrangements
accommodations
food
transport
emergency support
a certificate of completion

, Consider working on career-related skills that could benefit you in a tourism industry career, such as accounting, word processing, or website design. Take classes if possible, or invest time in teaching yourself with the aid of books, manuals, or reputable online resources. While they are very useful in the tourism sector, many of these skills are universally valuable in the job market., Seek out a mentor who can teach you about the tourism industry and provide guidance on your career path. Look for mentors at business associations in your area, community groups, non-profit organizations, or consider friends or family who have experience in tourism or similar industries. Be direct in expressing your interest in developing a mentoring relationship and ask to meet with them to discuss this possibility.For example, you could say: ""I admire your work and I would benefit greatly from your guidance with respect to my career. Would you be willing to meet with me to discuss being my mentor?""

"
"
Join a professional association for people in the industry.,
Learn another language.,
Aim for a promotion.",How to Develop a Career in Tourism3," Look into joining a professional association for travel and tourism, which could include any organization dedicated to stimulating and improving the industry. This can be a way to network and gain contacts that may benefit you in your tourism career. Becoming a member of this kind of association will grant you access to events, conferences, and lectures relevant to the industry.


Visit the U.S. travel associationâs website for an example of a professional tourism association: https://www.ustravel.org/membership/member-benefits


, Multilingualism may be a tremendous asset to you in the tourism industry. Even a basic understanding of a second or third language will allow you to break the ice and communicate with visitors, fellow travellers, or other contemporaries you may interact with at work. As an added bonus, knowing another language can earn you between 8-20% more in your job.

Sign up for a language class, or simply study language books or websites to teach yourself a new language., Invest in your career growth by aiming for a promotion at your tourism-related job. Act professionally at all times, talk yourself up, and ask for more responsibility at work. Be positive and helpful, and show initiative whenever possible (e.g. coming up with a creative solution for a problem instead of asking for assistance).Establish a friendly relationship with your boss and express your interest in moving up in the company, emphasizing your skills, progress in your position, and recent career accomplishments.

Get an objective look on the situation.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.,
Use the situation as motivation.",How to Control Your Emotions at Work1," If you are worried about your job or your performance, you may feel overwhelmed and anxious. While some things are within your control, other things are not. Take a step back and assess the situation before reacting.Are you concerned about the future of your job? What things are within your control, and what things are not? Focus on what you can control, rather than worrying about the things you can't. For example, think about a recent change in upper management. While this may change things about work, focus on what you can do to make the company and your work stronger.
Are you stressed about how others view your work? Are you fearful that you'll not meet expectations? Think about if it is pressure that you've put on yourself. For example, you think that taking a 45-min lunch looks bad if you see other co-workers working through their lunch. Think about what is company policy. If you're allowed an hour-long lunch each day, avoid feeling anxious about this right.
Look at what has worked in the past. Identify projects, people, or situations that help to ease your worry at work. Make sure to talk with trusted co-workers about any concerns you have about your job. Other people can be more objective about your situation.;
, Feelings of sadness, anxiety, or anger may be triggered when a difficult situation triggers negative thoughts. You may feel out of control emotionally when those negative thoughts become intrusive and persistent.Identify when negative thoughts occur. For example, after giving a presentation at work, you notice that more people are engaged in listening to your co-worker's presentation than yours. You then have a negative thought to yourself, ""I'll never be as good at presentation as my co-worker.""
The negative thought triggers negative feelings. In this example, you may feel sad, depressed, and rejected.
Learn to replace and challenge these negative thoughts with more positive thoughts. Instead say to yourself, ""I'm glad that I have this presentation. I'm happy with the effort I made. Next time, I'll find more activities to engage the audience."" Instead of being self-deprecating, you can focus on how to improve and make things better.

, If you see something or someone that causes you frustration and stress, focus on what you can do to make it better. Turn your emotions into motivation for change. See each hurdle as an opportunity for growth.Avoid taking the situation too seriously. Whether small issues or big problems, focus your energy on how to be resilient in this instance, and not feel let down.
For example, let's say that another co-worker gets a promotion instead of you. Think about what you can do in the future in order to get that next promotion.
Every success comes with mistakes. Life is a process of learning. Avoid being too hard on yourself, and gain some perspective on the good things you have in life.

Listen to your body.,
Step away from the situation.,
Practice breathing or visualization exercises to calm down.",How to Control Your Emotions at Work2," Oftentimes your body will react faster than your brain when you are under emotional stress. Rather than trying to ignore these sensations, pay close attention to them. Notice these physical signs of anxiety, stress, or anger:Rapid heartbeat or increased blood pressure
Muscle tension or shaking
Sweating
Nausea or upset stomach
Headaches
Clenching your jaw or teeth

, When you feel yourself in mind and body getting angry, it may be best to step away from the situation. Try to excuse yourself if possible. Try also giving yourself some physical space between you and the emotionally-charged situation.Consider stepping away from your desk or office. Take a walk around the office. Get outside for a few minutes for fresh air.
Excuse yourself to the restroom. Being in the restroom may give you the opportunity to separate yourself from a difficult meeting or situation.
If there is a one person who is specifically upsetting you, ask to speak with them at a later time. Try not to get into an argument with them in that moment.

, At your desk or in a private space at your work place, try stress reduction exercises that are helpful in calming the mind. This will help to lower your blood pressure and redirect your negative thoughts away from anger. Try deep breathing exercises. One example of this is to slowly inhale your breath for five seconds. Hold your breath and close your eyes for five seconds. Then very slowly exhale for five to ten seconds. Repeat this exercise multiple times until you feel less upset.
Engage in visualization exercises. Close your eyes. Imagine a comforting and safe space. It can be real or imaginary. As you imagine this place, think about the colors, smells, sounds, and sensations. This place should be a relaxing and soothing place that makes you feel better.

"

Assess your workplace culture.,
Value emotions in moderation.,
Create a relaxing personal space at work.",How to Control Your Emotions at Work3," Each workplace may have a different way of operating. Some environments may be more supportive than others of their employees. Instead of getting angry or depressed, evaluate if this workplace is a good fit for you.If you feel like things aren't getting any better at your job, consider looking for work elsewhere. Do your job search only after work, and outside of work time.
If you feel like you need to keep this job, but are frustrated at the same time, identify people or things in your workplace that can make your daily grind less nerve-racking. For example, allocate time each day to spend time with co-workers that make you feel better. Or, consider using your lunch break to walk around the office.

, While you may not want to be seen as emotionally volatile, avoid making a complete reversal by acting like an emotionless robot. Suppressing your emotions and bottling them up will likely lead to negative feelings about your life and work in the long run.Focus on tackling your emotions in the moment, rather than suppressing them.
Make an effort to show that you are working towards happiness and betterment, rather than just ""getting by"" each day.
See your negative emotions as transitory. If you fixate on them, or suppress them, then they stick with you. If you try to better yourself in a positive way, then they seem less persistent.

, If you have your own desk or cubicle, use this space to make yourself feel more at home. A clean and organized space can also help to reduce stress and anxiety. Use the workspace available to make them more friendly and relaxing.Decorate your desk or office with things that you enjoy. Put mementos that help to remind you of happy memories from home or work. Have photos of friends and family.
Create spaces that are organized and clear of clutter. Clutter can make you feel more stressed.
Put up a picture or two of a place that makes you feel happy. Focus your attention on this picture when you need to calm down and feel less stressed.

Take care of your body.,
Get emotional support.,
Write in a journal.,
Spend more time with friends and family who encourage you.",How to Control Your Emotions at Work4," Treat your body with love and care. You will be better able to handle difficult situations when you're rested and physically well. What you eat, drink, and do outside of work hours really does impact how you emotionally respond at work.Exercise. Go to the gym. Take fitness classes. Walk, bike, and hike.
Sleep well. Give your body the rest it needs. Make sure to sleep for as long as your body needs to feel rested.
Make healthy choices. Limit junk food and caffeine when possible. Choose water and healthy snacks to keep you energized throughout the day. You'll be less cranky when you have a healthy snack to keep your blood sugar stable.
Limit alcohol and other substances. Outside of work, a drink or two may feel like a good way to unwind. Avoid becoming dependent on alcohol or drugs in order to function.

, If you feel like your emotions are getting the best of you, listen to your friends and co-workers if they voice concerns about your emotional well-being. Rather than ignore your emotions, channel them in ways that allow you release your negative energy.Have a good friend that you can trust to talk about what's bothering you.
Consider getting support through counseling. Counselors can help you learn coping skills to keep your emotions in check and how handle stressful work situations with greater tact.
You may have access to free or low-cost counseling via your Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Ask your human resources department for the EAP phone number. The consultation via phone to assess your needs is confidential.

, Get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper. This can help you to focus your energy away from worry, anger, or sadness. Use your journal to process what you're feeling and why.Journaling is an opportunity to figure out what is bothering you. It can help to provide clarity over time.
Write at least three things that you like about yourself and your life every time you write. Make sure to reflect on the positive things, and not just the negative.

, Help to make work-life balance a priority. The more opportunities that you give yourself to appreciate the people you love, the more you feel happy and purposeful at work.


Set aside time each day and week to be with people that make you feel loved and happy.
Call or talk with your friends or family more often. Open up to them about what you're feeling, even if it's not always happy. Be honest and open with them.

A disorderly work area is a work area that can hinder your productivity. If you're constantly struggling to find specific tools or documents in a mountain of clutter, serious work time is being wasted. Only keep items that you use daily out and about - everything else should be squirreled away where it's out of the way but also quickly retrievable.


If you work in an office, arrange your office space and desk so that you can quickly and easily find whatever you need to work. If you don't work in an office, the same principles still apply. For instance, if you work in a bike repair shop, keep your tools clean and organized so that you'll be able to find them instantly when you need them. Almost every work area benefits from being kept clean.






Office workers and other people who handle large numbers of documents should create a filing system that is logical and organized. Keep documents that you use frequently close at hand. Stash other documents according to alphabetical (or some other logical) order.;
, Make sure that you have the supplies and tools needed to do your job. In an office, this means you should have things such as hole-punches, staple removers, calculators, etc. at the ready. Outside of an office setting, the tools are different, but the fundamental principles are the same - have the things you need to work effectively before you have to start working. Scientists working with complex graphing applications and mechanics working with socket wrenches will both benefit from having their tools prepped and ready beforehand.


This also means to make sure you have a good supply of whatever consumable supplies your job requires - staplers need staples, carpenters need nails, teachers need chalk, etc.
Ensure your tools are well-maintained. One essential broken tool can bottleneck the rest of your work flow if you can't proceed without it! Save time in the long run by spending a few moments periodically to clean and maintain your tools.

, If you've been flying by the seat of your pants so far, making any sort of effort to plan out your day will probably increase your working efficiency. To keep a truly effective schedule though, limit yourself to one comprehensive planner (optionally supplemented with one calendar in your office or cubicle for long-term objectives.) Don't needlessly complicate your work by keeping more than one schedule or by scrawling out a huge collection of notes that you'll inevitably lose. You want to be able to look in one specific place to see what you need to do.


Organize each day by creating a ""to do"" list. Begin with the highest priorities of the day so that they are most likely to get done. Put less important tasks at the end the list. Start at the top of the list at the beginning of your work day. If you do not complete the list by the end of the day, tackle the uncompleted items the next day.






Set a time frame and deadline for your most important projects, and be realistic about the length of time they will take. You don't want to set yourself up to fail - it's better to ask for more time at the start of a project, rather than right before it's due.

, Different work places have different distractions - some jobs may come with a particularly talkative coworker who just won't leave you alone. Others might be oppressively silent, causing you to get distracted by even the quietest noises. Do what you must to make sure you can stay focused on your work. If your job allows you to safely listen to music, take an MP3 player to work with you. You might even consider posting notes at your work station notifying coworkers not to distract you. It might seem rude, but it's not - it's a reasonable and effective method to get people to leave you alone while you're working. Remember, you can socialize to your heart's content during breaks and meals.


One very common distraction is spending time on recreational internet sites. One study showed that about two thirds of workers waste at least a little time on websites not related to their work every day. Luckily, most browsers allow you to download free productivity aids that allow you to block problem websites. Search your browser's extension store for ""website blocker"" or ""productivity aid."" You're likely to get at least a few free, effective results.




Other good ways to avoid distraction are by screening your calls (to avoid needless telephone conversations) and minimizing drop-in meetings.







, Oddly, breaks can increase,"" rather than hinder your workplace efficiency. First, breaks offer you much-needed rest. Without this rest, you may become fatigued, working more slowly or with less proficiency. Second, breaks give you a chance to deal with your distractions. Use your breaks to do everything that might otherwise take you away from your work. Do you find yourself daydreaming about a relative you've been meaning to call when you should be working? Call them on your break, eliminating your distraction!

, Big projects can be intimidating - if they're big enough, it's easy to put them off, wasting time on less-important work until you're forced to tackle the entire project right up against the deadline. As an efficient worker, you should do important work first, even when that means doing a small part of a large task. It doesn't feel as rewarding to do a small part of a big task as it does to complete an entire small task, but it's a smart use of your time. In the long run, you'll finish your most important tasks faster if you work on them a little bit every day.


For example, if you've got to make a big presentation in one month's time, set a goal of creating an outline today. It's not terribly time-consuming, so it won't distract you from your other work, but it's an important first step that makes the rest of the process quicker and easier to complete.

, Unless you're at the very bottom of the workplace totem pole, you may have the opportunity to split up particularly repetitive tasks among one or more of your subordinates to save yourself time. Don't give your underlings projects that only you know how to complete satisfactorily. Instead, give them the time-consuming, monotonous tasks that keep you from using your talents on more important work. If you delegate work, remember to follow up with your assistant and give him/her a deadline. Always be gracious with your subordinates when they help you - if they feel like you appreciate them, they'll work hard for you on future projects.


If you're an intern, an entry-level employee, or someone else who's low-ranking in your company, you can still try to divide particularly monotonous work with employees who are at the same level as you (with their permission as well as the permission of your supervisor, of course). If you use a coworker's help, be ready to return the favor!






If you've got a great relationship with your boss, you can even see if he can delegate some of the work to others for you!







, There's a reason everyone hates meetings - according to a 2012 survey, almost half of all respondents consider meetings to be the biggest source of wasted time at work - bigger, even, than time spent on personal and recreational websites.Meetings can be vital for discussing goals and establishing a forward vision. Left unchecked, however, meetings all too often become bloated affairs, eating up hours (or in extreme cases, even days ) of your time without anything important being decided. Here's a few tips to make your meetings as effective as possible:


Establish an agenda before every meeting so that the time set aside is used to its full potential. Include time frames in which certain topics of discussion should be addressed. Stick to your agenda as much as you can - if other topics arise, recommend they be discussed later via a one-on-one office discussion.
Invite the smallest number of people as possible. Keeping your meetings to the bare minimum in terms of attendees reduces the chance that the conversation will veer off-topic. It also keeps everyone who doesn't need to be there at their desks, working, which is overall more productive.
Keep slide presentations to a minimum. There is ample debate about whether slide presentations (PowerPoint, etc.) help or hinder the efficiency of a meeting.This much is clear: If you use slides in your presentation, keep them as concise and informative as possible. Use slides to display pictures and data that can't be conveyed through your speech, not the entire content of your presentation. And don't mess around with animations or transitions, either, as it wastes time.
Finally, as an overarching principle, know what you want to decide before you start the meeting and make that decision as quickly as possible.

, Workplaces can, unfortunately, be terribly stressful places. If tempers flare, address any ill will immediately and directly. This may mean you, the person you're fighting with, or both of you need to make sincere apologies. Do this sooner rather than later. If you let a few fights fester into a grudge, your efficiency will suffer in the long run as you waste time working around this person and avoiding him/her in the workplace. More importantly, you'll be miserable - don't let workplace drama ruin your efficiency and your mood!


Don't be afraid to involve a mediator. Businesses know that drama and hurt feelings can hinder work flow, so many employ people whose specific duties include resolving workplace disputes. Contact your workplace's human resources personnel if you feel frustrated, sad, or scared because of someone else in the workplace.
When all is said and done, you don't have to be friends with a colleague you've argued with - you just have to be able to work with him or her. Be polite and tactful in the workplace, even with people you hate.

, Being tired has never improved the quality of anyone's work. Tiredness can slow your output, dull your performance, and, if you're prone to sleeping spells, seriously embarrass you in important meetings. On top of this, severely insufficient sleep has been correlated with a variety of health problems.Don't fall asleep at your desk or miss work because you've gotten sick - get 7-8 hours of sleep a night to be at your best.


At best, workplace fatigue can be a minor distraction. At worst, it can be a serious safety concern. If you have a job where peoples' safety is at stake (for instance, if you're an air traffic controller or you drive a semi truck), it's imperative that you keep a good sleep schedule.

, Science has shown that a good exercise regimen improves your workplace mood and productivity.This is especially true for sedentary office jobs. If you spend most of your time at work sitting in front of a computer, make special effort to spend a little time every day exercising - not only will it make it easier to sit still at work, but it will make you feel happier, sharper, and more motivated.


If you're starting an exercise routine for the first time, try a moderate workout combining cardio exercise with some strength training.

, If you're trying to improve your working efficiency, you may be tempted to pursue your work with dogged seriousness. Often, this isn't a good idea - you may increase your efficiency in the short term, but if you never allow yourself any pleasure at work, it's easy to burn yourself out, leading to fatigue, stress, and a lack of motivation. Try to keep high spirits - if you feel good at work, you'll be more likely to stay motivated and ambitious. Do small things to improve your mood that won't hinder your productivity - listen to music through headphones, take stretch breaks, or take your laptop to the break room for some peace and quiet.


Make the most of your meal breaks - relish the chance to enjoy good food and tell jokes with your workplace friends.
Use coffee with caution. Coffee can be a fantastic pick-me-up on days when you're feeling especially drained, but if you use it every day, you'll become dependent on it and it will cease to give you any benefits.

, It's easier to work efficiently if you have a good reason to work. If you're occasionally having difficulty getting yourself going, think about the reasons that led you to your job in the first place - your life's goals, your dreams, and your vision for yourself. Try to think of your work as a means to an end - the ""end"" being your ideal vision for your life. If you enjoy your job, try thinking about how your work makes you feel - do you feel fulfilled and accomplished after you've done it?


Think about the good things your work allows you to have. Perhaps you owe your house or your car to the money you've earned through your job, or maybe your job allows you to send your children to school. Also think of your job's ""benefits"" - medical and/or dental insurance for your family, for instance.






Think about the consequences if you don't work. What things will you have to give up if you lose your source of income? In what ways will it affect your family or other people close to you?

, If you've successfully increased your work efficiency, celebrate - you deserve it. It's not easy to lose bad habits and cultivate good ones, so reward yourself for your hard work. Buy yourself a drink after work on Friday, meet with some friends for a night out, or just lay in bed with a book - whatever makes you happy after a long work week, do it. Rewarding yourself increases your feeling of accomplishment, which is an important part of keeping your motivation up.


Your reward doesn't have to be big or grandiose, and it shouldn't be something that's financially irresponsible. Modest, moderate rewards are best. Save the new Rolex for a special occasion.

Getting to work early may help eliminate stress caused by rush-hour commuting, and many people say they feel most productive in the morning. Starting your day early also allows you to leave at a regular time instead of leaving late, thus eliminating stress caused by the thought that your job is taking away your personal time in the evening.;
, Sitting for hours on end in an office chair has not only been shown to increase stress, but it can also cause chronic back pain, carpal tunnel, eye strain and more.Remove these health stressors by getting up from your desk every hour to hour and a half.Look into your state or provincial governmentâs laws regarding rest breaks. Some US states, as well as other national and regional governments, require employers to offer rest breaks in addition to meal breaks., Get out of the office every day for at least 30 minutes. Get some sunlight or take a walk if possible. Otherwise, find something like a good meal or a quiet corner to listen to music or read that can help you disengage with the stress of your morning.Some people choose to do yoga during their lunch break. Finding a private place and bringing a yoga mat to work may help you to stretch out your muscles and focus your thoughts. Meditation, breathing exercise or regular massage can also have the same stress relief effects., If your company offers you vacation time, use it. Whether you take a trip or just relax at home for a few days, using vacation hours is thought to improve productivity, reduce stress, and help mitigate health problems such as heart disease and sleep loss.When you do take your vacation time, disengage fully from work. Do not take work calls, answer work emails, or dedicate time to your job unless it is a true emergency that only you can fix., While can be good to have large goals, you need to be able to break them down into smaller, actionable steps. Create realistic goals by not only envisioning an outcome, but by creating an action plan full of steps you can manage individually to accomplish your goal.Your goal, for example, may be to complete a technical report in 90 days. Break that report down section by section to set daily or weekly goals for yourself. This way, as you check off goals, you will see what you have accomplished, not just what is left to do.
Understand that mistakes and revisions to action plans are common. They can have positive consequences, allowing you to change something when it isnât working. Recognize your mistakes and learn from them, instead of denying them.

, Use a calendar, a pen and pad, an organizer, a pocket calendar, or anything that will help you organize what you need to do, and by when. Tasks and deadlines can get cluttered in your head, and it may help to see them spread out so that you know what to prioritize.Try not to spread your tasks out over a series of lists or calendars. This could cause confusion and add to your stress. Instead, stick to one central list or calendar.

, Calls, emails, and request can come in so fast that sometimes you donât know how you can keep up. Reduce stress caused by juggling too many things at once by creating time to deal with specific distractions. Set aside an hour after lunch to return phone calls and an hour at the end of the day to reply to emails.It may help to create an automated email response stating something like, âThank you for reaching out to me. I have received your email and will respond within 24 hours.â This lets others know their communication has been received, and manages their expectations regarding your response time.
Some calls, email, or requests will be too critical to wait, but by creating a schedule, you can better accommodate high-priority situations without the added stress of responding to numerous other interruptions.

, If you have multiple responsibilities or large projects at your job, do not feel like you have to take them on by yourself. Whether you manage a team or are simply a member of a collaborative group, do not be afraid to ask someone with less on their plate to take on some tasks if you are feeling overwhelmed. If you are nervous about delegating, set up weekly or even daily meetings or check-ins so that you can see how the overall task or project is developing. Just be weary to avoid micromanaging, as this could cause further stress for you and them.

, Voicing excessive grievances and gossiping about your coworkersâ personal matters can cause a negative, stressful attitude in the workplace. If you work with people who do this often, try to abstain.By avoiding petty complaining, you may become more aware of major grievances. Talk with your superiors about unrealistic goals, victimization at work, unfair work practices, or salary questions, when necessary, rather than engaging in gossip that distracts from larger issues.

, Although some professions, such as school teachers, require work after hours, you should make a conscious effort to separate your work from your home life. Ignore work emails and calls, and if you have to work outside of the office, designate specific times meant for that purpose, and donât carry your work beyond that.

If you telecommute or work from home, it is still important to leave work to certain hours of the day. Turn off your computer or forward work calls to your voicemail outside of the office hours you designate for yourself.

, Health professionals suggest you should get at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at least four times a week. This not only helps keep you healthy, it boosts endorphins and helps your brain focus, both of which can relieve stress.For stress relief purposes, the exercise can be moderate rather than intense. Sign up for a class, join an intramural team, or go for a daily power-walk or jog. The important part is to get yourself moving.

, Some people have a tendency during a stressful period is to eat a lot of empty calories and snack heavily between meals. Plan your snacks and meals ahead of time, so that you have the fuel you need to do your work. Pack your lunches and snacks in advance to help you avoid giving into cravings by ordering unhealthy food.Eat or snack before you have any large tasks to accomplish. It is not a good idea to go into a presentation, meeting or important phone call with a completely empty stomach.
Your body responds to a balance of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats in ways that can help you focus and keep you full throughout the day.

, You should dedicate around eight hours of your night to sleep. Count in one hour for relaxing and unplugging your devices before going to bed and one hour to wake up.It is important to disengage from work completely before bed. Make sure to schedule some time to be completely work-free, or work stress could prevent you from getting quality sleep., Some studies have shown that spending time on volunteering or otherwise working on self improvement can directly reduce stress. Look at volunteer organizations and service groups in your community to find something you care about, or consider taking a class to continue your education or learn a new skill.You may opt to take an affordable class at a local community college, or you could look at learning a new skill such as coding or a language with a free online service.
Check with local food pantries, pet shelters, community centers, and other volunteer-based organizations to see who needs help in your area. Alternatively, many organizations look for remote volunteers with special skills to help with online projects.

If youâre scheduled to start on a project the following week, begin working on it. While you may not be completely ready to start on this project (based on information or collaboration with other workers), you can begin to lay the foundations of the project.
If you have meetings scheduled for the future, move them up (if possible).;
, Ask your employer or manager if there is a project theyâd like you to get started on earlier than expected. Theyâll likely be happy that youâre enthusiastic and want to make the most of your time at work. In the end, youâll prove to your employer that you are a hard worker.


Tell your employer youâve finished all of your work.
Say something like âIâve been fairly productive this week, is there something else youâd like me to get to?â
When talking to your boss, make sure to articulate the extenuating circumstances of that particular week. You donât want them to get the idea that they can continue to assign you more or extra work on a regular basis., There are a variety of minor things you can do including catching up with vendors, agencies, or anyone you may do business with outside of your own office.


Schedule meetings.
Order supplies.
Pay bills or submit invoices., A great way to use your free time is to sort through e-mail and voicemail. This is important, since they can both pile up quickly.


Organize your e-mails into folders that can be easily referenced.
Delete spam or trash and unsubscribe to email lists you donât want to be on.
Listen to and delete or save your voicemails., A slow work week is a great opportunity to finish projects youâve been putting off for a while. Chances are, these projects have been haunting you and causing you anxiety for a while. Use this opportunity to get them out of the way for good.


Make a list of projects or work-related chores you want to get out of the way.
Rank your list based on associated pressure or stress.
Work through your list starting with projects that have cause you the most stress.

, Use your spare time by completing performance evaluations or by meeting with your manager to discuss your productivity. By performing these activities, youâll make good and productive use of your slow week.


Schedule a meeting with your supervisor to discuss your productivity or other work related issues. Approach your supervisor and say ""I'd like to schedule a meeting with you if you have time. I want to talk about ways I can be more productive and/or help other employees.""
If youâre in a supervisory role, start work on performance evaluations. While evaluations might not be due for several weeks or even a couple of months, you should be able to get started on some aspect of them., Many jobs require employees to complete some sort of continuing education. If your job does not, it is very likely that your employer would encourage you to attend a trade convention, conference, or something similar.


Start work on certification. Depending on your field, profession, or trade, you may need to secure or renew certifications.
Attend a seminar or conference during the week. You might also be able to use your slow week to attend a seminar, conference, or a trade convention. At these events, youâll be able to network with other professionals, secure education, or promote your product or services.
Use your downtime to complete continuing education course requirements remotely.
Always inform your boss before leaving the office., A great way to take advantage of a slow period and to promote efficiency is to clean your workspace. Your workspace is usually one of the things that suffers in your day-to-day work. This is a bad thing, because it promotes disorganization and hampers your efficiency.


Your slow week is a great way to organize all the papers cluttering your desk. Sort them and file them appropriately.
Clean out your draws of trash, papers that are no longer relevant, or files that are misplaced., Shadowing or observing an experienced coworker for a day is a great way to use down time and improve efficiency. The likelihood is that youâll learn some skills and techniques from the senior employee and will be able to integrate them into your daily life.


Ask permission from your boss. Say ""I've been very productive lately and I'd like to shadow another employee so I can observe ways to be even more efficient.""
Contact the employee ahead of time. Find a senior employee in your department with who you are already friendly with. Approach them and say ""would you mind if I observed you for a few hours? I think I can learn a lot from you.""
Make sure the employee is someone who has received awards or been recognized by management for superior work., For many organizations, their filing or information storage system is fraught with inefficiencies and other problems. Take advantage of your downtime and improve this system. Chances are, youâll be able to not only make things easier for you in the future, but for the whole office.


Are all the files located in a central area? If not, make a central location to house all the files so they can easily be accessed.
If they already are in a central location, volunteer to weed out the older files to make room for future ones.
Ask management before making any alterations to the file or information storage systems.
Consider adding new and innovative filing solutions like Google Docs."
"
Be on time.,
Complete tasks on your own.,
Adapt quickly to changes.,
Work hard.,
Keep organized.,
Pay attention to detail.",How to Be an Excellent Employee1," Punctuality is important. No one wants to work with am employee who's consistently late. Make sure you arrive to work, work meetings, and other obligations on time.""To be early is to be on time"" should be a mantra you live by. Try to get to work 5 to 10 minutes early each day. Arrive at meetings a little before things are scheduled to start. This will show your boss that you take your obligations seriously. He or she will be impressed to see you always running a little ahead of schedule.
In the morning, give yourself more time than you think you need to get ready. If you normally take 20 minutes to shower, give yourself half an hour. If you think breakfast will take about 15 minutes, set aside 20 minutes to eat.
Always take more time than necessary for your commute. Things like traffic and train delays should not result in you running late to work.;
, Your boss wants an employee who can get the job done without excessive handholding or coddling. Strive to be autonomous in your work. Complete tasks on your own, without asking superiors for assistance.Pay attention during training. Take notes if necessary, and study them at home as if you were prepping for a big test. You want to know all the basics of how to do your job so you won't end up confused later on.
If you're unsure of something, try to figure it out yourself first. Before going to a superior with a question, see if there's a way you can figure out the problem on your own. Is there an employee handbook that may answer your question? Can you search for potential solutions on the internet? If you're able to identify and solve a problem without asking for help, your boss will be impressed.However, you should ask questions if you're still unsure of something after searching for a solution on your own. While your boss wants employees that can work solo, you don't want to risk making a mistake. This could reflect more poorly on you than simply asking for help when you need it. Just try to minimize how often you come to your boss or other workers with an issue.

, Changes are a part of any office dynamic. Employees who are able to adapt to changes fast are very desirable. In the event of a change in policy or procedure, try to adjust to the new routine as quickly as possible.Ask questions and take notes when something new is being explained to you. Try to understand new information right away so you can smoothly get back to your job with changes in mind.
Be willing to learn. Many employees will complain about, say, a new computer system at work. Try to be the employee with a positive, excited attitude regarding changes. See a shift in work dynamic as an opportunity to learn something new and diversify your resume., It seems obvious, but old-fashioned hardwork is among the most desirable qualities in a job candidate. When you're in the office, pay attention to your job. Focus all your energy on completing the task at hand in an efficient manner. Employers want employees who are hardworking and produce results.Work to see concrete results every day. Try to tune out distractions when you're at your desk working on a job or project. Avoid taking excessively long breaks or chatting with other employees when you should be working.
Many employees feel schmoozing and getting close to higher ups is the way to the top. While being friendly with your boss can help, employers want hard workers above anything else. Focus on your work over the politics of the office.

, Organization is the foundation of efficient work. Your boss will be impressed if you're a well-organized person, as your organizational skills will benefit your place of work.Keep a planner or calendar at your desk, keeping track of deadlines, meetings, and other aspects of your schedule.
Set personal goals for yourself. If your boss assigns you a project, break the project down into chunks. Set manageable mini-deadlines for yourself in the weeks leading up to the project's final deadline.
Stay up-to-date on e-mail, returning e-mails within 24 hours. It can help to make a list in a notebook of e-mails you need to return. When you have a spare 15 minutes, work on returning e-mails.

, If you've ever browsed a job-board, you'll know lots of employers say they're looking for someone ""detail-oriented"" to fill a position. This means employers want employees who are able to focus on work. In your own place of work, try to be a detailed-oriented employee.A good way to increase your attention to detail is by doing one task at a time. When you have a list of 10 things to do for a workday, do not think ahead when you're working on the first item on the list.
If you need to call a client to set up a lunch meeting, all your energy should be focused on talking to that client. Make sure you get all the details down. What days are best for the client? What kind of food does he or she prefer? Does the client want you to bring anything to the meeting? Keep yourself in the present moment. If you start thinking about the press release you have to write when you get off the phone, you may forget important details.

Create a sick plan.,
Delegate tasks.,
Plan meals ahead of time.,
Make the most of your family time.,
Take some time for you, outside of working and parenting.,
Nurture your adult relationships.",How to Balance Work and Parenting,"


Keep a calendar that you use for both career and family. This puts equal priority on both schedules, and enables you to make plans with both schedules in mind.
Follow the same routine each day. When your children know exactly what to expect and what is expected of them, it is much easier to keep them on task and acting autonomously, which can be a time-save and a stress-reducer, especially when you're in a hurry.
Prepare for mornings the night before. Avoid time-consuming morning debates by picking the following day's outfits before bed, and lessen the morning hustle by pre-packing lunches and backpacks.
Take advantage of the earliest part of the day. The few hours before your children wake up are great for personal time, and can be used to exercise, read, shower or just enjoy a cup of coffee.;
, Even working from home only a few hours a week can provide you with the extra time you may need to spend with your children and/or catch up on housework, especially when you consider drive time.

,


Make it a point to help your children with their homework. Not only does this promote their academic well-being, but it is also quality time spent together.
Use sick or personal days to attend school functions and field trips.
Combine work and parenting by volunteering your professional skills to the PTA. For example, if you are a chef, then you may volunteer to donate pastries to the bake sale, or if you are a bookkeeper, you may offer to be the PTA treasurer. Focus on things you can do even if your work schedule doesn't allow for you to be at the school in person.

, Having a personal relationship with your children's caregiver can relieve a lot of the stress associated with working and parenting. The more involved you are with your children's home away from home, the less you worry about them when you can't be with them.


Choose your caregiver carefully. It is important that you and the person who will be watching your children while you are at work have similar child-rearing philosophies. This provides consistency and stability for the children, and reinforces your home-based parenting efforts.
Communicate openly and regularly about any behavioral issues you notice your children having at home, and work with your caregiver to formulate a plan for countering problem behavior on both fronts.
Visit the childcare facility on a regular basis, even when you are not there to pick up or drop off the kids, just to stay involved and aware of what your children's day is like.
Contribute things like games and snacks, and volunteer to help when you can.

, When your child gets sick, it is important that you are able to ensure your child's care and handle it in a way that does not threaten your work reputation or position. Prepare for such occurrences in the following ways:

Save some of your own sick days for when you have a sick child.






Ask your boss about bringing work home in the case that you have to leave work to pick up a sick child. That way, you may be able to avoid missing valuable work hours.






If your childcare provider does not accept sick children, then arrange for a local caregiver who can come to your home on an on-call basis.







, Lessen your load by assigning household chores to each family member, making the children responsible for their own personal hygiene (showers, brushing teeth, fixing hair, etc.) and requesting that each family member cook 1 night of the week. Just be sure to keep age-appropriateness in mind.

, Try these techniques to save on time and effort:


Use the crock pot to slow-cook meals while you are at work.
Double the recipe when you make dinner, then freeze the extra in an airtight container until you are ready to bake it.
Make a casserole the night before, then reheat it in the oven when you get home from work.

, In order to balance work and parenting, try to leave your work at work and keep your focus on family when you are at home. This may mean turning off your cell phone, not checking your email, scheduling family activities, making it a point to eat dinner together, turning the television off and/or talking about how your day went.

, Dedicate a regular block of time just for doing whatever it is you feel like doing. By taking a break from your day-to-day responsibilities, you not only rest your mind, but also rejuvenate yourself for when it's time to get back to your duties.

, If you are married or attached, it is important that you and your partner engage in enjoyable activities outside of the responsibilities associated with working and parenting. Additionally, making time to socialize with your peers is an important part of staying balanced.

Go into work with passion.,
Think creatively.,
Work on being upbeat.,
Be honest.,
Take risks.",How to Be an Excellent Employee2," It's hard to be an excellent employee if you lack passion. If you're simply suffering through work for 8 hours a day, this will show up in your attitude and performance in subtle ways. Try to go into work each day with a sense of passion and excitement.Focus on the positive aspects of your job. Say you're a copywriter for a non-profit. You may find some of the material you have to write a little silly or corny. However, think about the bigger picture. While the wording in a recent press release may sound saccharine to you, it could result in more donations, allowing your company to do more good in the world.
Authentic passion is hard to fake. If you're in a job you do not feel strongly about, consider looking for a different job. It's very hard to be focused and committed when you feel you're in the wrong career.

, Employers love employees who are able to creatively problem solve. In any given situation, you should be looking for new and innovative solutions. A creative employee is an invaluable asset to any company.

Creativity can be hard to cultivate. However, there are ways to amp your creative side. As you go through your day-to-day tasks, periodically pause and think, ""Is there a more efficient way I could be doing this?"" You should always be on the lookout for creative solutions to office problems, finding ways to make things run smoother.
Do not be shy. If you have an idea on how to improve things, approach your boss respectfully. Even if he or she passes on your idea, employers appreciate employees who take initiative., A positive attitude is contagious. Good employees come to work with a fresh perspective each day, eager to do their best. Try to come in each day feeling positive. This will reflect well on you and make you a valued employee.


Try to have a ""half glass full"" mentality. Come to into work looking at each day as a new opportunity to grow, change, and learn. If you're in a bad mood, this will show up in your performance.Practicing self care outside of work can affect your personality. Strive to eat right, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. If you're taking care of yourself physically, this will improve your emotional attitude.

, Many employees are inclined to talk themselves up to gain favor. While it's good to be confident, sometimes confidence veers on dishonestly. Be honest about yourself and your capabilities. Self-criticism provides you with an opportunity to grow and learn. Employers want ambitious employees who will push themselves to succeed.Do not be self-depreciating, however, as this can come off as having a negative attitude. If you don't know how to do a task, don't say, ""I'm too stupid to figure that out."" Instead, say something like, ""I've never run Google Analytics before, but I would love the chance to learn how if you have a few minutes to show me.""

, Employers want employees who will continue moving up. No one wants someone who's content to stay in the same position for years. Be bold and take risks. Write down a list of 10 things you would do at work if you knew failure was not a possibility. Then, try to complete that list anyway. Not all of your pursuits will be a roaring success, but chances are you will reach some goals along the way. Your boss will be impressed that you took the initiative to push yourself out of your usual comfort zone."
"
Help motivate others.,
Advocate on behalf of your co-workers.,
Practice good communication skills.,
Avoid office gossip.,
Give credit to co-workers.",How to Be an Excellent Employee3," You don't just want to focus on yourself at work. Make an effort to motivate other employees. Most jobs involve a lot of teamwork, so boosting morale is vital in a good employee.


As stated, a positive attitude is contagious. If a co-worker seems down or off, try to put a positive spin on things. If everyone is stressed out because of a looming due date, say something like, ""This is an opportunity to really test our dedication.""
Be willing to help others out. If you see someone who looks confused and lost, politely ask if they need a helping hand. You can help others achieve their goals by offering them guidance with their own work., Remember, teamwork is important. It isn't all about you. Your boss will be impressed if you act on your company's best interest rather than your own personal ambitions. If you're on a short list to go to a conference, but know a co-worker is more knowledgable on the subject, mention this to your boss. Say something like, ""I know you're deciding between me and Natalie for that conference this fall. I appreciate being considered for the opportunity, but I think Natalie would do better than me."", If you want to be an excellent employee, you need to be able to communicate effectively. When talking to your boss and co-workers, make sure you listen and are understood.


Practice active listening. Smile, nod, and offer other non-verbal cues to indicate you're paying attention to the speaker. When the speaker finishes talking, reiterate what they just said to make sure you understood completely. Do not think of your response while another person is talking. Simply listen and try to understand.
If you're having a conflict, think back to other times you had to navigate a difficult or awkward situation. How did you handle the situation? How did you help smooth out a conflict? Use the skills you learned from past personal or professional issues in the workplace., Gossiping says a lot more about you than it does about the other person. If you gossip about your boss or co-workers, people will view you as distrustful. There's also always a good chance what you say about someone in private can get back to that person. If you hear people gossiping, it's best to disengage. Offer non-committal responses like, ""Sorry you feel that way"" and simply move on., Once again, show your boss and co-workers that you're willing to share the spotlight. Instead of being jealous at another person's accomplishments, give them credit. Success is not finite. If someone achieves something, instead of being envious offer them a sincere congratulations."
"
Establish your reputation.,
Decline the discussion.,
Stay away from certain people.",How to Avoid Talking Politics at Work1," Make sure people at work know that youâre not someone who will talk about politics. By doing this, youâll minimize the chance of people purposefully including you in a conversation about politics.


Donât entertain conversation about politics.
Never share your political affiliation or thoughts on politics. The instant you divulge this information, people may think youâre open to political conversation.
Display a humorous sticker or sign near your office that says something like âNo Politics Hereâ or something similar.;
, The simplest way to avoid talking about politics is to simply decline inclusion in any conversation about it. By declining to participate, youâll avoid the possibility of getting caught in a controversial discussion that could cause you problems in the future.


When the subject of politics comes up, simply say âWhile this sounds interesting, I donât talk about politics publicly.â
After youâve declined, make a comment that smooths your departure from the discussion and eases everyoneâs feelings. For instance, say âYou guys are great! When the conversation comes back to the sports, let me know.â
If someone ever insists that you participate, politely decline and excuse yourself. Say âThank you, but no thanks. See you later!â, Perhaps the best way to avoid discussion of politics is to just stay away from people who may engage in discussion about it. By steering clear of these people, youâll greatly minimize discussions that you may become a part of.


Avoid socializing or talking about your personal life with anyone who constantly talks about politics. If you donât, chances are theyâll try to involve you in one of their discussions at some point.
Steer clear of people who talk about politics during election time. This might be as easy as avoiding the break room or walking a longer route to the parking lot to stay away from a part of the office.
Keep your distance from people who are vocal about sharing drastically different political viewpoints than your own. These people may say things to get a rise out of you, and to provoke you into debate over an issue you feel strongly about."
"
Identify conflict.,
Find out reasons.,
Identify the type of conflict.,
Understand what social scientists say about conflicts.,
Avoid the conflict altogether.,
Avoid making accusations and work to keep your tone neutral.,
Cope with the stress conflicts cause.",How to Avoid Conflict at Work," Dealing with a conflict at work can be tough. The aim is to to get your way but not at the expense of working relationships you are going to need to rely on later. Resolving conflicts is better than trying to âwinâ because this helps people on both sides feel as though their concerns were valid and considered. Reaching fair compromises will help to eliminate stress that will ultimately lower productivity levels.;
, Any environment where people are charged and emotionally invested in the events taking place has room for conflict to happen. People are inevitably bound to have a disagreement on how things should be done which can lead to issues between those with differing opinions. You might also find that some people in your workspace are simply difficult to get along with or like to cause trouble for their own amusement which can lead to conflicts when feelings get hurt.

, A very common conflict in the workplace stems from those that feel that their efforts are being under-appreciated. If someone is taking credit for your work or your suggestions are being ignored it can lead to conflict with the person causing this disagreement.


Frustration is also a very common source of conflict. If someone received a promotion or bonus it can lead to jealousy, particularly if others feel as though these benefits were earned unfairly. Disagreements in the workplace can also be personal.
When you see the same people every day their habits can become irritating. If someone is messy, loud or confrontational it can make it difficult to focus on work.

, Ultimately, conflict in the workplace is bad for business so social scientists are frequently called in to help people understand the cause of conflicts and how to resolve them. Scientific studies suggest that 37 percent of employees feel as though they are bullied at their job which is the ultimate source of their conflict issues.It has also been suggested that people consider a disagreement in the workplace to be a conflict if one of their basic human needs is not being met.Understanding the emotion behind the conflict and what is ultimately causing the disagreement can help you find the optimal solution for releasing the tension.

, Itâs always best to address a conflict sooner rather than later. This helps to avoid excess tension that can build up over time. Start by asking nicely if you donât understand why someone has behaved a certain way or if they can change their behavior.

, In many cases, people do not realize they have caused offense when conflicts arise. Apologize for any part you may have played in the situation.


Try to set a goal for resolving the conflict with the other person. Perhaps you want to communicate more, get more personal space in the office or have quiet when on the phone. If both parties understand the goals, it is easier for everyone to work toward common ground.

, Dealing with conflicts at work can be stressful but you cannot let this impact your ability to do your job. It is perfectly healthy to vent your frustrations, but work to do this away from the office where there is no risk of negative comments being overheard or passed back to others. This will only make the conflict worse. If you are having trouble resolving a conflict and it has gone on for some time, consider working with a mediator to help dissolve some of the tension.

"
Make a joke.,
Refocus the conversation on a related topic.,
Avoid forcing a conversation change.",How to Avoid Talking Politics at Work2," A simple way to redirect a conversation away from politics is by making a joke that is completely apolitical. By making a joke, youâll make it easier to change the conversation and lighten the mood.


Consider joking about a well-known topic of popular culture, like the New England Patriotâs Deflategate. For example, say something like ""You know, I'd rather vote for Tom Brady than either of the candidates.""
Craft your joke so itâs not offensive and does not involve any other taboo conversation subjects, like race, ethnicity, or religion.
Think about making a humorous comment about an experience of your own., During a conversation about politics, youâll likely find the opportunity to subtly change the topic of conversation. By changing the topic of conversation, youâll be able to avoid directly talking about politics.


Change the conversation based on a related fact. For example, if someone is talking about a candidate from Iowa, share your experience about traveling through the state. Consider talking about how you visited the giant ball of yarn or the baseball field depicted in Kevin Costnerâs Field of Dreams.
Redirect the conversation based on timing. For instance, if an election is coming up try to change the topic of the conversation to what youâre doing on election night or the weekend before the election. You might just find that other people will be more interested in talking about recreational activities than politics., Sometimes your redirecting may not work. When this happens, you want to withdraw from the conversation so you donât appear as if youâre trying to force a change in discussion.


Time any redirect appropriate. Make sure there is a smooth natural transition in the conversation before trying. For instance, wait until someone has spoken and there is a pause in the conversation.
Never interrupt someone or cut them off when they are about to speak.
Donât change the topic of conversation to something completely about yourself. Your coworkers may think youâre self-obsessed."
"
Be sensitive to inflammatory comments.,
Stay level-headed.,
Be polite and nonconfrontational.",How to Avoid Talking Politics at Work3," An important element of managing any office conversation is to be aware when people make insensitive, hateful, or inflammatory comments when talking about politics. Simply being present might attach you to those comments.


Never engage or debate someone about an inflammatory or controversial topic. Instead, shut the conversation down. Say something like âI think we should end this conversationâ
Donât be afraid to let the person know their comments are inappropriate. Say something like âHey John, youâre insulting some people we actually work with.â
Speak to human resources or management if a person shares hate speech at work. Let them know you are concerned about these comments and how they may offend others in the office., One of the biggest dangers of talking politics at work is allowing yourself to get passionate or emotional during a conversation. Thus, you always need to make sure you stay calm and rational.


Always avoid discussing things you feel passionate about â your passions may get the better of you and draw you into a larger conversation.
If someone interjects political comment into regular conversation, donât take the bait. Be strong and excuse yourself from the conversation. Say something like: âExcuse me, Sonya, I have some copies to run off before lunch.â
Always think before responding to someone. A good tactic is to count to ten before responding to anything that you feel strongly about.
Focus on your goal to avoid discussion of politics. Constantly remind yourself â and others â of your position by letting them know you donât talk politics in public., If youâve found yourself trapped in a conversation about politics, youâll need to carefully negotiate your way out of it. While youâre finding a way to redirect the conversation, you need to make sure you are polite and nonconfrontational.


Keep your comments short and noncommittal. This works well if youâre in a conversation that includes a group of people.
Maintain positive body language. Make sure you smile. In addition, keep a loose and relaxed posture. Avoid crossing your arms and taking a defensive posture.
If you for some reason do find yourself answering or rebutting someoneâs comments, be polite. Lead with a comment like âI think thatâs a valid position, but I disagreeâ â then explain why you disagree.
Never resort to insults or personal attacks. Keep the conversation as theoretical and impersonal as possible."
"
Identify if you have an abusive boss or coworkers.,
Notice any illegal or unsafe activities.,
Ask yourself if it is performance-related.,
Consider if it has to do with the nature of the work.",How to Be Successful in a Stressful Business Environment1," Your job may be unnecessarily stressful due to a hostile work environment created by an abusive boss or coworkers. Is your boss a narcissist, manipulating others and taking credit for their work? Do they use fear and intimidation to bully employees? Are you or others sexually harassed or treated differently based on your race, gender, or age?These issues should not be ignored. Keep a record of any incidents. Talk to your company's human resources department or, if there is no HR department, talk to a supervisor or higher up, or a union representative. If that isn't an option, talk to a lawyer. Simply threatening to sue might be enough to get things to change.
An abusive boss or any form of harassment is not okay. You may have grounds to pursue legal action against them.
Leaving your job for a healthier environment is also a possibility. Sometimes the entire culture of a company is toxic, and you are better off making an exit and going somewhere with a better environment.;
, Are you being asked to falsify logs, documents, data or otherwise commit fraud? Do you have a coworker asking you to cover for them and lie about something? Do you notice clear safety violations in your workplace, but management refuses to correct them when confronted? These, along with things like selling of controlled substances, theft, and harassment should be reported. If management is not aware of these problems, speak to them or the HR department. If management is part of the problem, then it may be necessary to involve the authorities.

If your safety is at risk, get out of the situation as soon as possible. Tell your boss you won't work in unsafe conditions.
Make sure that the law is in fact being violated before taking action. In some cases, the management may not be aware that the activity is occurring or may not know they are violating a law. The first step is to try and be collaborative when dealing with the issue, especially if you want to continue to work there.You might say something like, ""I'm happy to work the overtime if you want, but remember I'm non-exempt, so the company is required by federal law to pay for it.""If nothing changes, weigh your options. Unfortunately, pursuing legal action against a company may have a negative impact on your career. Try consulting an employment attorney to find out your options if you decide to become a whistle-blower while at the company or after you leave. You will likely need to take very specific actions to protect yourself.There are laws against retaliation and whistleblowing.

, You may be stressed out at work because you realize you haven't had the appropriate training to do your job well or efficiently. Or perhaps you are expected to do a certain amount of work during an unreasonably short time period. Or perhaps you have no idea what the expectations are â there may be little or no direction, leaving you confused about what needs to get done.

A lack of communication can often turn a workplace toxic. If employees rarely feel like they know what is going on or are the last to hear about decisions that have been made, discuss solutions with your management.A log book, in which new information is available for employees to read at the start of each shift, or daily or weekly meetings to inform employees of any changes could potentially help improve communication.
Ask your boss about receiving additional training or if you can sit down and review the company's objectives.

, Some jobs, like being a first responder or working in an emergency room, are inherently stressful. Ask yourself if your job is, by its nature, stressful. If that's the case, ask yourself if you are willing to live with that. If so, take measures to learn to deal with stress in healthy, constructive ways so that it doesn't interfere with your health and wellbeing."

Draft a strong anti-discrimination statement.,
Provide a list of characteristics protected by state and federal law.,
Describe conduct prohibited by the policy.,
Outline your complaint resolution procedure.,
Specify consequences of violations.,
Provide handbooks and orientation for all new employees.,
Host mandatory refresher courses.,
Work with employees to accommodate them.,
Make educational materials readily available.,
Designate more than one person to handle complaints.,
Document any conversations with your employees regarding an incident of discrimination.,
Take all employee complaints seriously.,
Protect reporting employees' confidentiality.,
Investigate all complaints promptly.,
Follow company policies consistently.",How to Avoid Workplace Discrimination Lawsuits," The beginning of your policy should include a strong statement that the company has no tolerance for discriminatory actions or behavior in the workplace.Let it be known that discriminatory or abusive behavior will not be tolerated in your company, and that all employees have the right to work in a discrimination- and harassment-free environment.In the event an employee complaint does escalate to the point where he or she files a complaint with a state or federal agency, your written policy serves as evidence that you took reasonable care to keep the workplace free of discrimination.Include discrimination in hiring or promotion, and make sure managers and supervisors understand that they cannot discriminate in new hires based on protected characteristics.;
, Make sure your employees know exactly what types of discrimination are unlawful.


Federal law generally protects employees from workplace discrimination on the basis of age, sex, disability, genetic information, national origin, pregnancy, race or skin color, and religion.It's important to check your state's law as well, since some states offer protection against discrimination for classes or groups that are not yet recognized by federal law.
For example, although there is no federal law prohibiting discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation, nearly half of all states and many municipalities have laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.You might want to include a statement at the end of your list that includes protection against ""any other category protected by federal, state, or local law."" This keeps your policy in line with the law and keeps you from having to make changes and reprint your policy manuals every time the law changes.If you are a manager or supervisor, pay close attention to how these characteristics may come into play when you are hiring someone new or terminating someone's employment.For example, if you are looking for a new secretary, you cannot include a statement that you prefer female candidates â even if you are female and believe you get along better with female assistants. Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.

, Provide a list of types of behavior or actions along with examples to help employees better understand the policy.


Keep in mind that some acts that could be considered discriminatory, such as displaying a swimsuit calendar or telling an off-color joke, could be seen as harmless fun to some of your employees.
Make it clear that saying ""I didn't mean anything by it"" or ""it was a joke"" does not constitute a defense to an allegation of discrimination.
Include a statement that the examples you provide are not an exhaustive list.Advise your employees to follow the rule ""when in doubt, leave it out."" If they have any questions about whether something might be offensive or discriminatory, they should err on the side of caution and keep it away from the workplace.

, Employees should know how to report discrimination and what will happen after it is reported.Make sure your policy is simple and straightforward. If employees have to deal with a lot of red tape or jump through hoops to make their concerns known, your policy won't be effective.
Provide reasonable deadlines by which the employee can expect some sort of response or investigation of their complaint.
Include a mechanism through which all sides of the story can be heard, and emphasize that no action will be taken to discipline an employee without a thorough investigation and solid evidence that he or she violated your anti-discrimination policy.
You also might include a list of options available to alleviate the situation during the investigation process. For example, a complaining employee may be able to transfer to another shift or department to remove him or her from the allegedly discriminatory person.
Consider including penalties for filing false or frivolous allegations against other employees. This can prevent people from using the anti-discrimination policy to threaten or manipulate other employees, and sends the message that all employees will be treated fairly in the complaint resolution process.

, Your consequences should be realistic and capable of being implemented for every employee or manager consistently.While a ""three strikes and you're out"" type of policy may be appropriate for unintentional instances of discrimination, you probably should include more severe consequences for intentional or blatant discriminatory acts.
In cases where discrimination cross the line to actual criminal behavior, immediate termination may be the only appropriate sanction.For example, if a male employee followed a female employee into the restroom and fondled her, you have a situation where the female employee could potentially have criminal charges pressed against the male employee. Not only should acts such as this not be tolerated, but anyone who commits such acts should not be allowed to remain on your staff.
You also should include sanctions for acts of retaliation against employees who file discrimination complaints. Retaliation against employees who report discrimination is prohibited by federal law., Make sure employees know from the very beginning what is expected from them and the types of behavior that won't be tolerated.Written handbooks with anti-discrimination policies provide a general awareness of workplace discrimination and how your company deals with it.Written policy manuals are required under the law of many states.Having a uniform orientation program ensures every employee has received the same information regarding the rules of the workplace and your standards of conduct and professionalism.Make sure all new hires understand that the written information contained in their handbook supersedes anything they might be told by a supervisor or other employee. Just because one person is able to ""get away with"" something doesn't mean the behavior is appropriate or condoned by the company.
If you're a manager or a supervisor, make sure you understand the handbook and discrimination policies, and are able to answer questions from employees. Ask questions if there's something you don't understand.

, Continuing education and training keeps the issue in the forefront of employees' minds and demonstrates your commitment to anti-discrimination.


The EEOC has representatives you can schedule to visit your workplace and have a talk on federal anti-discrimination law and workplace discrimination.Quizzes and hands-on activities not only give you confidence that your employees understand your policy, but provide evidence that workplace discrimination is something taken seriously by your company.
Managers and supervisors in particular should know not only how to identify discrimination but also how to handle incidences of discrimination they observe in the workplace, regardless of whether an employee complains.Part of avoiding workplace discrimination lawsuits is being proactive about situations that could potentially be offensive or discriminatory. If you are a manager or supervisor, part of your job is to deal with these situations before they escalate into problems.

, Federal law requires you to make reasonable accommodations for employees' needs related to protected traits or characteristics.For example, if you have an employee who cannot stand for more than 30 minutes at a time, and she is working at a cash register where employees regularly stand for their entire shifts, you must make a stool available for her when she is working so she can sit.Accommodations aren't just related to physical disabilities. For example, if you have a female employee whose religion requires her to wear a head covering, she generally must be allowed to wear that at work regardless of your dress code.If you are a manager or supervisor and an employee asks for an accommodation, you should do what you can to provide it as soon as possible. Avoid questioning the employee's need or making any derogatory remarks â if you dispute that the employee actually needs that accommodation, bring it up with your boss.

, The EEOC has posters and brochures that you can place in employee break rooms and other areas.


These materials typically are available at no cost, and many have been translated into languages other than English. The EEOC makes them available for free download at http://www1.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/index.cfm, or you can order posters and other materials at http://www1.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/order.cfm.
Having your complaint procedure and information about workplace discrimination displayed prominently sends the signal that anti-discrimination is part of doing business, and that their complaints will be handled with professionalism and respect. This can decrease the anxiety some employees may feel about filing a complaint, especially against a supervisor.

, Having more than one person to take reports of discrimination gives employees options if they don't feel comfortable talking to a particular individual.


For example, you may have a female employee who has a sexual discrimination complaint against a male employee, and feels more comfortable talking about it with another female.
The people who handle complaints typically should be supervisors or managers, but you also want to make it clear that employees can go to any supervisor or manager with a complaint and he or she will make sure the situation is thoroughly investigated.
You also may want to have someone outside the company to whom employees can go with complaints, especially if you have a small or family company in which the managerial employees or related or close-knit.
If you are a manager or supervisor and an employee reports an incident of discrimination to you â even if you haven't been designated formally to accept such complaints on behalf of the company â you should handle it professionally. Ask the reporting employee if you can bring someone in to help you if you don't think you're capable of dealing with the situation on your own, or if you lack the specific authority to do anything about it.

, Keeping a written record of everything said related to a discrimination complaint can ensure that stories don't get twisted later.As you're interviewing an employee, take notes on what he or she said. After the interview is over, read your notes back to the employee and get his or her assent that you've recorded the statement correctly.Keep all materials regarding the same complaint in a single file. If there are records of the alleged discrimination, such as emails or job postings, put copies of those in the file as well.Include a log sheet on which each step taken in the investigation is recorded, along with the date and time the step took place., Avoid the urge to write off a discrimination complaint, regardless of how trivial it actually seems.You won't always have to launch a full-blown investigation to get to the bottom of a situation. The allegations may have come about as the result of a simple misunderstanding.However, this doesn't mean you shouldn't take the complaint seriously and work towards a resolution that satisfies everyone involved.
Even if you think the complaint is silly, avoid making the person feel like he or she made a mistake by filing a report, or that you are defending the alleged discriminator. It's important to maintain objectivity. If you feel you cannot do this, perhaps because you are personally close to the alleged discriminator, you might want to bring someone else in to investigate the matter., Make sure employees understand that any information related to a discrimination complaint will not be disclosed or discussed in any other context.


Details about discrimination reports should only be shared with other employees or members of the company on a need-to-know basis, and the identity of employees involved in the incident should be kept private as much as possible.For example, if you allow an employee to switch shifts and have to let human resources know about the change, you don't have to tell staff in human resources that the employee is being transferred because he or she filed a complaint of discrimination.
Keep in mind that employees who are victims of discrimination may feel vulnerable and fear retribution or additional teasing or harassment because they filed a complaint.Protecting those employees means taking steps to ensure discrimination complaints don't become the subject of gossip among employees.

, Employees may not believe that you are taking complaints seriously if you drag your feet in investigating the issue.


Prompt investigation is key if you want to avoid workplace discrimination lawsuits. A complaint provides you with advance notice that there's an issue, and gives you the opportunity to resolve the problem before it escalates any further.The quicker and more efficiently you resolve the complaint, the greater your ability to ease tensions, increase workplace morale, and encourage employees to have confidence in you and your company.If the employee ends up filing a complaint with a state agency or the EEOC, your investigation can provide defenses and decrease your liability., Your anti-discrimination policy will have no value if you allow some employees to slide on violations.


If you bend the rules to favor certain employees, you are treating your employees unfairly. This can open you up to additional liability if a workplace discrimination lawsuit is filed.If you are a supervisor or manager, keep in mind that all employees must be held to the same standard, regardless of their role in the company or your relationship to them.
Even if you have confidence the situation has been resolved, follow up with the employee who filed the complaint after a few weeks have passed. You want to make sure that the conduct fully ceased and that the employee has not experienced any blowback or retribution as a result of the incident."

Keep track of what you read! You can mention authors you admire in your interview to let your prospective employer know that you have prepared.

, Even when you've just entered the job market, it's not too early to specialize. Choose a product you are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about. For example, if your experience is in accounting, it is more practical to apply for a job selling investment plans than it is to apply for a job in pharmaceutical sales.Choose a kind of product that interests you, and research the jobs available in that sector.


Don't be afraid to get very specific. If you are interested in selling cars, focus on used cars, environmentally friendly cars, or luxury vehicles.
Whether you are selling a product or a service, you must know enough about what you are selling that you could explain the benefits in a sentence or two.
Once you have chosen a product, look for resources specific to that field. Subscribe to a magazine for members of the industry, or check out back copies from your local public library.

, Check out the sales courses available at your local community college. Many colleges offer classes in sales and marketing. If you are able to return to school, you could even enroll in a one-year certificate program in sales, or a two-year associates degree.


Sales representatives enter the workforce with a huge range of educational backgrounds. Job candidates with an undergraduate degree in business have an advantage, especially if they have a minor in sales. However, candidates without an undergraduate degree also stand a chance of being hired if they can make a sale.Some fields require certification to enter. Learn the requirements for the job you want to have before you apply for jobs.

, Look up companies in the region where you would like to work in online business directories and telephone books. You will want to give them your resume even if they aren't currently hiring. Positions can open up unexpectedly. If they have your information on hand, they might give you a chance.

, Search online job boards for entry-level positions in your field of choice. Favor positions that offer training, as these companies will help you build your expertise. Remember, not all open positions are advertised. You will want to deliver your resume to companies that don't appear to be hiring, as well as those that do.


Call your local temp agencies and ask about temporary sales positions.Consider starting your sales career in retail. It can sometimes be easier to find entry-level positions in retail than in other fields.Consider being an independent salesperson. Places such as cosmetic companies or travel agencies don't require any previous sales experience, and can help provide you with training and marketing materials.

, When you come across companies you would like to work for, try to find the profiles of their employees. You can search for the company on an online networking website and learn about the job experience and educational background of employees. Determine the amount of sales experience their entry-level employees have. A company that hires sales associates with little to no experience might be open to hiring you.

, Consider your employment history that is not sales related, but that lends to your qualification for the sales jobs you are interested in. For example, if you are applying for a sales position demonstrating power tools in a home improvement store, then it would be worthwhile to highlight your past construction and public speaking experience.


Search your history for hidden sales experience. Have you ever sold your used furniture, or old car? Many jobs include elements of sales, even if they aren't reflected in your title. Highlight this experience on your resume.Make sure your resume looks professional. Look up sample resumes for entry-level sales jobs online.
Get help on your resume. It is easy to miss important details when editing a resume or CV. Check out the schedule of your local library or community center for free resume help. If you know any salespeople, ask them to go over your resume with you.
Customize your resume for each sales job you apply for. For example, if your headline reads, ""Seeking a position in sales,"" then it should be customized in a way that is specific to the job you are pursuing: ""Seeking an entry-level account representative position in the auto parts industry.""

, You will need distinct cover letters for each application. Customize your letter to reflect the qualities the employee is looking for. For example, if the job description specifies a desire for ""honest, organized, and extroverted"" salespeople, then you can use real-life examples, sales-related or not, that exemplify your possession of those qualities.

, You should be able to explain this to prospective employers. Using what you learned about sales, what you know about customers and your reasons for wanting to be a salesperson, formulate a vision of how you would approach a sale. Refer back to the books and articles you have read about sales. Draw up the steps of making a sale as they apply for the position you desire.


An example of a sales philosophy could be ""When I make a sale, I help customers make their own best decisions,"" or ""Let the customer come to you, and be ready to make them glad they did.""

, When you are interviewed, your prospective employer will be looking for the personality traits of a successful salesperson. Salespeople are not required to be outgoing and debonair. Rather, they should be professional, timely, prepared, and resilient.Think of stories that exemplify these qualities. If you have ever applied for a job or other position multiple times, that shows resilience.
Companies are looking for results-oriented salespeople. Think of goals you have achieved, and how you went about achieving them. This will likely come up in your interview., To show that you are invested in getting the job, do more than email the company. Check online to make sure there is no policy against unsolicited visits from job seekers. Dress in professional attire and be friendly and polite to anyone you meet. Ask the person at the front desk where you should drop off your resume, and be sure to get the name of the hiring manager.


Email your resume and cover letter to the hiring manager after you drop them off, to make sure they have your material.
Make a follow up call in a week if you haven't heard from the company.
There are companies that discourage in-person drop offs. Check ahead to ensure there are no explicit warnings against unsolicited visits. You might be turned away. Be very gracious if you are.
If you cannot drop off your resume in person, email it to the hiring manager.

, Read the company's corporate reports, or any mentions in trade magazines. Spend time on their website, and learn specific information you can repeat during the interview. Good salespeople do research to prepare for their sales. Showing up to your interview well-prepared shows that you have the skills necessary to prepare for a sales call., Wear professional attire. If entry-level associates in your field of interest tend to dress more casually, try to dress just a little more conservatively for the interview. Neutral colors, clean and polished dress shoes, and tidy clothing that is neither tight nor loose will serve you well., Treat the interview like the first meeting with a prospective customer: be prepared, polite, and persuasive. Show up on time or a minute early. To show your people skills, make eye contact, and smile. Come prepared with information about the company, and answers for how your presence would fit the company's needs., Even if you have never held a job in sales, you most likely have, at one time or another, convinced or persuaded someone (or a group of people) in your favor. Your story should include an explanation of how you went about ""selling"" your audience on your idea, as well as a description of what the gain was, for both sides.Make it evident that you are an achiever by describing some of your life's biggest achievements, whatever they may be. For example, you may have been the quarterback of your college's football team, served as president of your child's PTA, won first prize in a piano competition or had a short story published in a well-known periodical., If you don't hear from the employer within the time expected, put in a follow-up call. When it comes to procuring a job in sales, persistence pays off.

Set ambitious goals.,
Focus on solutions.,
Accept the limitations of deadlines.,
Look at the big picture.,
Keep your sense of humor.",How to Be Successful in a Stressful Business Environment2," Ambitious goals can still be realistic. The key to keeping goals realistic is to make sure they are clear and that you allow yourself enough time to get them accomplished.Goals need a plan of action in order to be possible. Don't make a goal without also making a plan for accomplishing it.
Use short-term milestones to mark your progress and keep motivation up.

, If youâre always thinking about the problems, you wonât have any time to think about the solutions to those problems. It can be difficult sometimes to come up with the solution to a problem, but once you do, take steps to implement it. This will help you feel that youâre making positive steps forward.If you canât figure out a solution, talk to a coworker whom you trust, or ask your supervisor for guidance.

, Many business environments run on strict deadlines. This can be great for making sure things get done. However, if deadlines are particularly tight, you need to accept that quality may suffer.If quality is of the utmost importance, let your supervisor or the client know that pushing back the deadline would allow for higher quality work. They may be flexible.
If youâre always working toward a deadline, learn how to combat your own tendencies toward procrastination.

, Remember that the job is not your entire life. Neither is your role in the business the thing upon which the entire company rests. Take some time to zoom out and think about the other things in your life that are important. Think about all of the other people who make the business work, even when youâre not there.Think about your family, your friends, and your hobbies. This is likely not the first job youâve ever had, and it may not be the last. Keep things in perspective.
The company was most likely doing fine before you were hired, and it would survive tomorrow without you, too. Itâs good to take your work seriously, but donât let the stakes seem higher than they are.

, This can be tough if your workplace is particularly stressful. However, people who thrive in stressful environments often are able to survive because they are able to see the humor in a situation and not take things too seriously.If you have funny or charming coworkers, let yourself be amused by them. Donât get bogged down with frustration because they seem to be a little less efficient.
Remember that youâre doing your best, and that mistakes can be funny sometimes. Donât beat yourself up over a goofy typo or when you accidentally hit âReply All.â

Clarify your specific duties.,
Organize your work space.,
Prioritize tasks.,
Take breaks.,
Stop multitasking.",How to Be Successful in a Stressful Business Environment3," Often, workplaces become more stressful when boundaries and responsibilities are blurred. If you suspect that some of your stress comes from taking on othersâ responsibilities or not knowing what yours are, get clarification from a supervisor.You can say something like, âIâve been handling all of the outgoing mail. Iâm able to do it, but it takes up a good part of my day. I wanted to make sure that this is in fact my responsibility, just so that Iâm not doing someone elseâs job or using my time poorly.â
If someone else has been taking on your tasks in a way that is frustrating, you can say, âHey, Iâm pretty sure that Iâm managing the Pinky account. Do you know if thatâs changed? If it hasnât, Iâd rather keep working on it by myself, so that I can keep track of any changes. When you take on certain aspects of it, I canât be sure what the last communication with Pinky has been.â
Refer back to the best practices or the employee handbook if you received one when you started.

, Sometimes, you may feel too stressed out or overwhelmed to spend much time organizing your work space. However, organizing your work space can help you improve time management and keep on top of the most important tasks on your to-do list.Clear off your desk. Throw anything irrelevant or unnecessary away, or take it home.
Group similar items, or items related to similar tasks together.
Create a meeting folder that contains things that need discussion.
Keep your space clean and organized by tidying it and clearing piles weekly.

, If you just have one disorganized to-do list, you may not be prioritizing tasks efficiently. Not everything needs to be done on the same timeline. Make sure your to-do list puts things in order of importance, so that you can determine what to focus on first.Remember that there's a difference between ""urgent"" and ""important.""
If something will take a long period of time, or sustained effort, makes sure to schedule it in a way that prevents procrastination.

, When youâre really stressed out, taking breaks might seem like the last thing you should do. You already have too many tasks to cram into your day, so how can you possibly dedicate 15 minutes to doing nothing? While that reasoning might seem to make sense, taking a short break can actually increase your productivity by helping you focus and relax.Many people benefit from a method of working in a very focused way for 45 minutes, followed by a 15 minute break.
Make breaks actual breaks. Donât think or talk about work. Stand up and stretch, go outside, and leave your computer and phone at your desk.

, Multitasking can seem like a great idea in a busy workplace. It helps you get multiple things done at the same time, right? Not exactly. Studies have shown that multitasking is actually not very productive and that humans do best when focusing on one task at a time.If a coworker or supervisor suggests that you should be multitasking, you can say something like, âIâm actually at my most productive when I focus on one thing at a time. The quality of my work is important to me, and if I multitask, I know that the quality of my work slips. However, when I can focus on one thing at a time, I get things done well and on time.

Get enough sleep.,
Simplify your wardrobe.,
Set aside time for emails and calls.,
Take your lunch break and recharge.,
Break your caffeine habit.",How to Be Successful in a Stressful Business Environment4," This may be hard if you have many other obligations, or if you tend to take your work home with you; however, sleep is one of the most important things you can do to ease the burdens of a stressful workplace. Without enough sleep, you wonât have the energy to get everything done at work.Practice good sleep hygiene and make sure your sleeping environment is as conducive to sleep as possible. Make sure itâs dark, quiet, and a reasonable temperature. Turn off the TV, the computer, and your phone to be free from interruptions while you sleep.
If you canât sleep later in the morning, try to go to sleep earlier.

, This may seem silly, but simplifying what you wear can actually take a lot of stress out of your routine. Each morning, you wonât have to agonize over getting dressed and making sure everything matches. Choose clothing pieces that easily go together, and that donât require too much maintenance.Choose subtle, solid colors, as they go well together very easily.
Choose clothes that fit you well and are relatively comfortable. Being stressed out and physically uncomfortable is a terrible combination.
Set out your clothes before you go to bed. This will save you time and stress in the morning.

, Dealing with emails and important phone calls may take up a lot of your day, or only some of it. Either way, itâs important to dedicate a specific time for these communications, rather than trying to squeeze them in throughout the day. For instance, returning phone calls between 11:00 to 11:30 AM and 3:30 to 4:00 PM.Some people prefer to start their day by returning all phone calls and emails immediately. Others set aside time at the end of the day.
Donât attempt to multitask when dealing with communications. The person youâre talking to will likely notice youâre distracted, or your emails may be sloppy.

, Youâre supposed to eat lunch everyday; but if you work in a very stressful environment, you may skip lunch occasionally, or just eat something from the vending machine. But lunch shouldnât just be about cramming food into your mouth. Itâs a time to take a break and breathe each day.No matter how busy and stressed you are, make your lunch break a priority. Take it at the same time each day, and use the entirety of your lunch break to refuel and center yourself for the rest of the day.
If you have lunch with coworkers, make a practice of avoiding shop talk while you eat. Make sure you donât accidentally keep working while youâre supposed to be taking a break.
Schedule short breaks to take a walk. Adding a little exercise to your routine and getting outside of the building if possible can help renew your energy.

, Many people come to rely on coffee, energy drinks, or caffeinated tea to keep them going, caffeine adds to stress. It can elevate your blood pressure and heart rate, increase stress hormone levels and may exacerbate your feelings of stress.In addition, try to reduce or cut out tobacco use. Many people use tobacco to cope with stress, because nicotine causes your brain to release dopamine, which feels good. This is, however, a short-term response, and smoking causes an elevation in blood pressure and heart rate and reduces the oxygen available to your brain, ultimately increasing stress."

Attend a pre-trial hearing.,
Arrive promptly.,

Discuss next steps with your lawyer.",How to Appeal a Denied Workers' Compensation Claim," The letter will have at least 3 pieces of critical information: why you were denied, a description of the appeals process, and deadlines for bringing an appeal. You must identify these pieces of information and underline them.


Workersâ compensation claims are denied for a variety of reason. The most common are: you did not report the injury within the required time, the injury is not severe enough, or the injury was not sustained on the job.Pay particular attention to deadlines. You often will be given only a month to bring the appeal, if not less. If you want to appeal, you should begin immediately.;
, Being denied workers compensation benefits when you are injured is a stressful experience, and bringing an appeal only adds to the stress. The appeals process is complicated, varies by state, and requires that you learn confusing rules of evidence,which could take months. Hiring an experienced workersâ compensation lawyer can streamline the process and bolster your appeal.


Bring a copy of your denial letter as well as all of your medical information to the lawyer, who will need copies of this information for your appeal. And promptly gather any other information your attorney needs. Delays will only delay the appeal process.
Private attorneys will work on a contingency basis. This means they are paid only if they win your case. Generally, the attorney will take around 20% of your benefit amount.The amount is often capped by state law.Under a contingency arrangement, you will still have to pay for costs. Typical costs include filing fees, expert witness fees, and money spent on photocopying and mailing. Try to get an estimate of these costs.

, This goes by various names, depending on the state. In Michigan, it is called an âApplication for Hearing.âIn Arizona, you must file a âHearing Request form.âYour denial letter should tell you where to locate this form.


Federal workers are not covered by their stateâs workersâ compensation systems. Instead, they are covered by the Federal Employeesâ Compensation Act which has its own methods of processing and deciding workersâ compensation claims. Federal workers may appeal in three ways: by requesting a hearing, by appealing to the Appeals Board, or by applying for reconsideration.
Each federal appeal requires different things from the employee. In a hearing, you simply request that the hearing representative review the claim. He may agree to give you benefits or confirm the initial decision. When appealing to the Employeeâs Compensation Appeals Board, you may not provide new evidence; rather, the Appeals Board makes a determination based on the claimâs record. With a Request of Reconsideration, you and your attorney submit either new evidence or new legal arguments., You should always send by certified mail.In this way you will have a receipt for your records.

, Your employer will respond to your appeal and explain why your claim should be denied.


Your employerâs answer provides a sneak peek as to what he will argue on appeal.

, You may be required to undergo an independent medical examination (IME). Your employer or its insurance carrier may request it. The purpose is for an independent physician to identify the cause of the injury as well as the extent of the disability.In some states, the workersâ compensation claims board can request an IME. If you have an attorney, then the IME is scheduled per agreement between the insurance company and your attorney.Though you and your lawyer can object to the IME, an objection will often be interpreted as a concession that the injury isn't as severe as you are claiming.
You should prepare by bringing all requested medical reports and information. Answer all questions fully and truthfully.

, Some states publish written appellate decisions. Kansas, for example, has a database.You should look to see if your state has a database of decisions.


Read up on other cases similar to yours. For example, if you were denied workersâ compensation benefits because your condition was âpre-existing,â then you could research any prior appellate decisions that discussed preexisting conditions.
A case where an appeal was granted in a factually-similar case is strong evidence in your favor that your claim is valid.
Your attorney will be skilled in researching prior decisions. Ask her for copies of any decisions so you can read them.

, At the trial, you will need to present evidence that supports your claim to have been injured on the job.Typically, the most effective witnesses will be medical professionals who can testify to your injuries and co-workers who may have seen the injury occur.


Your state law may or may not provide for subpoena power. If it does, then you can get a blank subpoena form from your workersâ compensation board. Serving a subpoena is a way to assure a witnessâs attendance.
Fill in the form with the witnessâs name and address. Then fill in where the witness is commanded to appear (i.e., where the hearing will be held) as well as the date and time of the hearing.Mail the subpoena using certified mail. Give the witness plenty of time (at least several weeks) to rearrange her schedule in order to attend.

, You will be called to testify about the injury: how it happened and the extent of your disability. To make sure you are an effective witness, you should:


Ask your attorney to do a practice run. Have your attorney pepper you with hard questions to familiarize you with the process.
Review your summary of the event. Shortly after being injured, you should have jotted down what happened and how. Review this information to refresh your memory.
Stay cool on the stand. An attorney may try to rattle you. Answer truthfullyâyou have nothing to hide.

, Generally, the first appeal is held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) or a state appeals board.Before the trial, the ALJ may call you in for a pre-trial hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to make sure the parties are prepared for trial.


If you have any questions, you should ask them at that time. For example, you should ask if the other side has turned over copies of their witness list or the medical reports they intend to use.

, You do not want to be late. If you are unfamiliar with where the trial is being held, then give yourself an extra hour to find parking and go through any security.


Trials are rarely held at court houses. Rather, they are usually held at the offices of the workersâ compensation board.
Dress neatly. Look professional but comfortable. You do not have to wear a suit if it makes you feel awkward., The opening statement will be less formal than in a trial before a jury. Here, the attorneys will state to the judge what issues the parties have agreed on (such as your date of employment) and what issues are in dispute (such as whether you were injured on the job)., You undoubtedly will be called to testify by your attorney. After you swear an oath, your lawyer will ask you questions about how the injury happened. Speak loudly and toward the judge.You should have practiced with your attorney. She cannot ask you leading questions (i.e., questions that contain the answer).But she can ask more general questions: âWhere were you on the morning ofâ¦?â âDid you hurt yourself?â
You will also be cross-examined. If you read your employerâs answer, then you should have a good idea of what questions the other side will ask. For example, if your employer claims you were injured while on vacation, you should anticipate detailed questions about where you went and what you did.

, Your lawyer should briefly explain how the evidence presented supports your legal right to workersâ compensation benefits. He will also rebut your employerâs arguments.

, The ALJ or appeals board will typically draft a written decision. You will receive it by mail.


Sometimes an appeals board will review the ALJâs written order and either adopt its finding or send it back for reconsideration.

, If your claim is denied at the hearing, then an appeal of the denial is possible. Discuss whether or not another appeal is worthwhile and whether your attorney will handle it.


Appeals can also handled on contingency. However, you may have to sign a new client agreement, which redefines the scope of the representation.

Decide what service you want to provide on a freelance basis.,
Ensure you have the equipment necessary to do the job before accepting any new assignments.,
Advertise your services.,
Do not take on more work than you can handle.,
When agreeing to do any type of work that you intend to be paid for, be prepared to issue an invoice, work order, or contract that you and your customer can sign.,
Designate a time and place to do the work that is free from distractions.,
Keep a log of the hours spent working on freelance assignments.,
Expect to make mistakes.",How to Tackle Freelance Time Wasters," The more specific, the better. One possible time wasting element of trying to be too broad in your freelance skills is that you'll try to be a jack of all trades and a master of none, never quite producing high quality work in anything because you're dabbling across everything in your field. Resist this temptation and hone down the freelancing to what you're absolutely best at. You can always sub-contract for areas in which you have weaknesses rather than slowing down your response time and not giving the best service.


Go through your skills list. Ascertain from the start where your strengths and weaknesses are and map out how to deal with weaknesses, such as getting help, not accepting assignments based on your weaknesses, or working with someone else who has strengths where you don't, on a permanent or semi-permanent basis.;
, Lacking the right equipment can slow you down considerably because you'll be attempting to make-do or having to chase across town to find the one place that can do the service for you. Although the initial outlay on equipment might be pricey, in the long run you will save money because everything you need to produce professional outcomes will be at your fingertips and under your own control.


Don't be afraid to call in mobile technical assistance when equipment breaks down on you. The cost of doing this will be far outweighed by having equipment in good working order, fast.
Buy quality equipment at the outset so that it doesn't break down and let you down. If the costs are prohibitive, see if it's possible to make a highly accessible arrangement to share equipment with others in your freelance field who are close by. Make sure that these arrangements are with reliable people who will be happy to see you at 3am in the morning to use the equipment on the odd occasion.

, Be very specific about what service you are actually offering to your potential clients. This will cut down on time spent answering calls and emails from people who need something you can not, or will not do. Use a website to add more details that cannot be included in the advertisements, making it clear in the ad that more information is available there.


If you use an outsourced call center to handle calls about your freelancing, make sure that they have all the necessary facts before them. You don't want to put off customers by having someone else's lack of knowledge undermine your business.

, Too much work will cause you to feel overwhelmed and you'll soon fall behind. Making excuses to clients about things over which you have total control never looks good. Start out slowly until you learn how much work you can realistically complete on your own, taking into consideration the size of your budget, and your team. It is better to make little at first than to get a reputation for being unable to meet what you've promised to do.

, This document should clearly describe exactly the work that you promise to do, and whatever terms for compensation you agree to. This can save an enormous amount of time in the event a disagreement arises regarding the work that should be performed, or the amount of money to be paid by your customer. A binding written agreement can save extensive time and costs in court should a legal dispute arise. This document can be as simple or as complex as your particular discipline requires.

, Although freelancing may offer more freedom than traditional full time employment, it is incredibly important to practice self discipline. If you have constant distractions, you'll be interrupted and lose your flow of thought and action. If you have a noisy workspace treated as a thoroughfare by everyone else, it becomes hard to take your freelancing seriously. Your workspace should be free of excessive noise, unnecessary electronic devices, children that require your care while you are working, etc.


Freelancers working from home often feel guilty about housework and meals. It is important to clarify with all other household members that your work day is as real as anybody else's and that you're not available to do chores and meals on demand. Don't feel guilty if you need to hire a cleaner even though you're constantly at home; having it done is far better than having it weigh heavily on your mind and it frees you up to get more freelancing done.

, Note which tasks are taking more time than others. Look for ways to streamline your work flow. Research tools and techniques that may speed your progress.


If you find some things are taking a lot more time than you originally envisaged, consider whether a change in approach will be adequate or whether it is something you are always going to find a bit of a battle. Administrative tasks can easily become time-wasters that could be better done by someone else, such as students after school, online call centers, or a bored homebody looking for a few hours work a week.
If you feel that your client is demanding too much in the way of additional workloads, be honest about what is and is not possible in your current schedule. By saying yes to everything even though you're swamped, you set unreasonable expectations that you're able to cope.

, Do not let these mistakes discourage you, or cause you to quit. Be determined not to repeat the mistakes that prove costly and time consuming. In time you will increase your speed and effectiveness as a freelancer. And eventually, you will be in a great position to pass on this knowledge to others working freelance.

Ask for leave when you need it.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise.,
Meditate.",How to Be Successful in a Stressful Business Environment5," This will not always work, but itâs worth trying. If you need to take time off because of family obligations, or simply because youâre getting burnt out, talk to your supervisor and see if it might be possible to take some time off.Itâs unlikely that most places will offer you paid time off, but you may be able to take time off if you can manage without a paycheck during that time.
You can ask for a chunk of time off, such as a week or two, or you can ask for a shorter work day or week.
Let your supervisor know that youâre requesting leave so that you can continue to be a productive employee. Say something like, âI know it would mean taking some time away from the office, but it would guarantee that I was able to fully commit once I came back, and that Iâd have the energy to contribute 100% while Iâm here.â

, When you're stressed out, it might be tempting to reach for comfort foods; however, these are often full of sugar, fat, and empty calories that can leave you feeling lethargic and out of control. Aim for high fiber foods and healthy carbohydrates to keep you going.Carbohydrates help the brain to produce serotonin, which can help you feel relaxed when you're stressed. Reach for healthy carbs like brown rice or sweet potatoes, rather than white flour.
Fruits and vegetables contain lots of fiber and make great snacks when you're on the go.

, Exercise is a great way to manage stress. It releases endorphins, which are hormones that make you feel good physically and emotionally. Aim for regular exercise that gets your heartrate up but doesn't leave you feeling fatigued or depleted.Choose an exercise method that you enjoy. If you find it unpleasant, it will just be another stressor in your life. Choose a sport or class that you find fun and interesting.
Consult with a doctor before taking up any kind of exercise program.
Ease into exercise slowly. Don't overdo it or go to extremes right away.

, Meditation is a great tool for reducing stress. You might not think you have time for it, but some techniques can take as little as a few minutes per day. Devotees of meditation often feel that the time they invest in meditation comes back to them many-fold in the energy it gives them to face the rest of their day.There are many different types of meditation. Find one that seems like a good fit for you.
You can fin guided meditations online. Your town may also have a meditation center or group where you can connect with other people interested in meditating.
If you practice a religion, there may be meditations based in that tradition that would feel good to you.

Do some planning.,
Collect sufficient data.,
Consider retaining a professional telemarketing firm in the short-mid term to quickly establish your presence in the marketplace.",How to Establish a New Sales Territory," First and foremost is the geography itself: looking at the physical size of both the territory and the cities and towns that make up that territory will have a significant impact on the market potential. Whether you sell to businesses or individuals, you must look at demographics. Poorly aligned territories can cause lost clients, low morale and squandered resources. The following is a list of suggested steps to consider and questions to ask yourself:


Study the competition
Procure a database of companies that fit your âidealâ customer profile

Prequalify the list to identify companies that have a need for your product / service to evaluate the market potential

Read the article Build a Highly Targeted Prospect List to learn more about prospect prequalification


Be strategic in meeting revenue goals in defined target areaâs first (larger cities for example) then gradually expanding out across the new territory


Develop realistic financial projections relating to start up and carrying costs

Under ideal circumstances, how long would you anticipate having to finance an expansion before you see a modest return on investment
Do you need to invest in a satellite office with staff or, can you have existing sales people travel in the mid-short term until a small customer base is established? Alternatively (and depending upon the type of business you plan to expand), can you hire a rep in the new territory who can initially work from home?

;
, You may want to consider investing in a sales territory alignment and optimization software solution. At one time, only large nationals and multinationals had access to this level of information however, there are many very reasonable priced versions available in the market today. They can help you very quickly and efficiently determine how and where your sales staff should be deployed to maximize territory coverage.

Encourage happy clients to provide recommendations.,
Let friends, colleagues, and family members know you are actively seeking new clients.,
Go to trade shows, conferences, and live events to meet in person.,
Cultivate contacts over time to turn them into sales leads.,
Build a relationship with any potential sales leads or contacts, even if they do not immediately turn into sales.",How to Find Sales Leads1," An advocate who doesn't even work for your company is the best salesperson you could ask for. First and foremost, treat all existing customers with respect, kindness, and generosity. People trust their friends, so creating happy customers is a key way to grow your business and gain leads. This doesn't have to be subtle either -- there are a variety of ways to promote client recommendations:


Provide ""referral discounts."" If a customer gets another person to sign up, buy, or contract your services, give them a 5% rebate or a small gift.
Hand out extra business cards, magnets, etc. and ask your customer to pass on the information to anyone else in need.
Keep customers engaged. 1-2 weeks after service or shipping, contact them again and ask them if they're satisfied with your company. Provide links or ways to share your information.
Just ask -- tell your customers you're a new company looking to expand, and to please recommend you to any friends if they liked your work. People love to feel needed and helpful.;
, You can also offer them incentives to them for recommending you as a way to create a small, impromptu ""sales force."" Note, however, that you don't want to just unleash your friends on the world. You should:


Provide them small packets or brochures with business information, pricing, and a basic FAQ to give to potential customers. There is a reason that Chinese food always comes with new sets of menus!
Fill them in on your company's basic policies, products, and business philosophy. Developing customer relationships early on will pay dividends later.
Brainstorm good leads with customers. Don't just send them out expecting them to find great clients. Let them know the kinds of people you normally help, or who might love your product, and brainstorm a list of people they might be able to talk to.

, Bring a big stack of business cards and, if appropriate, some models of your product or testimonials of service. Mostly, be ready to be your company's number one advocate. Hand out and accept contact information, and have your facts and pitch well-practiced ahead of time


Giving talks, speeches, or panel discussions is a great way to get in front of the crowd and create instant buzz about your product.
After the event, follow up with any promising contacts. Thank them for their time and let them know you're there to answer any questions., The biggest thing here is not to rush. You want to develop a human relationship, one that lets them know they can trust you as more than just a salesperson. It may feel like an eternity until it pays off, but cultivating high-value contacts in your industry poises you to swoop up that big contract when it finally comes through.


Many businesses cannot change clients or vendors on a dime, they have contracts to uphold. Your goal is to be there with an attractive offer when that contract ends.

, The way to do this is to let them educate themselves. This B2B (business to business) marketing process, called lead nurturing, consists of making informative white papers, seminars, case studies, videos, posts and demos available to the leads. The goal is to earn the permission to stay in touch and progressively deepen the relationship so that when the leads do become ""sales ready"", they will want to engage with your firm."

Find out what the businessâ specific needs are and how they relate to your product or service. What will they gain by working with you?;
, The person who can decide about using your product or service is the person who should hear your pitch. Find out who makes decisions about buying inventory or using services in the company.

, Once youâve identified the most appropriate person to listen to your pitch, schedule an appointment with them. Find out when it is most convenient for them.


Be sure to consider the amount of lead time they might need in order to stock your product, or when they will most need your services. For example, if you are selling a holiday-related item, you shouldnât wait until the beginning of December to deliver your sales pitch.

, Once youâve gotten your appointment with the customer, confirm how much time is scheduled with them. Suggest at least 30 minutes for the appointment. Your pitch wonât last the full time; you need to leave time for discussion afterward.

, Before you even start crafting your pitch, make sure you know all the facets of your product or service and how it can be useful to a range of customers. What are the common problems that your product encounters, and how do you resolve these problems?

, A canned pitch is one that is generic and does not take into account the customer.Instead, make your presentation unique and tailored to your audience.

, Tell an anecdote or personal story about your product or service. Use this as a hook to appeal to your customerâs emotion., Strive to be clear and easy to understand. Take out jargon from your presentation, unless itâs standard in your industry to use certain terminology. Donât assume that your buyer will automatically know what youâre talking about, so using simple language is best.

, Be able to get the most important points across in the first minute. After this point, buyers might start to lose interest if they have already decided against your product. Your pitch will likely last much longer than 60 seconds. Hopefully you have at least 15-30 minutes, depending on the type of product or service; spend much of your time building a conversation. But make sure you build in the most important points immediately.These include:


The name of your company (or your name if you are working as an individual)
The products or services you provide
The âWhatâs In It For Meâ aspect: tell your buyer what they will gain by buying your product.

, This is one of the key factors in a good sales pitch. Your customer isnât always interested in how many awards your product has won, or how many stores you have merchandise at. They want to know how your product or service will improve their business and make their life easier.

, Describe how your product or service is different from others who offer similar products. Focus on how your product is unique or how you give personalized service.

, An important feature of the pitch is to have two-way communication with your audience. You might already know their needs, since youâve done your research. But you should give them an opportunity to tell their story and to describe what makes their situation unique.If you donât feel comfortable yet trying to involve your audience throughout your pitch, plan for a question-and-answer session after your pitch. This will give them a chance to ask questions and get more information., Your customer may find reasons to decline your sales pitch. Be prepared with answers to these objections. Make a list of the top 10 reasons why someone might say they donât need or want your product. Craft responses to each of these., Some people find visual aids, such as PowerPoint slides, useful in staying on track with a presentation and demonstrating or visualizing certain aspects of a productâs benefits or features. Visual aids can be distracting, however, especially to you. You might start to turn your focus to just reading through the slides instead of conversing with your audience., If you have a product that can be demonstrated, such as how sharp knives can cut through rope or stain remover can eliminate ink stains, incorporate this demonstration into your pitch.

, Once youâve written down your pitch, find ways to cut down words, clarify meanings, and make your wording more dynamic. Eliminate parts that donât apply to the particular customer youâre going after.

, Practice delivering your pitch to a colleague or friend. Ask them what makes sense and what doesnât make sense. Run through a revised version of your pitch with them to see how it has been improved.

, One or two days before your pitch, email or call your customer to confirm your appointment. Make sure they still have the time to devote to hearing the pitch.


Also confirm who will be attending the pitch. Will the companyâs CEO be there? Will someone from another division of the company be attending?

, You might be nervous going into your meeting, but getting a good nightâs sleep will ensure that you are operating with maximum energy and focus.

, Present a professional image to your customer. Your physical appearance will assure them that you are responsible and will deliver a product or service on time. A business suit is most appropriate.


Consider the norms of the industry that youâre presenting to, not your own. If you normally work outside and get dirty, but you are presenting to someone who works in an office, dress as you would for the office environment.

, Leave early and give yourself plenty of time to get to the location where you will deliver your sales pitch. This will give you a chance to check your appearance, get a drink of water, and calm your nerves before going into a meeting.

, Introduce yourself and give everyone in the room a chance to do so, too.

, Delivering a pitch can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially if itâs the first time youâre doing it, or itâs a really important contract. But you want to project confidence, so make sure to breathe deeply and take your time.

, Have good posture and try to minimize any nervous fidgeting. Stay as relaxed as possible. Speak with enthusiasm and authority, but with a friendly manner., You can keep someoneâs attention better if you maintain eye contact with them. This will also make them feel like you are really focusing on them and their reaction to what youâre saying. Keep friendly eye contact throughout your conversation with your customer.

, Check in with your customer during the presentation. Donât just deliver your pitch and pack up. Be ready to listen to your customer as you proceed, stopping to answer questions., As you deliver your sales pitch, it may become clearer to your customer that your product or service can help them. Ask questions during the pitch so that you can understand their needs better., Be ready to give them good answers to their questions that keep pushing them towards your product or service.


Consult with the customer and asking questions about their interests and their past experience with similar products.

, You have delivered your pitch and answered questions that your customer has. Now you need to give them some direction on the next steps to take.You may choose to schedule a follow-up meeting once theyâve had some time to think things over. You might give them a trial period to use your product. Above all, keep working at this relationship and donât disappear from view.


For example, if you are selling advertisement, you could end your pitch like this: âAs you said, Mr. X, your company is looking for more brand awareness and new clients. Our marketing solutions will provide you with the brand awareness you are looking for. If you could allow me, I can run you through the procedure of advertising through us...â This is a simple, indirect way of asking, âAre you interested?â

, You may need to negotiate with your customer. If they have initially declined your product or service, you can help them get to a âyesâ or even a âmaybeâ through negotiation. Think about giving them a sample or a trial period to use your product. Alternately, if you are selling them a service, offer a free or reduced cost for a trial period., If the customer declines your product or service, and they do not change their mind even after you negotiate with them, then respect their decision. Accept the rejection gracefully and thank them for their time.

, This customer, if youâve chosen a good representative from the industry, will likely have good contacts that will be worth exploring as other potential customers. This will build your network of contacts and get your name out there., Thank them for the meeting, regardless of its outcome. If you made plans for next steps, such as signing an NDA, getting a referral, or scheduling another meeting, include that in your email. If you offered to send them more information, make sure that you include it.

, Think about what worked and what didn't, and make tweaks to your presentation or style accordingly.

Do weigh up whether you want to leave or resign.,
Do go to your superiors and expose the bullies.,
When asking for a raise or promotion, do approach the subject from the angle of your worth to the business.,
If you are pregnant, do tell your boss as soon as possible.,
Do choose your battles wisely when dealing with workplace conflict.,
Don't ask for an increase when the company is struggling, no matter how much you feel you deserve one.,
Do focus on what you can contribute to the company by taking on an extra project or doing your part in saving costs.",How to Avoid Office Pitfalls," Resigning is an important decision. It will affect your career, your resume and your financial stability. If you want to leave because you feel unappreciated or the office politics is too much to deal with, speak to a senior person allowing them the opportunity to deal with the issue before you actually resign. Management needs to be made aware of how your morale is being affected before they lose you.When you've made your decision to resign choose the right time to tell your employer. Avoid deadline periods or extremely busy hours. Your intention to leave should take the form of a formal resignation letter. "" not a casual by the way comment made over the watercooler or in front of clients"". Don't hand in your resignation without giving the business an opportunity to make it right. Avoid empty threats, if you say you are resigning, follow through. Please do not see this as an opportunity to criticize your boss or the company as you may need a reference from your boss for future jobs and positions.;
, Bullying is a silent epidemic that can cause a host of health related complications, heart problems, anxiety, depression and even post traumatic stress disorder. Take time to build your case against bullies by keeping track of specific incidents and cases. Bullying can be very subtle, for example a manager or colleague overloading you with tasks and that are not a part of your job description. Don't expect a polite request to stop bullies in their tracks. Unfortunately bullies rarely change of their own accord, so the options usually simmer down to fight or flight.

, If you are asking for a raise you should be able to justify why you deserve it. Point out how you are currently working beyond what is expected of you and how your promotion will be in your companies best interest. Don't expect a raise or promotion on the basis of how long you've worked for the company. A sense of entitlement and arrogance will work against you.

, First consider your finances, your legal rights and the kind of maternity leave you want to take. Take the time to work through the practicalities and be ready to suggest solutions or a framework that will suit both you and your boss. Some solutions could include looking for a temp to fill your position while you are away or by redistributing work to your colleagues. Don't leave it till the last minute. This will just put you, your boss and your colleagues under unnecessary stress and makes you seem flighty and unreliable.

, Decide how important the issue is to you and whether is is worth tackling. If it is, approach the situation calmly, using neutral language to discuss what it is that's bothering you. Don't make judgments and generalizations. Focus on the problem and not the person. Bringing up personality traits you don't like about them is not constructive. Tackle the issue at hand.

, This is definitely not the time to ask for a bonus, as you may put your head on the chopping block, if the company is seriously considering retrenching staff.

, Management will see your effort and who knows, they may offer you a bonus in appreciation of your added contribution.

Set up a regular, solid social media account, but don't rely on it for leads.,
Maximize your webpage's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the most effective burst of sales leads.,
Produce informative, knowledgeable content about your product or industry.,
Use your website to track your visitors, figuring out your marketing strengths and weaknesses.,
Be readily available online, with contact info on every page at least.",How to Find Sales Leads2," Social media is crucial for outreach, exposing your brand to new people, and getting real-time feedback from customers. But research shows that Facebook, Twitter, and the like aren't very good at giving you effective sales leads. That does not mean you shouldn't be active on social media -- as this will help you prove your company is active and trustworthy online. It just means you shouldn't try to snag customers completely through hashtags and likes. Social media will help, however, when:You have a sale.
You want to create awareness of a new product or service.
Building name recognition, which helps eventually turn contacts into sales.

If you do use social media, LinkedIn is proven to have the highest lead conversion rate., SEO is considered the cheapest but best way to increase sales. Why? Because 90% of consumers report that their first move when buying services or goods online is to Google the industry.If your drumstick manufacturing business doesn't show up on the first page, up high, then very few drummers will be ordering your product.


SEO is about finding your search terms and making it so that you are the most reliable site for Google to point to. For example, you might try to show up top for ""buy new drumsticks.""
Younger companies have the most success with specific SEO. You might not win the Google race for ""new drumsticks"" against big corporations like Vic Firth, but you might win ""new hand-crafted drumsticks,"" ""new birch-wood drumsticks,"" or ""new heavy-metal drumsticks.""Create content around your tags every day to quickly shoot up the Google rankings. Tag every post, picture, meta-data, and text with your search terms to move even faster.

, This is especially crucial for tech companies or manufacturers. If you're the online leader in information about a product then you are also the go-to source for the industry at large. And when your judgment and insight is trusted, your product is trusted as well. While writing blog posts that don't ask for money or sales may seem counter-productive, avoid sounding like a salesperson at all costs. The goal is to be the most knowledgeable, impartial-seeming company out there. The sales leads will follow.


Offer free content to entice new clients in. Podcasts, blogs, how-tos, videos, and pictures will all increase SEO, attract readers, and bolster your brand., If your customer base is mainly the industry and businesses, you can track your website visitors with the help of Meet Leads or Google Analytics, free cloud-based services that tell you where your traffic comes from, the pages it looks at, and when they leave for another website. This information is invaluable when turning page views into sales leads.


Do viewers make it to your online store, or do most leave before getting there? Try to make this one of the most visible, and popular, pages on your site.
What kind of links, content, and pages bring people in the most? How can you replicate this success on more pages?What pages drive people away? These are often called ""bounce"" pages or ""exit pages.""

, People can't buy or order your services if they can't figure out how to get in touch with you. Don't assume they can see the ""contact us"" button at the top of the page. If your website sells something, put contact information or links on every single page to drive up sales.


An online chat feature, or direct email service with prompt responses, can quickly turn a ""maybe"" into a sale.Simple is better. Your page should be easy to navigate, not confusing or overly-ornate.

Know, research, and pinpoint your market -- the types of people most likely to do business with you.,
Consider markets and companies you can cross-promote or co-market with.,
Craft a diverse set of sources for leads, keeping track of each's effectiveness.,
Determine which marketing tactics are effective by tracking their results.,
Create and collect lists of emails, contacts, followers and phone numbers for later sales pushes.,
Once you have determined sales leads, stay in touch to move the leads from 'sales lead' to 'sales prospect'.",How to Find Sales Leads3," Not everyone is likely to buy every product or service. In a world with limited resources, you need to prioritize where you market and search for leads. Of course, each business has different markets, but there are helpful questions you can use to find yours, as well as how to use the information:


What age of the person is likely to buy my product/service? (Younger people use more online, older more print and TV.)
Is my product gender specific? (Are there blogs, reviewers, and sites that might want to test a product for their viewers?)
What other products would someone who likes my product buy? (Can you market your product in similar places and ways as these other similar products?)
What interests to people who like my product share? (Where do your potential leads like to hang out, what do they research, what sites do they read, etc?)
What problem does my product/service solve? (Find and illustrate the success of your product towards people who are struggling.)

, This one takes some work, as you'll need to find a company that wants to work with you. But the benefits can be astounding. For a simple example, think of a homemade baker with a killer chocolate chip cookie. Selling to other people is working on its own, but it would be much easier to move a product if you teamed up with a dairy farmer, for example. Since the milk & cookie markets overlap but don't compete, you can each share sales lead information. You're not going to run each other out of business (different products,) but you might just double your sales.This is obviously a silly example, but real-world co-marketers like this are everywhere. Think of a lawn-maintenance service that teams up with landscapers, or a tutoring company that helps watch kids at an after-school program or daycare.

, Leads can be generated by many different marketing campaigns or can have many different sources. Leads can be generated through mailings (fax, paper, and email), fairs, trade markets, phone (call centers), database marketing, and the websites. Leads from websites are often called web leads. A new lead source is called a live transfer lead. These leads are generated by a dialer that dials a set of phone numbers, plays a message to the individuals, and then those individuals have the opportunity to press 1 to be connected to a live agent. Sometimes live lead transfers are sent to a call center agent who then qualifies the individual before sending to the sales agent.


You can often buy phone numbers for telemarketing, finding databases online.
Direct mailing, especially to contacts you already know or might be interested, is a great way to get your first few leads.
Don't put all of your eggs in one basket at first -- try several methods of getting leads.

, Track exactly how many clients come in from each marketing tactic, and use only the ways that are most efficient. Each industry is different, so these strategies need to be tinkered with and balanced to find success in your business. When keeping track, you should note:


Money and time spent on marketing ploy.
Number of clients acquired
Quality of clients (big spenders, small sales, willingness to recommend others, etc.)

, Whenever possible, collect the information from potential sales people, holding onto it to help develop leads down the line. Sometimes this is easy -- simply require an email address to place an order or ask a question, and keep track of all the emails. Sometimes this requires harder work, like weekly email bulletins (which people can sign up for on your website).


Getting people to ""sign up,"" offering free packets or information for subscribers, and offering daily content for followers will build up a big database of potential customers.
Do not mix sales and customer collection -- people are much less likely to sign up if you're trying to overtly sell them something off the bat.
Do not ""over ask"" your lists for things. Work on building a big, rich contact list, then ask all of them at once for support or business down the line., Typically, this involves identifying the lead's product applicability, availability of funding, and time frame for purchase. Additional operations may also be performed such as background research on the lead's employer, general market of the lead, contact information beyond that provided initially, or other information useful for contacting and evaluating a lead for elevation to prospect.


Try and get in touch with someone authorized to make a sale as soon as possible.
Work quickly, and make yourself available to answer any questions or issues."
"
Understand the 1% rule.,
Define the profile of your ideal prospect.,
Start the process.,
Improving the overall quality and accuracy of your lead base:


The first step in converting a higher percentage of leads into sales starts with improving the overall quality and accuracy of your existing data base.,
Do stage two of pre-qualification.,
Develop your script.,
Do the follow-ups.,
Develop a sales pipeline that generates significantly more revenue.,
Refer to the example of a lead funnel and sales pipeline.",How to Convert a Higher Percentage of Leads into Closed Sales,"


Whether you obtain sales leads through trade shows, incoming inquiries or an existing database, identifying which prospects offer the greatest sales potential will ultimately ensure a much higher sales conversion.
Depending on the quality of your leads base and the product or service you offer, studies suggest that as little as 1% of leads may qualify as ideal prospects (i.e., they have a need for your product or service and have a budget allocation or timeline requirement). Moreover, of those that qualify, you may only see a 1% conversion to sales.
So how do you effectively increase the odds?;
, Begin by looking back at the sales you closed over the past few years and identify the broad commonalities that existed between each of those companies, for example:




Were they within specific industry sectors?
Was there size a factor (revenue / number of employees / number of locations)?
Did geographical location have an influence?


The next stage is to identify the key criteria that existed within each one of those companies when you first established contact, for example:

Did they currently use a similar product / service?
If so, what type of âsystemâ did they use?
How old was their existing system?
Did they have plans for upgrade or expansion? If so, what was the timeframe?
If they were not using a similar product or service at the time, what determined or, motivated their interest to purchase?


Creating an ideal prospect profile is a fundamental step in understanding your market (in going through the process, you may find that you will need to develop more than one as it relates to different product offerings). Companies that have a well defined understanding of their target market generate a much higher percentage of well-qualified leads, and your sales people will be much more effective at accurately qualifying sales opportunities from much earlier stage in the sales cycle.

,


Solid market intelligence and a well defined, ideal âprospect profileâ are key to weeding out those leads that do not offer any sales potential while at the same time, identify those that have a potential requirement for your product or service offering.

Obviously, if you have incoming inquiries then you are at a distinct advantage as we can assume that someone is calling because they have an interest in your product or service. That said, the following sets of pre-qualification questions (see below) are still a good guideline to follow.
If you are following up on trade show leads, I would suggest following the pre-qualification question protocol (see below) to gain key market intelligence prior to speaking with the individual you or your sales team met with at the trade show. This will provide you with an opportunity to speak with more âinsiderâ intelligence, allowing for a more focused discussion.
For outbound cold calling, the following steps are critical to success.



,
Ongoing prospect list cleansing is a critical component to sales and marketing success and can have an enormous impact on your ability to improve efficiencies and drive down costs by reducing inaccuracies:

The most up to date contact and address information
Accurate telephone numbers and email addresses
Parent company and subsidiary flagging
Information augmentation
Removal of duplicates


Develop a list of 4 to 5 general questions to ensure that a lead fits your key prospect profile (this information can usually be obtained from the receptionist and as a result makes fast work of the first cut), i.e.:

Specific industry sector
Size (revenue / number of employees / number of locations / etc.)
Ensure this is the decision making location
Identify whether or not they would be a good fit for your product or service in very general terms (if for example you sell storage and racking solutions, identify whether or not they have a warehouse or storage facility)
Identify the name of the decision maker (plus title and department) if they fit the above criteria


Generally, this first cut in pre-qualification (if outbound calling) will generate 60 - 100 completed calls per day. Of those, you will be able to weed out those companies that are not a good fit (remembering to update pertinent information in your database).
For those companies that fit your âgeneralâ target criteria, stage two of the pre-qualification can take place.

,


Develop a list of 3 to 5 questions designed to identify specific key criteria as it relates to your product / solution offering. Position these questions at a manager level individual within the target department rather than the key decision maker (Dir / VP / C level). Still using our example of storage and racking systems:

Do they currently use storage / racking systems (If not, do they have plans in the future for a storage facility)?
If so, what type of system do they use?
How old is their existing system?
Do they have plans for upgrade or expansion? If so, what is the timeframe?
What is the approximate square footage of their warehouse / storage facility?


The answers to these questions will help you twofold: One, you will have gathered solid market and lead intelligence and two; you will have identified those prospects that may have a short to mid-term requirement.
For a more detailed explanation of how to pre-qualify leads, please refer to the wikiHow article How to Build a Highly Targeted Prospect List for step-by-step instructions.

,


You know your product or service inside out, so you may be wondering why you need to develop a script. That's because, in the business of cold calling, you have 30 seconds or less to grab someone's attention so your pitch had better be spot on:

Tie in key issues relative to the range of services offered, incorporating strengths, benefits and value proposition
Tailor the approach to accommodate a discussion with the appropriate industry sector and relevant company officers (operations, finance, IT, marketing, etc.)
Anticipate all possible objections and prepare appropriate responses
Structure questions that are designed to draw out information and involve the prospect


For a more detailed explanation of how to develop a script, please refer to the wikiHow article How to cold call effectively for step-by-step instructions (which also covers: getting past the gatekeeper / dealing with objections and closing for an appointment).

,


Follow-ups should be timely and reliable. A CRM solution can be of great benefit in managing this process by ensuring that opportunities do not fall to the wayside.
In addition, you might consider developing an email marketing campaign. Maintaining regular contact with your customers and prospects can be a successful strategy in staying âtop of mindâ. In addition, by keeping them informed about new products and services offerings or relevant industry news, you can gain a significant competitive advantage.

,


Companies with an ill-defined sales pipeline need to refine the parameters of what a genuine, sales ready opportunity actually looks like. There are several key benefits to developing a sales pipeline:

Sales / revenue projection
Easily manage sales activity at key stages in your sales process
Identify area's that require immediate attention

A shortfall of pre-qualified leads
A drop in sales conversions at the proposal stage




Begin by looking at your existing client base to identify the steps you took to prior to closing a deal, for example:


Lead: A lead is company you have not yet contacted. That said it should have a similar profile to your existing client base (industry sector / size / etc.)

Qualified prospect: This is a prospect that fits most if not all of your pre-qualification criteria; they currently use or would benefit from your product or service / they have an ongoing need and or plan to implement or upgrade your specific product or service within the next 1-5 years. Those companies that will likely close in the shorter term should be maneuvered towards being active prospects and the longer-term prospects should be nurtured.

Active prospect: Through discussion, you have identified that a prospect has a need for your service and they in turn have confirmed an interest in your offering. You have confirmed that they have both a budget and timeline requirement. Both you and the prospect have agreed to a next step (be-it a follow up discussion / a demonstration / a quote / etc.). This can be a lengthy and time-consuming process but it is one of the most important periods in the sales process.

Committed prospect: Commitment to move forward may come in the form of verbal commitment however; you may still be in the process of ironing out the details. A transaction may be contingent on certain terms being met, so this is still a critical stage in closing the deal.

Closed: A sale has transpired when a contract is signed by both parties and delivery dates have been confirmed. At this stage, the sales person may move onto the next opportunity and or he/she may be responsible for managing the account.



, For the purposes of this example, this article shows percentages as they relate to each stage in the sales cycle. However, it is recommended that you replace these percentages with actual numbers when developing your own pipeline.


Begin tracking the number of raw leads and each subsequent step in the sales cycle to ascertain the number of leads necessary and the time required to achieve each closed sale. This will help determine not only the volume of leads required to grow your business but also, help you to identify where there are weaknesses in the process which may need addressing.

Develop a script.,
Do some practice calls to people on your list.,
Enter your list into an organizational system.,
Anticipate and respond to objections from this list.,
Call the rest of the people on your list.,
Keep refining and call some more.",How to Cold Call Effectively1," Work though in your mind what you would say to someone when you get them on the phone.


Never begin your conversation with asking, âHow are you?â It comes across as disingenuous, so save your pleasantries for people with whom you have an established relationship.
If you are calling to book an appointment, briefly introduce your company and service, confirm that they are the correct person and ask if it is a good time to talk. If it is, you can now give them the pitch (otherwise ask if there would be a more convenient time to call back and make a note to follow up).
Make sure you include a couple of strong benefit statements as early into the conversation as possible.
Incorporate questions into your pitch. It is important that you involve the prospect in the conversation and questions are a great way to allow for interaction. Using some of the insight gained from your pre-qualification, you can structure questions that can create an opportunity to close. For example; âJohn, I understand that you have an XYZ controls solution in place at the moment, but does your company have a mandate to try to further reduce your utility spend?â Structured this way, you create an opportunity to close for the appointment.
Refer if possible to a project you just completed at another company that profiles similarly to theirs in terms of size or industry sector, for example: ""We just completed a project with Mount Sinai Hospital and through the implementation of our controls solution, we were able to reduce their utility bills by 30%, with a projected ROI of 2.5 years."" Note, though, that you would rather have the prospect be talking/answering questions, than have you talking more about specifics.
The more specific you are, the more compelling your statement will be. You can then ask if he would be interested in achieving learning more, if he says yes, then you have your opening to ask for the appointment.
Finally, read your script aloud. Does it have a natural, conversational flow? Is it too long? Does it allow for interaction? Try practicing it on colleagues to get their feedback.;
, It is normal that you find your pitch isn't quite right, or that your list needs refining. Try it on some live prospects to make sure it works.


Redo your list or your pitch should it be needed. Normally, you don't get it right first time.

, You could use a simple spreadsheet or a CRM system like salesforce.com. Either way, you need to put your logs of calls somewhere so you know when to call prospects back.

, When you did your practice calls, you should have gotten some objections like, ""I don't have any money"" or ""I heard your company is horrible.""


You should practice your responses to objections.
Remember, a prospect that objects is still engaging and talking with you. That is a good thing and gives you an opportunity to engage them in good conversation.
Many sales people hear, ""I don't have a budget to buy this."" The skilled way to handle this depends, but could include seeing if the prospect would be interested if there was a no money down or pay later plan.
Objections allow you to ask questions to help identify if an objection is real or just a smokescreen, as well as how you can provide alternative solutions to address the problem. Write down your list of potential objections along with the responses and keep it next to your script when cold calling.

, Book a lot of sales appointments!


Note when the person you are calling is not there, and call them back the next day.

, Remember that a good script is a work in progress and your first attempt may not get you the results you need. Ask yourself these questions:


In retrospect, were my pre-qualification questions the right ones and or, do I need to add or replace a qualifier?
Were my benefit statements strong enough and early enough in the conversation?
Did I show enough value?
Do I need to rework my responses to objections?
Did I effectively close for an appointment when an opportunity arose?

Follow-up.",How to Close a Sale," Even though you are participating in a business transaction, there's nothing wrong with befriending the person you will be selling to. Making a customer welcome will give them comfort in purchasing what you have to offer to them.



Smile with your eyes. The human subconscious can easily detect a fake smile from a real one.How? Real smiles activate the eyes, whereas fake smiles don't.
Be careful about maintaining too much eye contact. Researchers at Harvard University have found that salespeople who maintain eye gazes actually may discourage would-be buyers.The theory here is that eye-contact signifies dominance â not something that makes you want to buy.;
, Spend as long as necessary qualifying a customer so that you sell them what they need. There's nothing worse than selling a product or service that the customer is later dissatisfied with. The best and most commonly used question in qualifying is, ""What will you be using this for?"" Continue to ask questions to narrow down the search for what the customer really wants. This shows a willingness to learn and a legitimate interest in the needs of the customer.

, It is important to understand how all of the products and services you have to offer work. By understanding this, you'll be able to offer the one that best fits your customer's needs. Be sure to offer as many relevant products or services that you have to enhance customer satisfaction.


Many successful restaurants allow servers to sample each item in the menu â free of charge â in order to develop a feel for what they are selling. That way, they can combine expertise and experience in their sales pitch when a diner asks ""What do you recommend?""
Make it your job to test many, if not all, of the items you are selling. Customers can smell amateurism and disinterest from a mile away. Even if the item(s) you're offering don't come discounted or free of charge, make it part of your job to test them out.

, Buying signals can be both verbal and non-verbal. Questions like, ""How may this benefit me?"" or ""What product most suits my needs?"" are classic examples of verbal buying signals. Non-verbal buying signals (if you are dealing with a customer in person) might include the customer holding or using a product as if they already owned it.

, Once you observe buying signals, stop selling and close the sale. A common mistake that can lose a sale is to continue to sell and offer products/services after the customer has already indicated that they are willing to make the purchase.

, These are two of the most basic closes. You may want to learn toward the indirect close at first. Unless you are pretty sure that the customer is chomping at the bit and is ready to make the deal, the direct close is somewhat discouraged among sales circles.



Direct Close: ""May I write this up for you?"" or ""Should I forward a contract so you can get started?""

Indirect Close: ""How do these terms look to you?"" ""Is this agreeable to you?""

, A lot of sales situations are really emotional decisions in which the buyer has convinced him- or herself they're making a rational decision. (Buying a car, for example.) Still, some sales situations are really all about rational pros and cons. Use the balance sheet close, also known as the Ben Franklin close, to appeal to the rational customer:


In the balance sheet close, the salesperson will make a list of the pros and cons with the customer.The good salesperson will make sure that the pros outnumber and outweigh the cons.

, The puppydog close is often employed by â you guessed it â pet store owners by letting doubtful customers take home a puppy with the option of returning it if the customer is unhappy. The customer takes the puppy home, plays with them, and the sale is effectively cinched, not by the salesperson, but by the puppy.If you're confident that what you're selling has lots of appeal and will be hard to give up once it's been used and enjoyed, this is a great closing technique to use.

, The assumptive close is where the salesperson knowingly assumes that the customer has already agreed to purchase the item and begins to wrap up the sale: ""The sound system is just killer. And I promise you that you'll fall in love with the V8 â she really purrs. Now, did you want it in black or red?"" Notice how the salesperson assumes that the sale is closed; she doesn't give the customer a chance to object.The pitfalls of this approach are pretty obvious; use with caution!

, Emotions are an extremely powerful thing, especially when coupled with money. If you learn to massage the emotions of your potential customers without making them feel manipulated, you're in for a payday:


Try the possibility of loss close: This is where the salesperson tries to close a sale by noting that the product is going to run out or that it won't be available at its rock-bottom price for much longer. This appeals to customer's sense of regret.
Try the cradle to grave close: This close also appeals to a customer's sense of regret. In it, the salesperson rebuts a potential customer's objection that it's too soon to buy by saying that it's never too soon to make a major life purchase.
Try the sales contest close: This is where the salesperson offers a small incentive to the customer, such as a modest rebate, justifying it by mentioning that you stand to gain if you close. ""If I make this sale, my wife and I get to go on a cruise."" This appeals to the customer's sense of guilt; their fate is interlocked in yours.

, The minor close assumes that agreement about a minor issue means agreement about the sale. ""Would you prefer our wireless service with your current package? No? Alright, we'll leave it minus the wireless.""

, Repeating questions like ""Is there anything about the product you're still unsure of?"" or ""Is there any reason you wouldn't want to pull the trigger?"" puts the customer in a situation where they are not given the option to refuse the sale. Continue asking them negative assumption questions until they agree to the sale.

, If you're constantly shuttling back and forth between your manager's office, you begin to sow doubt in the potential customer's mind. Try to stay with your customer as much as possible after you sniff out the initial interest. Use your precious minutes to continue the sales process and convince the customer that their choice is really the one they want to make.

, Upselling is the art of selling the customer additional items or pricier items than what they originally intended. (""Would you like to supersize your order?"") Upselling can work in some cases where the customer doesn't truly know what they want, but too many salespeople use the trick with abandon. There are two very good reasons to mistrust the upsell in most sales situations:


It can make the customer feel bad/unsure about their original purchase. If the customer is unsure about their purchase in the first place, the best the salesperson can do is close the sale as quickly as possibly. Upselling often forces us to question what we wouldn't have otherwise.
It can discourage repeat business. A lot of really great salespeople survive from repeat offend...er, business. If you upsell someone something they really don't want, they won't go to you for business a second or third time.

, Each failed close makes a case for inadequacy and sows doubt, but not for you: You remain confident even in the face of peril. You believe in yourself. Because each time a customer buys something from you, they hope to buy a little bit of your confidence along with the car, the mortgage, the vacuum. Remember that. Plan for a close on each call or customer you take.

, Good follow-up is essential to getting repeat customers. Offer to help the customer with any questions or concerns they have about the product or service you are selling after you've made the sale. Verify that all products were received to their satisfaction and to let you know if they have any questions whatsoever.

Name your website URL something that's easy to remember; it could be your name or something that grabs prospective customers' attention.
Even though Avon is called a ""direct selling"" company, you don't have to go door-to-door to sell it anymore.

Consider everyone you meet a potential customer. This includes people at church, other parents in the PTA, people at work or at your spouse's work, and the people you chat up at the playground.
Avon gives its new representatives the suggestion that they should try to talk to three people about Avon every day.That might seem like a lot, but when you realize that most of those conversations will not result in a sale, it isn't that many after all.

, Avon makes all types of products, from make-up, shampoo, and conditioner, to clothing, shoes, and jewelry. They even make dÃ©cor, gift items, and toys for children.


When you use your own products, you are better equipped to talk up the benefits. Plus, if you receive a compliment on your eye shadow or shoes, you can launch into a pre-planned sales pitch about Avon and the affordable price of the item.

Define Qualifying Prospects.,

Understand your prospect's needs: This is the most important stage in the Sales Process, but also the most overlooked one.,
Meet Your Prospect's Needs.,
Establish your Unique Selling Proposition (USP).,
Always Ask for Action.,
Follow up with your prospect.",How to Complete the Sales Process from Prospecting to Closing Sales," Not everybody is going to buy your product or service. There is bound to be a group of people who are more likely to have a need for your product and will purchase it as compared to the general public. Who are the customers that had already bought your product? Do they share a common traits? or do they fit into a specific demographic profile, such as living in a certain area, their age group or gender? By qualifying your prospects who have a higher probability of doing business with you, you are able to better make use of your time and effort while meeting with them.;
, Building good relationship and trust with your prospects is a very important step in the Sales Process. If you failed to gain your prospect's trust, you will never get him to close the deal no matter how attractive your proposal seems to be. This is because he is likely to suffer a huge loss should anything happen. Trust takes many years to build, but takes a moment to be destroyed. As such, it is advisable to always to be truthful to your clients, and not do anything that might hurt your reputation. As once the trust is broken, you might never be able to re-build it again.

, How many a time had we seen or heard salespersons trying to push a product or service to prospects without first trying to truly understand the actual needs of the prospects. A prospect will not buy a product which he do not need, no matter how cheap the product is.

, After understanding your prospect's need, how is your product or service able to fulfill that need? Paint a picture in your prospect's mind how he is able to enjoy the benefits of your product after he had purchased it. If a client can see how your product is able to solve his problem or meet his needs, it will be easy for him to make the decision to commit to the purchase.

, If you are selling a product and service that are similar to what others are already offering in the market, why must your prospects buy it from you? What makes you different and stand out from the crowd? Unique Selling Proposition (USP) is a marketing strategy that successful campaigns used to differentiate their products and services from their competitors'. By establishing your USP that your competitors are unable to provide, you will be able to gain a group of loyal fans who will come back for your products again and again.

, Most often than not when a prospect is not ready with the purchase, a natural response would be to procrastinate and delay signing on the dotted line. It is advisable for a salesperson in this situation to always ask for action, either to ask for close or for an appointment to the next meet-up. This can help in moving the prospect a step closer to making the final decision.

, Contacts with a prospects should not stop after the deal is closed, and it is advisable for a salesperson to follow-up with the prospect after the close. He can always follow-up with the customer by giving him a call or paying him a visit a few days after the close, to check with him if he is satisfied with the product or service or had him encountered any problems or difficulties.


Resolve the issues immediately if any. A salesperson can also follow-up with his customers periodically or during festive seasons. This can help to build relationship and increase the number of repeated sales or referrals from his existing customers.

Know that the Sniper Approach is good for ""Big Game Hunting.,
Gather and qualify your list.,
Learn more about your prospect.,
Connect with the decision maker.,
Only leave a voice mail as a last resort.,
Consider going through the administrative assistant.,
Follow up.,
Stay in touch.",How to Cold Call Effectively2,"""Using the Sniper is the best way to cold call when you are trying to make larger dollar sales to a smaller group of companies.


The Sniper spends a lot of time on each prospect, to get the perfect sales pitch for each one.
You will typically find a Sniper at companies selling expensive products that need a custom sales pitch for each customer.

, Do this just as if you were a Smile and Dial sales person.

, Once that you identify that a company is a good fit, find more information about the prospect before contacting them.


Have a look at their website and news to get a better feel for the company. Jot down a few key facts that may be useful in your conversation.
Learn all you can about what your buyer is looking for. In addition to web research, you can usually talk to someone fairly low down the corporate ladder to get this information. You can often find them on Linkedin. They will typically be a lot easier to get through to than the decision maker.

, Finally, you are ready to contact your decision maker!


Read over your notes and scripts before calling.
Figure out a good time to call. Many sales reps swear by calling their prospects early in the morning or at the end of the day. Senior executives are extremely busy so catching them before their meetings start for the day or after they finish is your best bet. In addition, you are more likely to get through to them rather than hitting voice mail or getting their assistant. This also leaves the rest of the day for managing your existing clients and active prospects.

, Leaving a message is usually not recommended unless you really can't catch them live.


If you leave a voice mail and they donât respond, how many more can you leave without it seeming like harassment?
If someone does call you back, you may be caught unprepared (what did he say his last name was? What company does he work for? What was the message I left?), this can lead to you feeling flustered and lacking control over the conversation.
If you have tried getting hold of someone for several weeks without success, leave a voice message as a last resort. Put a post it note on your computer screen with the names of people you have left messages for with their company names so that you at least have some advantage and make sure that your script is close at hand.

, Truly, it would nice if there were no administrative assistants and you could get through to the decision maker every time. But, many admins are will be very helpful if you ask them nicely.


Ask the receptionist if your âcontactâ has an assistant; if so, ask for his or her name and enter it in your CRM system.
If reception puts you through to your prospect and you get his or her voice mail, hit â0â to speak to the assistant.
Sound very busy and professional. For example, say âHi Joan, its Fred Smith. I just got John Doeâs voice mail. Is he in the office today?â If she responds with âYes, but heâs in a meeting,â ask what time he is likely to be free.
If the assistant asks what is this about, respond if possible with a single word i.e., âcontrols.â Before he or she gets a chance to ask more, ask if your contact be available later that morning or afternoon. Nine times out of ten the assistant will give you this information, and you will save time by not calling people who are out of the office. If the assistant asks to take a message, you may want to say, âActually, Iâm in and out of meetings all day myself. To avoid telephone tag, Iâll just try John a little later.""
Make sure you keep a good record of the results from your calls. You want to review them before contacting the prospect at a later date, or before any face to face meeting.

, Develop a follow-up system that is foolproof so that you donât have to think about it. If you make a promise to send someone information or say you will call in 2 weeks, then you need some way of tracking that to ensure you donât forget.

, Staying in touch with your prospects is crucial to staying âtop of mind.â After so much hard work, you donât want to risk losing a piece of business because you prospect didnât think about you when they made their decision to buy. Here are a few ideas:


Newsletters are an effective means of staying in touch as long as the information is relevant to the prospect and their industry
Special offers and promotions that are time sensitive
Events and trade show invitations
Holiday cards

"
"
Know that you can use both calls and emails to contact prospects.,
Create your scripts for phone and email.,
Ensure your emails are not violating anti-spam laws.,
Coordinate your email and your phone contact with the customers.",How to Cold Call Effectively3," Increasingly, people don't answer phones; they look at emails. That makes it better to use emails as well. Use the call + email strategy in these situations:


When your prospects are younger. Younger people use phones less that older people.
When you can get a list of prospects that includes their emails. You may simply be able to guess emails correctly by trying something like first initial.lastname@companyname.com. There are also many websites that give you the correct email formats for many companies.

, Use the same strategy you'd use for Smile and Dial. More detailed advice on how to write a marketing email can be found here.

, Emails from one individual to another are not as legally risky as sending thousands at once, but you still need to be careful.


In the USA commercial emails need an unsubscribe option and contact information in them. If someone asks not to be emailed any more, make sure you remove them from your list. You are most likely to be reported if you repeatedly email someone who has asked you to stop.

, Often, a good sales rep will email someone with general information and tell the prospect that they will be calling. That way, you can break the ice by asking the prospect if they received your email.

Be enthusiastic, positive and pleasant to be around, so that your customers and clients feel buoyed up.


Relax and be cheerful. People will respond well to a relaxed and cheerful mood.;
, Know what your products are and do plenty of research into the product background and capacities.

, If you falter, change your attitude, or become easily frustrated, you will appear very fake. Consistency is key.

, Look around you for smart people in every direction; you also need to be smart in order to be the best salesperson. If you want to be a smart salesperson, you should be skilled in communicating effectively, listening, having a good attitude and transparency. One very vital skill you should have is the ability to attract your customers by using your other skills.

, People naturally respond to confidence, and it has a great impact on a customer's decision. Let's pretend that a salesman rings your doorbell and tries to sell you an expensive product right away - and, worse, you already have one! The salesman did not ask important questions, attempt to understand the customer, or even give you a reason to buy the product. People will see through this and see it as arrogance; this sort of approach will not make sales.

, The aim of starting a conversation is to engage the person with the kind of questions that will get the person to talk. This presents you with helpful information about what they really want, what they're prepared to spend and how many compromises they will or won't make.

, Just as people respond to confidence, people are put at ease when you treat them politely and with an open, friendly attitude. Convey to them that you are trying to help them, not make money off of them. This helpful attitude goes a long way.

, Start from where the customer stopped by showing clearly how your product will add value to them, addressing what they lack.

Decide what types of products to sell.,
Become an expert in your product.,
Continue your auction education.,
Get a sales tax number.,
Automate your auctions with an auction management service.,
Build credibility.,
Create a powerful listing.,
Stand behind your product and service.,
Consider advertising on outside sites.",How to Become a Successful eBay Seller," Everyone wants to sell the latest consumer product but the truth is there is a lot of competition from established sellers and even big online companies that have discovered eBay. The best item to sell on eBay is something used or a very specialized (niche) products that few others are selling.


If you are going to sell new goods, make sure you can buy them cheaply enough to sell and make a profit. One source is the closeout and liquidation companies that sell overstocks and seasonal items returned by department stores.
Consider consumables. The idea here is to get repeat business via your web site from customers who buy from you on eBay.
Search Listings on eBay to see what is selling. Go to http://listings.eBay.com to see what is being listed and sold. The number in parentheses after the category title is the number of auctions for a given item. In general, the higher the number the more action and sales.

Find a niche. This will help determine the type of person youâre going to be selling to and the types of product you want to sell. You will also have less competition. Forget trying to sell computers, digital cameras, iPods and plasma TVs. There is no way you can compete with the big guys unless you have tons of money.;
, If you know more about your product area, you will be able to buy at better prices and people who sense you specialize in something will be more comfortable buying from you. When you become an authority in your field, a whole new universe of business and opportunity is opened up to you. People tend to buy certain types of things on eBay from the same sellers over and over.

, Read books and training manuals, visit the chat and message boards, attend an eBay University when it comes to your town, go to eBay Live, and keep learning all the time.

, This will allow you to buy from many wholesale companies that would not deal with you otherwise. If you are not sure who to contact in your state, just call your local chamber of commerce and they will advise you or give you the phone number or web site address to register.

, They provide auction templates where you type in your headlines and text, insert your images, set your price, terms, length of auction and upload your auctions at any time or day you specify. These services also track your inventory and sales, send automated emails to customers, provide a PayPal or credit card gateway and automatically post feedback once payment is received.

, Be trustworthy. Remove every doubt about your credibility. You can do this through presenting yourself positively through your feedback, being passionately devoted to your business and by being an expert. Create a professional About Me Page. A photo of yourself will humanize the online experience can bring amazing results. Your auction headline and item description is where it all begins.

, Your headline is your advertising and your item description is your salesperson. On the web, how you're potential buyer perceives you and your product is everything. Be sure to use power words in your auction title (headline). Rare, Unique, Powerful, New, Unusual, Stunning, Top Notch, First Class, etc. Just be sure not to exaggerate. Donât call something ""rare"" if it is not. A carefully crafted sales letter (item description) can increase you results exponentially without having to spend an extra penny.


Remember that 65% of eBay bidders find what they are looking for by using the search function. Be sure to use carefully chosen and accurate key words in your title and description. eBay gives you 55 characters in your headline. Be sure to use all of them. This will help you get hits. Important keywords include the brand, color, size, and model number.

, Offer an unconditional money-back guarantee on every thing you sell. If you are selling cars or houses, or ""as-is"" used goods that may not be a good idea â but the simple offer of a satisfaction guarantee will dramatically increase your sales. Even unhappy people rarely go to the trouble of sending something back. The cost of providing the few refunds will be far out weighted by the increased volume of your sales. At the very least offer a guarantee that your items are exactly as described and you will give a full refund if they are not. If you have a return policy (and you should) be sure and spell it out clearly at the end of your auction description or in the form eBay gives you to do this.

, Begin advertising on forums or other sites that have members who relate to what you're selling. Just don't spam. Eventually, once you begin making profit, consider pay ads on websites like Facebook.

Identify your target customers.,
Obtain past customer data.,
Build out your customer data.,
Add in referrals.",How to Build a Highly Targeted Prospect List1," Your first task in building a targeted prospect list is defining exactly who you want to to target. Obviously, your target is an entity who will want to buy what you are selling. However, identifying that person or company is somewhat more challenging. Start by looking at your current customers for the product or service you are selling or those who have bought it in the past. What sets them apart from other prospects?


For businesses, identify the locations, industries, sizes, and business models for your best customers. For individuals, look at specific demographic information, including age, income, location, and other information.
Your ideal new prospects will then be similar to these customers.;
, While researching your ideal customer, remember to keep any existing or past customer data you find, as these contacts should become part of your targeted list. Identify past customers, even inactive ones, by examining sales records, correspondence, customer databases, research data, market surveys, and warranty records. Ideally, you should work to get the name, title, email address, and telephone number of each contact.


At this stage, focus on building up your list. You can refine it for accuracy and make sure that it is up to date later., Your list of past or inactive customers will likely have gaps or incorrect information. You can solve this by researching each contact to get their correct and current information. Try using search engines, social networks, and your contacts to get any missing information for prospects. You can also hire a data services company to get this information for you, but this will likely add significant costs to your search., If you have a list of customer referrals, add this in to your prospect list. Customers are likely to refer others who are similar to them, meaning that the referrals will also likely be interested in your offering.If you don't have an existing referrals list, you can devise a way to get referrals from customers. For example, you can include a space in an online survey to recommend the product to a friend or offer incentives to referred customers.

"
"
Utilize your network.,
Analyze prospects on LinkedIn.,
Attract online interest with quality content.,
Use other external sources.",How to Build a Highly Targeted Prospect List2," The next layer of prospects to add to your list should be composed of new customers who you think might be interested in buying. Start by inputting any members of your network who are a close match to your target customer. These can be people you've met at industry events or shows, or just people you've connected with on LinkedIn. Go over your own records and analyze your online network to identify matching prospects., LinkedIn is usually used for building and maintaining professional relationships. However, it can also be used for building up a targeted prospect list. If you're searching for individuals, you can look through your first-degree connections' pages and note the ""people also viewed"" and ""people similar to"" sections on the right side of the page. Scan through the results in each for people in your target industry or company.


You can also perform a company search using the search box at the top of the page. Narrow down your results to first-degree connections. You can then choose other details for your target company, including size and industry.
The results will be your first-degree contacts at these companies. You can then contact them to get contact information for the relevant decision-maker at the company., If your business has a website or blog, you are already building a targeted prospect list composed of your site's visitors. Post interesting, well-written, and shareable content to your site and social media accounts to gain followers and readers. Then, you can have visitors sign up to join your mailing list. At this stage, have them input their information so that you can add them to your prospect list.


Try using giveaways or contests to drive traffic to your site and increase the size of your mailing list.
Only ask for a name and email address for your mailing list. Asking for more information might drive prospects away.
You can also create multiple lists that are specific to certain interests or product categories. This will allow each list to be more focused and can allow for more targeted email campaigns., The above methods are not the only way to build targeted prospect lists. You can also purchase lists from online sellers, for example. Be careful using this method though, as there is no guarantee of the actual quality of these lists. You can also use more labor-intensive, manual methods of data collection, such as going through the Yellow Pages, company websites, or industry/trade directories to identify potential prospects. While this approach might take much longer, you can at least be assured of the quality of your information."
"
Segment your prospects.,
Use data to track prospects.,
Narrow down corporate targets into executive contacts.,
Verify your list's content.",How to Build a Highly Targeted Prospect List3," Regardless of how focused your list already is, you can likely split up prospects using certain criteria to make it even more focused. Segmentation is the process of dividing up your prospects, using demographic information for individuals, business descriptors for companies, or purchase information for either of them. Your segmentation decisions should be aimed at creating a list that conforms to your ideal customer.


You can segment individuals using geographic information or demographic information, such as gender, income, age, profession, marital status, interests, or other qualities.
Businesses can divided into categories based on their size, business type, annual sales/expenditures, or other qualities.
Either group can be divided based on order recency (in the last six months, for example), order frequency, average order size, annual purchase amount, or simply if they have made a purchase from you at all., Set up marketing automation tools like Pardot, Hubspot, and Leadlander to track visitors to your website. These services will allow you to see who is visiting your site and what, specifically, they are viewing. You can then match these visitors to your website to see who among them is most interested in your product or service. Reaching out to prospects who have already visited your site is likely to result in better leads.You can do the same thing with your emails to your list if you are using an email marketing platform. Track views and click-through rates and match interest to your prospect list., If you have identified a list of strong company prospects, you'll need to convert your list into actual human contacts at each company. Use LinkedIn and an internet search engine to identify the relevant decision-makers at each company. If possible, identify between 5 and 20 important possible decision-makers for each prospect. Then, utilize your own LinkedIn network to see if any of your connections can introduce you., To have a complete list, you'll need to go through it and eliminate any gaps, errors, or duplicates. Start by searching through for duplicate entries of the same prospects. These might be mentioned in different ways, so look closely. Then, try to fill in any gaps in your information, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses. Finally, try to ascertain whether or not the information you have is correct. Check your information against other sources to make sure its right and up to date."

In addition to a strong skill set and confidence in your abilities, youâll need to be able to rely on yourself to be your own boss.The most important aspect of being a successful independent sales rep is the ability to motivate yourself. Remember that self-employment requires an incredible amount of discipline.
Be aware that, especially when youâre just starting out, you will likely work more than 40 hours per week. As you build your product portfolio and client base, you should be comfortable with working closer to 60 hours per week.
Youâll need strong time management skills in order to maximize your efficiency and make the most of your time.;
, Ideally, if youâre thinking of becoming an independent sales rep, you have excellent oral and written communication skills. You should be able to target the way you communicate to different audiences. You should also be able to easily find compromises that benefit parties on either side of a sales deal.Think about taking a writing course at a local community college. Focus on learning to write for different audiences. Ask any friends or family who write well to go over grammar and style rules with you.
Try taking on a part-time service job, such as in retail, as a restaurant server, or answering a customer service phone line. Improve your oral communications skills by paying close attention to how your customers speak and act. Pay attention to how you speak to your customers, and try to target how you communicate to the various people you encounter.
An independent sales agent is responsible for making the productâs manufacturer happy and satisfying the buyerâs needs. Since theyâre responsible for their own income management, an independent rep must also fit their own satisfaction into the equation.
Strong interpersonal and problem solving skills are absolutely necessary in order to land a deal that benefits these various parties.

, Independent sales reps are typically highly experienced, with years of employment in a particular field under their belt. Having significant experience in sales gives you a knowledge base about products or a specific market, helps you develop the skills necessary to be a great sales agent, and typically gives you a robust client base.If you don't have any sale experience, think about applying for an sales job on a company's in-house team to learn and master the basics.
If you have a background in sales, decide which products and industries you know best as you select which company or product line youâd like to represent as an outside agent.
If youâre currently employed with a company as an in-house sales agent, consider your available opportunities. If you think a promotion is possible in the near future, or if you believe you could learn more about the industry or strengthen your network, consider remaining in your current position for several months or a year before becoming an independent rep., Donât reinvent the wheel if you donât have to: think about who and what you already know. Before you decide to become an independent rep consider if your network is heavy in a given industry and therefore includes lots of potential buyers.Before you go with a particular company or product, think about what would be easiest to sell. If you spent a long time in the food industry and know people in purchasing at restaurants and grocery stores, consider selling food, beverages, or spirits, or products associated with food service.

, Read books, attend seminars, and take on-site or online courses. Ask around your network and seek guidance from other successful salespeople. Ask about pros and cons from experienced independent sales agents.


Consider joining a relevant professional organization for manufacturers and independent sales agents, such as MANA: https://www.manaonline.org/

Think about joining a trade association for individual industries that you might have experience with, like food service or HVAC., Most independent sales reps only need a home office space and reliable automobile in order to work.While these are the most obvious aspects of your startup costs, you should nonetheless consider all potential costs of operating your independent career, from paying for the internet to acquiring a professional wardrobe to paying for business cards.


Consider the visual impact of your car. You will like find little success if you drive up to a manufacturing company or to a potential buyer with a beat-up, barely drivable car.
Remember that since youâre self-employed, thereâs no company-provided office supply closet to raid, especially when youâre just starting. Later down the road, youâll likely get reimbursed for expenses after youâve secured a relationship with the company whose products youâre selling.

, While startup costs are low, it can take time before you earn an income that will support you or your family. When youâre just starting out, make sure you have a significant amount of money saved, at least enough to cover the majority of living expenses for up to six months. Alternatively, work a part-time job to cover your living expenses as you start your new career.


If you are married or have a family, make sure your spouse or other family members understand the monetary sacrifices that come with starting any new career.Have a conversation with your spouse about setting a long-term budget, cutting expenses, and about any potential travel or time away from home that your new career will entail.

, Itâs always easiest to stick with the industries you know best. In addition to your existing knowledge base, think about your location as you search for a manufacturer or products to sell. Find out if an industry or particular brand dominates your geographic location, so that you wonât have to spend extra effort creating a new market share.For example, if everyone in your area knows a brand, its logo, and what products it makes, you should spend some time researching that brand to see how it sells its products. Look on their website to see if they have an in-house sales force or use independent agents.
If youâve spent years as automotive technician and know every product a mechanic would ever need like the back of your hand, look for companies that produce those products. Search their websites to find out how they sell their products.

, Once you have a pool of companies you'd like to work with, look on their sites for job postings for independent sales reps. Input the company name onto your preferred job search website. Expand your search to any postings for independent sales reps in your area.


Even if you canât find any open independent positions, write a letter or email of interest to the human resources department or to any sales executives or supervisors listed on their website. Be sure to mention your expertise and experience in addition to your sincere interest in selling their products.
Ask around your network, especially if you have a background in a given industry. Think about anyone you might know who can point you in the direction of a job prospect, such as someone who works for a manufacturing company or for a software developer.
Your chamber of commerce may also be able to lead you to local businesses who are in need of independent sales reps.

, A sales commission is the percentage of money made from a sale that forms your income. As an independent sales agent, your income will be entirely commissions-based. While thereâs no set formula, and commissions are always negotiable, selling manufactured products typically generates 7 to 15% of the saleâs value. Selling services, such as software, typically yields a commission rate of 20 to 50% of sales.Services generate higher rates because you generally need more expertise if youâre selling something like software, and because manufactured products generally cost more to produce.
Always negotiate your commission rate when youâre starting out with a new company. Donât take their first offer. Say, â9% is a little beneath the expected threshold for this product. 14% is a more appropriate rate.â Expect to meet somewhere in the middle.

, Once youâve successfully made contact with a manufacturer, youâll need to demonstrate to them that you have ample experience as a professional salesperson. Interview processes vary, and you may or may not sign a contractual agreement. Once you agree to work with a company, theyâll provide you with any training you need in order to successfully sell their product.When you start representing a companyâs product, youâll then spend most of your time making phone calls to potential buyers, visiting trade shows, or making in-person demonstrations in order to land sales.
Once youâve begun selling one product or product line, itâll be easier to add other, related products to your portfolio. Youâll likely have signed a contract with a non-competitive clause, so be sure that any new products that you add to your portfolio are not in direct competition with your previous product.
In other words, never sell two of the same thing, especially if you could get in trouble for it.

, When signing a contract to sell a company's product or service, it's important to read and understand its terms. Try to make sure it avoids ambiguity, addresses renewal, termination, and is open to amendments or changes.When it comes to renewal, a great contract will give both parties the opportunity to exit the contract upon renewal. Avoiding automatic renewal helps to guarantee your relationship with the supplier is based on both parties' performances. Consider showing your contract to your lawyer, obtaining a standard rep contract from your industry's trade association, or asking around your network for advice.
Try to negotiate a contract that allows for termination for cause and for convenience. This means that you'll have to option to back out of the contract (typically with 30 days notice) if you need to without the threat of a legal skirmish. Make sure both sides are on equal footing and that either can terminate the partnership.
The best representative contracts allow changes to be made at any time or at regular intervals throughout the year.
Make sure any contract you sign defines what happens after termination. Make sure it defines how many days notice a party must give and determines how commissions are calculated. For example, if you've earned a commission on shipments that are sent after the date of termination, make sure the contract states that you're to be paid what you're due after termination. You and the supplier should both document all sales that earn you commission following the contract's termination date.

, Check with your state or national government's business regulatory agency to find out what type of licensing is required for you to practice as an independent sales rep in your area. Make your business as professional as possible:


Design a simple logo or ask for help from graphic designer friends.
Hand out business cards and other informational materials that are appropriate for your industry.

, Create a website that lists your available products, credentials, and contact information. Set up and manage social networking accounts. Contribute to industry-related online forums, and create a blog.


Be sure to include a link back to your website in all of your forum, blog and social networking posts.

, Always be on the lookout for more potential buyers and new markets. Keep yourself educated about your chosen industry so that you can be a more competitive and attractive potential sales agent for both manufacturers and buyers.Attend conferences, seminars and trade shows related to the industry you are interested in and approach vendors about possible independent sales opportunities.
Attend networking events. Find events related to your industry in the local classifieds, in the community section of classifieds sites like Craigslist and on websites like Meetup.com. Meet as many people as you can, hand out business cards and follow-up with useful contacts.
Advertise your independent sales rep offerings in newspapers, magazines, trade publications, classifieds websites and industry-related web directories. For example, if you choose to represent a computer hardware manufacturer, you can advertise in technology magazines and in the technology section of your local newspaper.

, As you continue to grow your customer base and become a more reputable presence in your industry, you might find yourself ready to hire others to work for you. Before starting a multi-person agency, think about how reputable and reliable your services and accounts have been to date. Donât think about expanding unless you have multiple accounts that you know for a fact will continue to be good sources of revenue.When expanding your business, craft a business plan with reasonable expectations and specific objectives. Designate specific accounts or products that youâll delegate to new hires. Use these estimates to decide how many sub-agents you should hire.
Set specific goals for your new hires and their assigned accounts. Using your past income, forecast conservative expectations for commissions generated.
When added sub-agents to your business, focus on customer service. Make sure that anyone you add to your team will deliver the same high quality service that brought you success."

One level floor
Wood frame
Square or rectangular shape
Main roofline extends over the porch or sidewalk
Hipped or gabled roof

, Genuine houses built from scratch by the standards of this architecture should have the following patterns:


Small storage spaces at the rear
A sleeping area in the attic
Four adjoining rooms - one room in each corner of the house
No interior halls

"
Look at the front of the house.,
Identify the main features from outside:



Timber frame with brick or ""bousillage"" (mud combined with moss and animal hair)
wide hipped roof extends over porches
thin wooden columns
living quarters raised above ground level
wide porches, called ""galleries""

french doors (doors with many small panes of glass)

Identify the legal parties who will sign the contract.,
Check for deviations in wording.Errors in wording can render your contract null and void, which can lead to legal repercussions down the road.If you are dealing with a company that uses a fictional name, this information should be included along with the full legal name of the company with which you are doing business.,
Verify that you are using the correct legal entity.,
Re-confirm the terms of contract and sign.",How to Close a Deal," You'll need a comprehensive knowledge of your product or service, but you should also know which facets of your product or service your client is most interested in. Have a list of key features that sets your product apart from the rest, and avoid giving a presentation that is generic and doesn't engage your audience.You might also read up on how to deliver a good pitch. You can prepare for your pitch by:


Making an appointment to meet with clients and give your pitch.
Adjusting your product presentation to meet client expectations.
Grooming, if necessary (haircut, manicure, etc.).
Choosing your clothing for the meeting.
Mapping out your route to the meeting.;
, You don't want to waste your valuable time during the workday pursuing a deal that a client can't afford. If you are meeting with a representative of an established company, you should look into the business history of that company.This may involve:


Investigating profit making/spending trends
Checking stock history (for large companies)

, Take every opportunity you have to test and refresh yourself on the organization of your pitch. You may want to practice your opening in the car, or review product information while in the elevator. The night and morning before your pitch, look over your outline and information, both to review and to be certain that your materials are well organized.

, You might feel a little self conscious talking about money or compensation early in your presentation. However, by clearly stating the terms of your deal and your expectations, you can save yourself from spending time and effort trying to close a client that isn't willing or able to meet the conditions of your deal., In your mind you should have a clear idea of the order in which you will present your product or service. Identify any areas that seem weak, or even areas a similar product might surpass your own, and think of how you might address these points with your client.Stay confident under pressure and make the best use of your prospect's time. From the moment you arrive, you're on the spot to perform.
A firm handshake and a warm smile are important, but avoid too much small talk. Look your potential client in the eye and get down to business.

, All potential deals have a something in common: there's a decision to be made. While a ""yes"" from a junior executive or assistant may not be the final step, your job is to get to the next decision maker. After you have made your pitch, ask if the terms of the deal are acceptable and any additional steps that need to be taken.


Subordinates are great allies. If you are respectful and convincing, they may accept you as part of the team and want to help you succeed in closing the deal.
An initial ""no"" doesn't always mean your deal will fall through. ""No,"" in some cases, can indicate that your client is interested in negotiating terms of your deal.

, To be sure the terms and expectations of each part of your deal are acceptable to both parties and understood, you should address each point of your deal one by one. Larger deals can take several meetings to clarify the terms and language of the deal.By patiently addressing each aspect of your deal, you can help prevent your client from backing out last minute with the excuse, ""I didn't know.""

, The ability to control the mood is the hallmark of a great closer. In most cases, your prospect will prefer a confident and light attitude. But always be aware of the atmosphere. Humor can be a powerful tool for building rapport, but can sometimes be inappropriate.Practice using and reading body language. You can best control the direction of the presentation by avoiding confrontational words and moves. Your prospect will respond most positively if he sees you as an ally, not an adversary.

, This technique is also called the ""assumptive close."" With this technique, the goal is to ask your client a question that, when answered, serves as passive agreement to the deal.Be careful if you employ this closing maneuver, as inexpert use might make you appear manipulative. Some examples phrases you might use for an assumptive close are:


Who should I forward this contract to?
Can you think of any reason that, if we remained at this price, might prevent your company from doing business with ours?

, Once the client has agreed to the timetable, you can arrange deadlines according to both parties' schedules.


This strategy is very useful as a stepping stone to the final closing of a deal as well.Once a timetable has been set, you should check in with your client to see that in between steps are being finished in time for closing.

, This is a very safe technique to employ, as it does not come across as manipulative.If your pitch has gone well, at the end of your presentation you might simply say:


""I believe I've answered all your questions. If you don't have any more, shall we move forward?""

, Even if the legal team of your company has prepared the contract you will be using, it's best to at least skim the document to make sure it is the contract you need and all necessary components are in place.Every contract should have:


An offer.
An acceptance of the offer.
Sufficient and clear ""consideration"" as to the exchange that will occur with the acceptance of the offer., Legally, this may include a person authorized to bind a company to an agreement, a corporation, or a limited liability company (LLC). Clearly determine who will be signing the contract and whether or not that person has the legal ability to sign your contract., An example of this might look like:


This agreement, dated March 12, 2016, is between ACME INDUSTRIES, INC., a Michigan corporation, and JOHN SMITH CONSULTING, INC., an Ohio corporation doing business as the Consult Expert.

, An unaware business owner or client might not know the consequences of using a fictional business name or using an imprecise Doing Business As (DBA) company name. A sole proprietorship, as an example, is not separate from its owner in legal terms.Check and be sure that you have the correct full name for the company or legal entity you are signing a contract with.


Company names and DBAs can be checked at the Secretary of State, or in the state records of the state the company was formed. Many of these searches can be done online for free, though some states may charge a small fee., Take a moment before signing to go over the terms of your contract with the signing party. Double check that the person signing is the legally correct person to enter into a contract with you. Once the terms are approved, have all necessary properties sign and date the contract."

Don't get discouraged.",How to Be Successful Making Telephone Sales," Put all of your information, including a script if you have one, in front of you in a neat and organized way. Read through it before you start; the time spent learning what is in it will pay off when you can answer questions easily and quickly. Make sure your immediate environment is free of distractions and that you are comfortable in your chair.


Some people find that they are more comfortable making sales calls while standing. If you choose to sit, make sure your chair is comfortable and ergonomic.Consider placing reminders for yourself around your workspace, like a note that says ""focus on the customer"" or ""it's not about me."" This can help remind you of your goals during the call.;
, Find what works best for you to help build up your belief that you can succeed in as many calls as possible. Perhaps you can use a mantra, repeating over and over the words ""sell, sell, sell."" Or perhaps you need total calm and just go to that place where you can home in on your confidence. Perhaps you can play a game with yourself and pretend that the fate of the world depends on your hitting the sales targets.


Try visualizing how you want the recipients of your calls to hear and imagine you. Work towards living up to that goal. Try to cultivate trustworthiness, confidence, and intelligence in your voice.It may help you to emulate a role model of yours when you make calls. That is, try to take on the confidence of a famous personality or business leader, specifically those who are convincing and always cool-headed., Keep water or energy drinks within reaching distance. That way, you will be able to keep your voice in great shape even though you are doing a lot of talking. In addition, you should take breaks regularly to keep your mind and voice fresh., In your team, prepare a chart that notes who has made the most calls (or sales). Everyone can chip in some money and the winner gets movie tickets, a night at the pub, whatever. If the supervisor or manager can pitch in something additional, such as a night on the town, that would be a huge incentive. Talk to your boss about the possibility.


Try to create your own targets for yourself even if no group contest exists. Set this goal above and beyond any goals the company has set for you., Rather than just saying ""hello"" or immediately starting on your pitch, start your call by greeting the recipient professionally. Use the recipients name in your greeting, trying to remain as formal as possible. For example, try ""Good morning/evening, mr./mrs./ms. ____."" Afterwards, immediately introduce yourself by name and introduce your business.


Use only your first name, unless you are the owner of the business.
Say briefly what your business can do for them, but not exactly what you offer. For example, say ""we save local businesses money"" instead of ""we offer cheap accounting services.""
This makes the recipient curious about exactly how you can save them money., In many cases, you will have a standard script to follow. However, it can be difficult to read off the script directly with any real fluidity, and you may lose your place if you are interrupted. To remedy this problem, memorize your script but only keep a list of key points in front of you. This will help you pick up your place and make your speech more natural., Thank them for taking your call. Promise that you won't waste their precious time and that you will soon let them get back to their busy schedule., Bring up the reason for your call as a question, like ""would you be interested in a product that you could lower your accounting costs while maintaining the same quality?"" Focus on what your product can do for them, not the product itself.If you're not talking to someone who can make business decisions, keep working until you get to them.
Use questions to assess the prospect's needs and identify how your product or service can remedy them., When pitching your product or service, focus on the benefits you can provide your customer. Tell them how it can save them time or money, increase profits, or improve their lives and happiness. It may help to explain what your product has done for others, with numbers to back this up.


If possible, describe your benefits in the same language (the same terms) in which your prospect described their problems. This builds trust between you., Have your prospect commit to a meeting for more information or to see your product or service in action. Ideally, you'd close the sale over the phone, but in many cases this is just not possible. If nothing else, encourage them to consider your proposition and give them contact information so that they can reach you if they decide they want to know more., Practice your speech and arguments with a coworker, your boss, or with anyone who will practice with you. Tell them how to act, for example as a cold call recipient or current customer. After your conversation, ask about anything you can improve on. Take this criticism to heart and make an effort to make changes. For example, rewrite your script if some parts don't flow well or are phrased in strange ways., Prospects will be irritated, or at least less willing to listen, if you call at the wrong times. For example, never call on Monday mornings or Friday afternoons. However, most people will answer if you call before 8:30 a.m. In addition, calls on days with inclement weather are more likely to be successful. Experiment with different times yourself; you may find that some times of day result in more successful calls than others., Even the best product will not be attractive to someone who doesn't need it. Focus your calls at prospects who may actually be interested in your business. Take it a step further and research your prospects before calling. Explore how your service or product might be of particular use to them. Write down ways you can connect your offerings to your prospect's needs., Create a system to keep track of prospective customers you have already called and spoken to. Make a note of any meetings you have set up with these customers. Send a short and sweet confirmation email the day before the meeting. For those customers who said they would consider your offer or get back to you, keep a record of the date of your first call and call them again a week or so later. Maintain a list either on paper or in a spreadsheet program so that this information is easily accessible., It is unlikely you will seal the sale after one call. Instead, you should focus on creating a relationship between you and the prospect. Fulfill promises that you make, like with meetings or return calls. Make the potential customer see you as friendly and trustworthy. This will improve your chances of eventually making a sale., You will get a lot of no's, excuses and even hang-ups. Quantity is the key; it is all a numbers game. It doesn't feel good when you get rejected, but it feels great when you get the appointment or sale! Think of how you want to be approached over the phone as well. Try to say things you would want to hear as a consumer at the other end of the phone.


Some prospects may need to be called many times before they will bite. Don't give up!
Don't worry about unreasonable or rude people on the other end of the phone, just clear it from your mind and move on."

However, if you want to dramatically alter the appearance of your residence, such as changing the faÃ§ade or adding another wing, a licensed architect may be the best person to lead the project.;
, If you know someone whose home has recently undergone major construction work, such as adding a second floor, an architect was probably utilized.


Visit the project to inspect the construction quality. Ask the property owner if the materials used are durable and if they tolerate everyday use.
Check with the property owner to see if the architect was easy to work with. You'll also want to know if the project was completed on time and if the architect stayed within budget. If not, find out why; sometimes timelines and budgets are exceeded because of unforeseen project complications, not bad decision-making by the architect.
Get the architect's contact information if you like what you hear.

, Since many charge for a consultation, ask about their prices for your first meeting.

, Look for design elements that you want in your own project, such as window placement and room layouts.


Ask about any project complications and how the architect handled them. If a project went over budget, ask why and inquire about how the situation was resolved.

, Always have extra funding set aside for construction project overruns. Generally, 25 percent more money is enough to cover extra expenses.

, If you require the assistance of someone who can navigate the process of applying for construction permits with your town, make sure the architect is aware of your needs. Some architects include project management in their fee structure, others consider it an extra service and charge accordingly.

, Larger firms sometimes send lead architects to initial meetings but later assign a junior architect to work with clients.


Always interview the same people you will work with to ensure you communicate effectively as a team.

, Know how much money the architect expects to spend on your project. Ask about extra fees for project changes and re-designs.

Familiarize yourself with the scale of the drawings.,
Understand the basic symbols used in the engineering drawings.,
Look for circled numbers.,
Identify specific abbreviations.,
Work with colleagues.",How to Read Engineering Drawings,"


Understanding how large or small certain items are essential when reading engineering drawings. While most engineering drawings are created in ""scale"" versions of 1/4-1/8 inches (.55-.275 centimeters) per foot, other scales may be used for very large creations. Always determine the scale of the drawing before examining it in detail. If the scale is not obviously evident on the drawing, consult with the engineer who drew it for clarification.;
,


As these drawings are done on such a small scale, the use of symbols is often required. While many symbols exist, understanding a few of the basics can be very helpful when reading engineering drawings. Some of the most common symbols used in these drawings include rectangles, circles, and triangles. As with determining the scale, consulting with the engineer who created the drawing can provide great insight as to the symbols used.

,


As discussed previously, engineering drawings are typically done on a scale so small that creating detail is almost impossible. Because of this, engineers often add circled numbers to certain parts of the drawings. These circled numbers indicate that the area identified is shown in greater detail on another page.

,


Abbreviations are a useful tool for engineers. Like symbols, they can indicate shapes, processes, and even dimensions through a few letters. Some of the most common abbreviations used in engineering drawings include DP, which stands for depth, and DIA, which stands for diameter.

,


When all else fails, consult with other professionals to better clarify the drawings. While it may be embarrassing to admit that you are having difficulty interpreting the drawing, those who regularly work with and understand the drawings will help you read them. Ask ""in the know"" individuals on the project to clarify anything you do not understand; better that this happens in the early stages of a project than to encounter a mistake farther into a project because of improperly reading engineering drawings.

You can review these requirements through the TBAE website, or request accreditation information form universities during the application process. Your interior designer degree must come from an institution accredited by either the CIDA or the NAAB., To become a registered interior designer, you can obtain a baccalaureate, masterâs, or doctoral degree. If you already have a baccalaureate degree in another field, you can also complete an interior design associates degree or certification program. Review the educational requirements as put in place by the state of Texas here http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/fids/201201631-1.html .


Associate degrees or certification programs in interior design offer the minimal number of credit hours necessary to understand the main concepts of interior design, and combined with the additional year of field experience, this is often a great option for those who are starting second careers or who would otherwise prefer to enter the workforce more quickly.
A baccalaureate degree in interior design will offer you the necessary course work and experience, and this is typically the only level education necessary to be a successful interior designer.A masterâs degree in interior design gives you an advantage over other designers. If youâre in a competitive market, an MA or MS degree may be a good option.
A doctoral degree is typically only sought by those designers who wish to work for larger planning and environment departments, who would like to teach interior design, or who would like to take a leadership role within the field as political representatives or leaders in professional organizations., In most cases, you meet the interior design experience requirement with six months working in the field or by serving a 2-year internship, following your baccalaureate degree from an accredited university. If you have a degree at any level from a non-accredited university or a degree in another field, you can still qualify to register for the exam by obtaining three years of experience. Youâll also need to spend a specific number of hours on various topics.Youâll need to complete 3,520 experience hours for your six month on-the-job requirements and 5,280 hours for the two year internship.

Provide a brief description of your job functions when listing work experience.
Cater your resume to the job youâre applying for. Go through and add in references about how your education and experience make you a good candidate for this particular job.

, This will show your potential internship supervisor or employer what youâve learned. The portfolio will be reviewed as part of almost any interview, and many employers require the portfolio with the application and resume. Include projects you completed as part of your course work that received high marks from professors. Even if a project did not receive a high grade, if you feel it shows your skill as an artist and designer, include it in your portfolio.Decide whether youâre going to use a digital or print portfolio. If you do use a digital portfolio, bring your own computer or tablet to interviews. Donât expect this to be provided.
If your professor suggested changes or improvements for any of your designs, complete those before adding it to your portfolio.
Try to tell a story with your portfolio. Donât just put photos together. Include captions and take time to organize the projects in a meaningful way. For instance, you could walk through a home with complete designs for each room as if itâs a real estate tour.
Include designs, photos, sketches, and anything else you think may be important to tell your story., Many students and employees wait until after they graduate or move to another job to request letters of reference from their supervisors. However, itâs a good practice to keep a number of letters on hand to include as part of applications to supplement your resume.


If youâve particularly enjoyed a class, ask your professor, âWould you be willing to write me a good letter of recommendation to include in my professional portfolio?â
If youâre completing your experience component, ask your supervisors to complete a letter of reference for you.

, Apply at the Interior Design Experience Program (IDEP) that is administered by the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ).

Add any Conclusions:

Put in a nutshell your findings about the general topic, question, or relationship in one or two sentences.",How to Write an Engineering Abstract2," It should define the objectives, importance and context for the study. This is typically done in one or two sentences that tell of the overall topic and its significance. A clear-cut way of doing this is by associating the reason you carried out these experiments with your particular area of research.
For example: âArtery biomechanics may play an important role during the development of atherosclerosis. Artery stiffness is used clinically to predict atherosclerosis risk; however, laboratory testing of whole arteries has produced ambiguous results. Atherosclerotic plaques extend through only part of the vessel wall; consequently, an accurate description of the biomechanics of atherosclerosis will require testing of local mechanical properties.â (Biomedical Engineering: Method to Expose Arterial Sub endothelium for Indentation Testing by John M. Peloquin; Advisor: Cynthia Reinhart-King)

, Take account of the hypothesis and objective or goal of the research.
For example: âThe mechanical properties of the intimal subendothelium likely change as atherosclerosis progresses. To facilitate testing this hypothesis, we sought to develop a method to remove artery endothelium and expose the intimal subendothelium for indentation testing.â

, There is no need to give ample detail; keep it brief and to-the-point.
For example: âWe evaluated and refined three methods from the literature: 1) filter paper imprinting, 2) soaking in saponin solution, and 3) gentle scraping with a cotton applicator.â

, Be sure to only include the key points that concern the objective you have mentioned.
For example: âScanning electron microscopy and histology results show that scraping is the most effective method, achieving almost complete de-endothelialization. Immunohistochemistry experiments suggest that scraping specifically exposes the internal elastic lamina.â

, Be clear in describing how the results have contributed to the domain of the paperâs content.
For example: âScraping is an effective and reproducible method to remove arterial endothelium and expose the intimal subendothelium. This result is an important prerequisite for high-resolution indentation testing to ascertain the role of subendothelial mechanics in atherosclerosis.â

Keep in mind that your delivery, including your diction and flow, has to do a lot with the readers' insight of your work. Effectual structure, precise grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and writing mechanism are imperative features of a successful abstract., Do not make your abstract too length, and too short. In this case, aim for around 300 words.,Â Asking someone to look over your abstract is the best way to make sure it is clear enough for them to follow and identify your efficiency of representing the content of your paper. Tell them to report what they thought was unclear or the abstract was lacking. This way, you will be able to portray your main ideas in the most understandable way.

Move on to devices with increasing complexity.,

Look at the function.,

Perform a ""dissection"".,
Understand basic machine elements.,
Look at systems and subsystems within a machine.,

Follow the path of the energy.,

Build your own machines and models.",How to Understand How Machines Work," Many everyday objects are simple machines. Take a good look, if you haven't lately, at how a retractable ball-point pen extends and then retracts when you push and release the button. Here are some other familiar objects to examine:





  A system of levers.

Stapler




 Another system of levers.

Nail clippers




 A simple pump. Save one the next time you run out.

Trigger spray bottle
Tape measure




 The old kind.

Eggbeater




 The kind of clasp on jars like these.

Draw clasp;
, Faucets, toilets, vacuum cleaners, bicycles, and electric toothbrushes are a few items you may have around with intermediate complexity., What action does this machine or mechanism perform? Work backwards to see how it performs that function., Open up the device and look inside to see how it works. The next time you see a small appliance headed for the trash, open it up and see what makes it tick.,





 Pulleys.

Start with the classical simple machines: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. Simple machines exchange distance for force, or vice versa.
Move on to understand parts of modern machines, too, such as gears, electric motors, and the internal combustion engine.






Learn about electricity, too. Most machines these days are electromechanical.

, Rather than try to understand the entire engine in a car, start by understanding just one part, such as the clutch or the brakes. Then, learn how the systems work together., Follow this path from either direction. Start with the energy source (fuel, electrical plug) and follow it through the motor and gears, or start with the action (such as the wheels or mixer blades) and trace it backwards through the machine., Make a kinetic sculpture. Build a roller coaster for a marble. Model a crank and slider mechanism in wood or cardboard."

Analyse the structures of things.",How to Think Like an Engineer," This is a forerunner of most engineering practice, having lots of knowledge of how different mechanisms work in relation to one another makes it easier to think about things in engineering terms. Any time someone explains to you how things work, take an interest and don't be scared to ask questions.;
, Wireframes help people to visualise what the finished machine will look like; being able therefore to visualise a wireframe or superimpose it mentally onto an object allows you to plan all of the working parts within it.

, What is the purpose of the machine? Yes it must work, butÂ even if a machine works it is pointless if it does not have a use. Being able to identify potential uses for machines allows you to both repurpose old machines to new tasks and think of upgrades to existing machines.

, This is similar to visualising wireframes except here you are visualising the matter of the subject - which involves all three solids liquids and gasses. the easier it is for you to visualise these things the easier it will be to create them in real life.

,Â Most complex mechanisms are nothing more than a collection of simple mechanisms all working together, and so understanding how the simple mechanisms work makes it easier to think about complex mechanisms.

, Engineering is one of the few places where mathematics such as algebra is often seeing at work. By learning the equations for things and why they are in that way you can better understand how the mechanism relates to itself and how exactly it is accomplishing its task, as well as what it is doing along every step of the way. Learning even basic math is wholly beneficial.

, If there is a car that can do 180mph, think of ways you can make it do 280mph. If there is an aeroplane that can fly across the atlantic using Â (x) amount of fuel, think on ways you can make it fly across the atlantic using (>x) amount of fuel. This is where it is very useful to know the numerical limits of things.

, Da Vinci, in his time, sought to accomplish self powered cars and in turn he produced a viable concept based on storing energy in powerful springs - the cars were not very efficient due to his creative insights being limited by the technology at the time, but his designs were by far the most high tech thoughts of that period. Think what tasks need accomplishing today that can be done so with technology and begin working out concepts using your creative thinking to complete that task.

, Drone technology, the chemical compound graphene, quantum computers; these things will provide both inspiration and technology for the construction of even greater technological innovation. By keeping up to date, you allow yourself to be close to the forefront of discovery.

, Nature is often thought of as having the simplest and most direct designs, The insights an engineer could deduce from looking at the muscles of a tiger or the wings of a bird, or the legs of an insect could perhaps advance the human race tremendously in a short period of time. All it takes is for an engineer to turn a natural form into a mechanical one.

, Studying engineering books can show you that others are both interested in the same things as you and also that people have discovered knowledge which may prove very beneficial to you in what you design and build.

, Having a knowledge of the materials available to you both elemental and compound can provide you with what you need to build what you want to build. Sometimes a problem that would be difficult to solve in a mechanical way can be solved by nothing more than changing one of the materials used to either lower the weight, conduct more electricity or provide the necessary density to make the machine function.

, Everything from buildings to cars to natural forms in nature, by observing the structures you see which parts are taking the load and which parts are aesthetic only. This helps in your ability to manufacture mechanism housing and even manufacture new materials by applying your insights at a more microscopic level.

Understand you're not looking for a job; you're offering your services.,
Familiarize yourself with the company, what it does, and the products it sells.,
If you know someone who works at the company already, by all means contact them!,
Understand that if you want a specific job, but don't know the language used, you can still get the job!,
Many companies these days will screen candidates by phone before inviting them to a face-to-face interview.,
The initial phone screen may be conducted by a non-technical person.,
If you pass the first screen (or there isn't one), next comes the engineering screen.,
In this and all interviews, make sure you understand the question!,
If you passed the engineering screen (or there wasn't one), the next step will be the in-person interview.,
Get a good night's sleep the night before, and eat a good breakfast.

,
Always wear a suit (or similarly conservative dress for a woman) to an interview unless you have been specifically told otherwise.,
Be on time for the interview, or a few minutes early.,
The person you will meet first is often someone from Human Resources.,
During your interviews, try to be emotionally centered and relaxed.,
Programming questions tend to start off easy and get harder as you progress.,
Architecture and design questions tend to be naturally looser, and imaginative solutions count for a lot.,
Some questions may involve solving logic puzzles that aren't programming-specific.,
If you're given a question already asked by a previous interviewer at the company, inform them of that immediately!,
It's OK to say ""I don't know"" to an interviewer's question, but you should never leave it at that.,
When offered something to drink (water, soda, coffee, tea), say yes.,
Ask engineers about their responsibilities and what they like about the company.

,
Ask managers about the company, the products you'd be working on, and their ""management style"".,
Don't be afraid to ask for feedback from an interviewer at the end of a session.

,
Save questions about benefits for HR.,
At this stage, a few companies may be ready to make you an offer.,
The second interview may involve more engineers, but more often involves your boss's boss, their boss, and a longer session with HR.,
When asked about salary, if you're a new graduate, just ask for ""a competitive offer"".

,
For someone more experienced, give a salary range if pressed for a number.,
It's OK to answer the question, ""What was your most recently salary?"",
Always ask for stock options!

,
If, by leaving your present position, you'd lose your vacation seniority, ask for the same number of vacation days per year to start.

,
It's especially good if you have an offer from another company.,
When the company makes you an offer (yay!,
Most of all, good luck!

",How to Interview for a Software Engineering Position," Companies aren't interested in giving you a job per se. They have a situation of some kind and want to know if you can provide the solution.


Sometimes the situation may be, """"we're looking for good all-around programming ability""""; more often than it's """"do you have significant experience with language X (Java, Python, C++) or field Y (CAD, networking, embedded systems)?"""" Some knowledge in algorithms like big O notation often comes in handy in many cases.;
, Think about how you could be an asset to the company.

, Knowing someone at a company means you already have someone who can vouch for you, and is a great advantage.

, How? By learning the language yourself, and demonstrating your knowledge to the employer.


If you already know a few languages, one more is usually just variations on a theme. An experienced engineer learning a new language is often more valuable to a company than a recent graduate with a couple of years experience. Doing so also demonstrates self-reliance, always a positive trait for an engineer.

, This saves the company a lot of time, as many candidates who ""look good on paper"" cannot otherwise answer basic questions.

, They are looking for answers that match the ones they've been given by engineers. They will not understand subtlety, so don't bother with other than straightforward answers.

, Your interviewer will be either the group manager or another engineer. You may be given programming problems to solve over the phone. Have pen and paper ready! Some companies will use on-line whiteboards which you will access from your home computer, and the interviewer will be able to see your code as you write it.

, Repeat it back to the interviewer to make sure you're solving the question that was asked. Ask questions to clarify the parameters of the problem; answer questions succinctly.

, Companies often schedule a half-day for a first interview, with the candidate meeting four or five engineers, and possibly the manager, with each meeting running 45-60 minutes.

,, Shine your shoes, brush your teeth, wash your hair, etc., and in general look ""properly assembled"". Women: no big, dangling earrings, low-cut dresses, or other cocktail-party clothes. In general, the image you present should be of understated competence. The real test, of course, is in the substance of the interview, but you don't want to prejudice the interviewer against you to start with.

, Better to get there 45 minutes ahead of time and listen to your car radio for 40 minutes, than to get there 15 minutes late. First impressions count!

, They may give you an overview of your interview schedule, and may even (if you're lucky) coach you a bit about what's to come. They will then hand you off to your first interviewer.

, Listen carefully to questions, answer succinctly, and don't jump the gun.

, Explain your reasoning as you go, and always make sure you're answering the question asked. Ask questions if you need to. If you get really stuck, ask for a hint.

, Try to strike a balance between generality and specificity.

, Again, make sure you understand the question correctly before proceeding, and, without rambling, let the interviewer know your thought process. Questions of this kind are often about understanding how you approach problems as much as they are about finding the right answer.

, They may be testing your honesty.

, Ask more questions if they may help you get to an answer, or otherwise explain how you would find information to answer the question.

, You'll probably need to wet your whistle from time to time.

,, Show interest in the product by asking intelligent questions about it.

,, Ofttimes you may touch base with the HR person again at the end of your interview day.

, If so, skip down. If not, you will, we hope, get a phone call that goes something like this: ""Hi, Sam. We really enjoyed talking with you the other day and would like to invite you back for a second interview. There are a couple more engineers who didn't get a chance to talk with you the first time we'd like you to meet the manager/director/vice president/president. When are you available to come in?""

, It is almost always less technical than the first, and is more a formality to make sure the manager has the necessary approvals to extend an offer. Often, people's schedules dictate who will be there and who won't, and you might need to come back a third time to meet the company president.

,, Don't give a lower end that's lower than what you're willing to accept.

, But in general, defer questions about salary until it's clear that the company is seriously interested in you.

,,, Don't reveal the name of the other company or the details of the offer; just the fact of its existence will strengthen your position. You can talk about it in general, and how you'd weigh the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the offers, but it's a tricky negotiation.

,), it'll usually be within a week or so after your final interview. A formal offer letter will be sent by snail mail. It will have an expiration date a few days in the future. If you're sure, call the manager to accept. If not, reply with a counter-offer, but be sure it's one that's within the realm of possibility.

Graph the stress-strain curve (optional).",How to Measure Tensile Strength Using a Tensile Testing Machine," For example: you may use a strand of hair, yarn, medical sutures, sewing thread, etc.;
, Ensure that you do not clamp the calipers too hard around the sample in order to ensure you are taking an accurate measurement.

, Use the formula A=Ï*r^2. You will have to divide the measured diameter in half in order to find the radius. Make sure that you are using the correct units; you will have to convert the original measurement from millimeters to meters., When secured at the bottom, clamp the other end of the material to the top of the base. Make sure that your sample is taut, but not stretched.

, The measured section should be from the point of contact at the bottom of the base to the point of contact at the top.

, This is the number of millimeters per minute that the machine will move, separating the top and bottom pieces of the base in order to stretch your sample. On the test stand, press the leftmost button for ""menu,"" and scroll through the options using the designated buttons. On the strain rate slide, press the middle two buttons to increase or decrease the strain rate as desired. Press the rightmost button to enter the strain rate.

, At the bottom of the screen, check âinvert loadâ in order to correctly graph your travel vs. load curve.

, The machine will pull the sample at the designated strain rate., The software will continue recording, but you will disregard the data collected after the sample breaks.

, You will see a graph of load vs. travel. On the left-hand side, you will see a data table. From this data, you will find the maximum force the machine applied to your sample. Press the circle button on the tensile testing machine to end the trial., You will be asked where you would like to save the file. Save it to your desktop, a flash drive, or any designated place on your computer. The data will be saved in a .txt file.

, You may use software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Once the data from the .txt file has been copied into the document, add in the cross-sectional area and original length of the sample.

, This is done by ânormalizingâ the data, specifically by zeroing the travel from the start time. This is completed by using a code to subtract the adjacent cell by the initial reading value of the travel. This code utilizes the â$â sign to ensure the initial reading value is fixed, and then the code is copied to all cells in the column corresponding with the remaining data data.

, This is done by creating a code to divide the change in length data by the original length. The â$â is again used to fix the original length value, and the code is copied for all corresponding cells in the column. As strain is unitless, the original values were kept in millimeters.

, This code also utilizes the â$â symbol to ensure that the value of the cell remains the same when copying the code into the rest of the column. As the number outputted was quite large, it was converted into megapascals by dividing by 10^6. Note that the units for load are Newtons and the units for cross-sectional area are in square meters.

, This can be achieved using the graphing features of excel.

Discover the different features and applications and how they may be beneficial to you as an engineering student. The best way to do this is simply by navigating through your device and familiarizing yourself with foreign applications. It is easiest to first familiarize yourself with useful applications that you are already somewhat familiar with.
, Technology is everywhere. It is easy to drown in new information and would be nearly impossible to learn about every new software application or device. As an engineering student, you will be working with a great deal of technologies, but you should not waste your time learning about technologies that are not related to your specific field of study., Ask yourself the following questions to ensure that you are focusing on applicable technologies:

Is this technology something my college would require us to use?
Does my engineering discipline deal with these types of technologies?
Will this technology be beneficial in the advancement of my academic or professional career?
Are there any similar technologies that I already know of?
Is this a type of technology that is slowly dying out, or is it constantly being advanced/changed?
Have I asked other peers or professionals whether or not this technology will be useful to me?

, Recent innovations are mainly introduced in the consumer space, and odds are, these new innovations will be a part of your future. One must not ignore the consumer space and only focus on fully developed technologies, as every advancement in technology started out in the consumer space., Social media has become a mainstream marketing channel.

, If you have not tried this before, review the basics of soldering electronics. You'll need to solder two connections:


Solder a red wire to the positive pin of the solar cell
Solder a black wire to the ground pin of the solar cell

, Now it's time to add the capacitor, so it can store a charge from the solar cell:

Connect the positive pin of the capacitor to the positive wire of solar cell.
Connect the negative pin of the capacitor to the negative wire of the solar cell.

, Attach the motor to the solar cell so it can draw power:


Connect the positive wire of the motor to the positive pin of the solar cell.
Connect the negative wire of the motor to the negative pin of the solar cell.

, The motor will start spinning once light hits the solar panel.

, Photons from the light source hit the electrons in the solar cell, causing it to produce power (a continual supply of energy). The capacitor stores up enough energy to get the motor started, and smooths the output of the solar cell. The motor is a solenoid (a coil of wire) around a metal core, surrounded by two magnets. The energy passing through the solenoid temporarily magnetizes the core, so that the magnets cause it to spin."

You must now add text onto this surface in a 2D format first. Under the sketch tab, click on the Text icon box that has the capital ""A"" next to it to begin the text command.

, Once the text command has been started, you must now selected where on the part face your text will go and how big of an area you would like your text to cover. On the part face, left click and drag a box to the size of text area you would like to cover.

, Once the text box size and location has been determined, next you must format the text that will be implemented into the sketch. Many customizations can be made as far as fonts and sizes. Before typing in your text, choose the font of your choice and the size you would like to extrude. In the lower part of the Format Text box, type in the text of your choice that you would like to extrude and click ""Ok"" in the bottom right of the format text box.

, Once you have your text shown and positioned how you would like it to be extruded, click on the ""Finish Sketch"" icon to complete your 2D Sketch and return back to the 3D view of your part model.

, There are many commands in Autodesk Inventor that will perform an extrusion. The most user friendly way to use with text is the emboss command which is a form of an extrusion. To begin this command, click on the ""Emboss"" icon in the toolbar, above the ""Create"" drop-box.

, Once the emboss command is selected, you will be prompted with the emboss command box. You must now select the 2D sketch you created containing the text of your choice. Hover over the text with your cursor and once it is highlighted, left click to select.

, When you text is selected correctly, your sketch will turn blue to indicate it is chosen. Next, you must specify with you would like to extrude the text vertically above your part surface or extrude vertically into your part surface. Extruding above your part surface can be selected by choosing the blue highlighted icon in the upper right hand side of the command box. Extruding into your part surface can be chosen by the middle icon indicating removing of material. Once you have determined your option, click on ""Ok"" to extrude the 2D sketch.

, You have now successfully Extruded Text using Autodesk Inventor.

Graduate from an approved engineering program.,
Earn ""engineer intern"" or ""engineer-in-training"" certification.,
Work as an engineer.,
Review your state's licensure requirements.,
Complete your application.,
Provide professional references.,
Have your education verified.,
Take and pass the required examinations.,
Take continuing education courses.,
Pay required licensing fees and taxes.,
Renew your license in a timely fashion.",How to Get a Construction Engineering License," Each state has its own requirements of the education that will suffice to make you eligible for a construction or civil engineering license. Generally you should get a four-year degree in engineering through a college or university with an engineering program accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Committee (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).When you're choosing schools, look for one that includes the phrase ""EAC/ABET accredited"" in conjunction with their engineering programs.
You don't necessarily have to go to school in the state where you want to work after you graduate. However, you should look at the educational requirements of the state where you want to work, not the state where your school is located, since they may differ.
If you haven't decided where you want to work yet and are looking at several different states as possibilities, look up the licensing requirements for each and make sure your program would suffice in any of them.
Each state's engineering licensing board has a website that spells out the educational and work requirements for license applicants. You also may be able to find additional resources on the state's website, or look over the application materials to prepare.
Some states also have combination programs that allow you to get some of your credits from a community college, which can save you money. However, make sure you're taking the required courses and have sufficient hours in the disciplines listed by the licensing board.;
, If you pass the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam just before or soon after you graduate from college, you can become classified as an ""engineer intern."" Also called an ""engineer-in-training"" in some areas, this classification demonstrates to employers that you've mastered the fundamentals of engineering and are on your way to licensure.The FE exam is administered over the course of one day, and you will have to answer 110 multiple choice questions.
The basic fee for the FE exam is $225. Some states may charge additional application or processing fees.

, You must have at least four years of work experience as an engineer before you're eligible for licensure. Typically you'll need to work for and be supervised by a licensed professional engineer, who will provide you with a professional reference when you apply for your license.Focus on gaining substantive experience in design or analysis, as these are the types of experience most commonly accepted by licensing boards.
As you work, your responsibilities and your supervisor's expectations of your output should progress and increase over time.
When you apply for your license, you will have to demonstrate the progress that you made through your work and on-the-job training, so it's a good idea to take notes of the projects you undertake along with a brief description of what you did.
Keeping these notes on a regular basis, typically daily or weekly, is helpful since with the passage of time you can forget projects that would be important to include on your license application.

, Since each state has specific license requirements, it's important to check them on a regular basis and make sure you're fulfilling them appropriately.This is especially important if you're starting your process in one state but plan to move to another. While states do have reciprocity with other states for education and work done, you must keep in mind that you need to fulfill the requirements of the state where you intend to work, not the state where you are.
Getting a professional engineering license requires a significant investment of your time and money â two things you don't want to waste doing something that isn't necessary for licensure.
Find the website of the state licensing board and bookmark it in your browser so you can refer to it regularly.
If the state licensing board provides a checklist of licensure requirements, you may want to print that out and post it in a place where you'll see it on a daily basis, such as on the refrigerator or in the bathroom.

, When you're nearing time to start the licensure process, get a copy of the application so you can look it over and gather the information and materials you'll need to complete it.The licensing application requires you to provide basic identification information such as your name, address, and birth date, along with details about your engineering education and experience.
You also must answer basic questions about your application history, including whether you've ever been convicted of a felony and whether you've ever been refused a license or had a license suspended in another state.
The application also includes space for you to describe your work experience, along with forms you must send to each of your supervisors to verify the experience you described in your application.
Your application must be accompanied by a licensing fee of at least $230. Check with your licensing board to confirm the acceptable methods of payment.

, Each state has its own requirements regarding the references you must provide. Typically at least some, if not all, of these references must be people who are currently licensed professional engineers.Your professional references typically are separate from the forms completed by your supervisors to verify your work experience. However, you may be able to use the same people to both verify your work experience and provide a professional reference.
Professional references typically testify both to your skills as an engineer and to your general character.

, Along with your application, you must get your school to send transcripts verifying that you have the degrees you listed on your application. The state licensing board provides a transcript request form that you must send to your school, which will send your transcript directly to the licensing board.You must provide the name and address of the educational institution you attended on your application, then send the transcript request form to the appropriate office at your school.
Although transcript fees vary significantly among schools, you should expect to pay a fee for copies of your transcript. This fee will be less than a hundred dollars, typically around $30 or $40.
If you've taken the FE exam, you also must have that exam and your score verified by the organization that administered your exam.

, All professional engineers must take and pass the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam, administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).The fee for the PE is $230, and typically you'll pay it when you submit your license application to your state's licensing board. Your state may have other fees related to the application in addition to the testing fee.
Your state also may require you to take and pass an ethics exam. This exam typically covers your state's licensure law and the rules of the state licensing board.

, All states require licensed engineers to complete continuing education courses so they are up to date on the latest technological trends and industry standards.The number of hours of courses you must take varies among states. You can find the requirements on the website of your state licensing board.
State licensing boards also may require that a specified portion of your continuing education hours consist of ethics courses.
Expect to pay several hundred dollars to complete your continuing education requirement each year. If you pay for these courses out of pocket, you can deduct the amount as a business expense on your taxes. Save your receipts and basic information about the courses.

, To keep your license from being suspended, you must pay any licensing fees, dues, or privilege taxes that your state requires licensed engineers to pay each year.Some states, such as Tennessee, require all residents who hold a professional license in the state to pay privilege taxes to the state department of revenue each year. These taxes typically are several hundred dollars.
Your state licensing board may charge fees every year, or may charge a single lump-sum fee when your license is issued and when it is renewed. Expect your licensing fees also to be several hundred dollars.
If you work for an engineering firm, the firm may pay your licensing fees and taxes as well as any dues owed for memberships in professional organizations. However, these payments are your responsibility, so it's up to you to make sure they're paid on time.
Keep in mind that if you pay your licensing fees yourself, the amount is deductible as a business expense on your taxes. The same goes for any dues you pay for membership in a professional organization.

, Each state has different requirements for when your license must be renewed, so be sure to check with your state's licensing board so you know and understand these requirements.Typically you have to renew your license every three to five years at a minimum, although some states may require you to renew your license more often.
Renewal involves filling out an application and paying renewal fees. You typically must demonstrate that your existing license is in good standing and that you've fulfilled all continuing education and other requirements.

Understand some basics before you begin.,
Start with the Includes.,
Set up your main() function.,
Set up your variables.,
Initialize SDL.,
Load your image.,
Initialize your surface.,
Create your event loop.,
Collect your garbage.,
Compile, run, and debug (if needed).",How to Display an Image Using SDL," It's best you know:


Basic Programming Knowledge and C++ knowledge: This tutorial assumes you already have basic programming knowledge and are familiar with C++; although you can, in theory, follow the guide and be successful -- going any further into programming with graphics, controls, etc. will be quite difficult if you don't have a firm grasp on basic programming concepts.
How To Set Up and Use Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment): This tutorial assumes you have already set up your IDE to work with the SDL and SDL_image libraries. In addition, you should already know how to compile, debug, and execute programs from within your IDE.


Warning: All IDE's are different and need to be linked to libraries and include files differently. If you have never worked with external libraries and include files before try reading through the documentation of your preferred IDE for information on how to accomplish this.

;
, In order to use SDL you will only be including two files at the beginning of your .cpp file: SDL.h and SDL_image.h.


Your includes should be before your main() function and should look like the following:


Tip: If SDL functions are not defined in your compiler after including SDL.h and SDL_image.h make sure you have told your compiler where to look for them!



, If you are not used to passing arguments through your main function then the style of the main when using SDL may be new to you. For simplicity's sake this wikiHow will not use these arguments, but they still need to be there to compile correctly.


The opening of your main() function should look like the following:


Tip: Typically int argc would be the number of strings being passed, and char **argv would be the strings being passed to your main via command line.



, This project will only be using two primitive data types and two SDL specific data types; we will use one char* that will be set to the path of the image you would like to display (we could also use a string for the image path, but the char* makes this a little more straight forward), one bool which will be used as a sentinel in out event loop later on, one SDL_Event variable for our event loop, and two SDL_Surface variables -- one for our screen, and one for our image.


Your variables should be placed within your main() function, and should look like the following:


Tip: Make sure imagePath is the exact path to your image in relation to where your .cpp is located.



, In order to use SDL we must first initialize it. Although it is not necessary to compile, it is standard practice to attempt to initialize SDL and upon failure throw an error and return a value to end the main function. This makes debugging a lot easier and is good programming practice.


This is how SDL should be initialized within your main() function:


Tip: Writing your error message to a file may be more advantageous in the future as your projects grow in size.



, In order to display an image we first have to load the image into memory. This is done is SDL using the IMG_Load function. Much like when we initialized SDL we want to attempt to load our image, but upon failure we want to throw an error and return a value to the main function. This time we also want to quit SDL using the SDL_Quit() function since we have previously initialized SDL.


Place the following code within your main() function to load your image into memory:


Tip: If this results in a failure it is likely your imagePath is incorrect.



, To set up the screen surface is a little more complicated because there are many options for setting up your screen; you can set this up as full screen, hardware rendered, software rendered, etc. But for this tutorial we will use a simple setup by using the width and height of our previously loaded image and pass the SDL_ANYFORMAT flag to let SDL do the work for us.


Much like the previous steps we want to handle a failure by calling SDL_Quit() and returning a value to main, but this time we want to add an extra argument. Since we allocated memory when we set up the image, if the program fails at this point we have to call SDL_FreeSurface to free the memory allocated to image in order to avoid a memory leak.
Place the following code within your main() function to initializing the SDL surface:

, An event loop is not necessary for displaying an image, but it allows us to keep the image on the screen until we want it to close. In the example here the image will stay on the screen until we press a key on the keyboard.


In order to display the image we will first use SDL_BlitSurface to stick the two surfaces and SDL_Flip to display the image.
This is also where our sentinel value comes into play; we will continue in our loop until the SDL_Quit event is caught (the user closes the window). Once the user closes the window we set the sentinel to false which will meet the condition for the loop to exit.
The following code for the event loop should be placed within your main() function:

, At this point we have displayed our image and all is well. But if we were to just stop here we would create a memory leak because the memory we allocated for our image was never freed. So we must remember to end our program by freeing the surface and for good measure quit SDL using the SDL_Quit function.


Place the following code at the end of your main() function

, Now that we are done with the fun part it's time to see if your code will actually compile and run.


There is a chance that you will get build errors; this is likely due to a typo somewhere in the code. If you get a build error double check the code to make sure you didn't miss anything.
To recap, your entire file should look like this:

Write a Problem Statement: This step is essential.,
Select Input Variables and Entities: Use the problem statement to create entities and variables for the simulation.,
Make Constraints on Decision Variables: Begin to form your constraints1 on the decision variables.,
Determine Output Variables: Establish what variables you want the simulation to output.,
Collect Data from Real-Life System: Gather information from the system to input into the simulation.,
Model Development: Develop a logical diagram/flowchart to visually see the progression of the simulation.,
Select Simulation Software: Choose simulation software to run your model.,
Model Verification: Run the simulation and compare the results to the actual system.,
Model Experimentation & Optimization: Test the simulation to find the best possible solution to the problem.,
Implementation of Simulation Results: Apply the results to the real-world system after determining the best solution based on the data input.",How to Conduct a Simulation Analysis," For simulation to be effective, it needs to solve the right problem. Take a look at the system and its flaws to formulate the problem statement.;
, Entities are the bodies the simulation tracks. For the supermarket model, the entities could be people. There are two types of variables. Decision Variables are variables that can be controlled by the programmer. Uncontrollable Variables are variables that are random and can be approximated, but not controlled by the programmer.

, To customize the simulation to the real world system, assign values and constraints to the variables that can be controlled.

, During this step, consider your problem statement. What are you trying to solve? Try to program output variables that are broad enough to help see the problem. For example, if your only output variable were customer wait time, you would be unable to see the cashier and bagger idle time. You cannot fix a bike with only a flashlight in a dark room. To fully see the problem, you need light from every direction. Only then can you see the problem.

, This can be done using a combination of stopwatches, video surveillance, computer print-outs, and manual data collection (ie: individual tallies when customer leaves within specific time interval)

, This will help you see and better model the system. There are two approaches for developing your flowchart, and eventually your simulation. The model approach you choose will inevitably dictate the outputs.

, You may need to assign different capabilities, such as a random number generation, which would help model the randomness of reality in the simulation. The software you choose affects your simulation, so select the best type for your needs.

, Confirm if the data found is comparable to real data. Additionally, make sure the model is consistent with your initial logic. Did you build the model correctly? Rework your simulation until it resembles the real world data.

, Try altering some of the variables. Graph all findings to see all possible solutions, as there may be more than one solution to the problem. You as the programmer decide the best possible option based on your knowledge of the system. For example, if the simulation output suggests that one solution is having 30 cashiers working per shift, you as a programmer know that is not economically possible for the store. You must find a better solution.

, Be prepared to see changes in the system function.

Take the classes that will prepare you.,
Do extracurricular activities that help you prepare as well.,
Donât worry about getting into the best college.,
Start to think about what kinds of Engineering you would like.,
Be careful of your first year of college in particular.,
Figure out a study schedule that works for you.,
Decide your major.,
Once you are ""over the hump"" of the first year or two, your life will be good.,
Learn about engineering in your current job.,
Decide if you want to go back to school.",How to Become an Engineer," It will help you get into engineering school, and make school easier.


Take math and science classes, as many as you can.
If possible, take an AP class or two. Many would suggest AP Calculus, but not every high school offers them.;
,


Look into a summer engineering program. Many of them are fun, and can get you learning faster.
Have a fun engineering related hobby. You can have fun, make good money, and get down the road of engineering at the same time. You could fix computers, build speakers, build websites.
Find a mentor who is an engineer.

, Engineers get paid well no matter what school they are from.


Sure, Stanford and MIT engineers can get paid $150k at age 23, but really, engineers from any legit college do great.

, You don't need to decide, but it is good to think about it.


Petroleum engineering pays more, but know that most jobs are outside big cities.
Aerospace engineering is really cool (building fighter planes), but can be a bad job market if the defense budget is being cut.
For the short term, maybe the long term, software and computer engineering will have tons of jobs.

, Donât overload yourself, since it can be overwhelming. Stick it out, buckle down, and donât give up!


Even if you pass the AP exam, you may want to retake the class first semester of college and not skip ahead unless you are very confident. Retaking these classes will also boost your GPA.
Know that some schools have engineering âweederâ classes. The professors try to get aspiring engineers to give up. Why they do this, we donât know, and no, it isnât nice. But realize, once you get past that one or two classes, it is all downhill and easy from there. In fact, most schools will give senior engineering students all As.
Go to class, and to office hours. You don't need to but, do it unless you know you don't need to.
Get a study buddy, and a smart one.
Find someone to help you get through the hard classes. You may just have an awesome and smart study buddy, but find a resource for when you need more help. Best case is a junior or senior at your school. If you can afford to pay someone, that would work as well. Or you could try some of the new online tutoring websites.

, Until you get into a groove, do what you can to get ahead of things. Do extra problems.


Some people do best at doing a bit of work each day, others prefer to do all nighters.
University is different than high school and you'll best tested on your ability to apply what you've learned to problems you haven't seen in the assignment. Be sure to study old exams.
Make sure you know which classes will be important in the next year of your curriculum, and make sure you spend extra time on them.
Know your strengths and weaknesses. Understand what kinds of classes come easy to you, and which do not. Make sure you mix up your schedule so you have a balance.

, Engineering has so many varieties, but your school may have a specialty.


Think about the different kinds of engineering, such as mechanical engineering, software engineering, biomedical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and more. Note, in most schools, computer science is now in the engineering school as well. Many will call it computer engineering.
If you are a pure quantitative person, you would want to be in the engineering school, and not have to deal with the pesky liberal arts classes. However, if you really like the variety, consider a double major with something very different.
Remember that if you major in engineering, you can always decide not to work in Engineering. But if you donât major in engineering, you wonât be able to work in engineering.
If you are thinking about business school some day, remember that engineering school is a great background for an MBA.

,


You can look at getting a mentor who works at a company to help explore career options.
Majoring in engineering gives you the freedom to work for a big company, a small company, or even to be your own boss as a consultant. A mentor, professor, or a recent grad can help you figure out what you might want to try.
Often professors will have jobs for juniors or seniors. Jobs can be in research, or in helping new students.

, For example, if you are interested in electrical engineering, get a job in a factory working with engineers. If you are interested in software engineering, apply for a QA job with a software company.

, You can think about if you want to go to school full time, or part time.


See if your current employer will pay for engineering school. It is fairly common. If it there is no formal program, just ask! Many companies would be happy to invest in the education of an engineer. It saves them money over hiring someone new.
A good compromise is to take night school classes for the first semester or two, to see if you like it.
If you are interested in software engineering, you can simply learn to code on sites like W3Schools. Or, you can sign up for Odesk and do some jobs. You wonât make much money on Odesk, since you are competing with people overseas, but it is a great way to learn. Many silicon valley firms are desperate for engineers, and wonât ask for a degree anyway.

Decide on the desired flow rate.,
Measure the height the water needs to travel.,
Estimate friction losses from the pipe.,
Add the pumping lift and friction loss together.,
Look up the specific gravity if you are pumping anything besides water.,
Enter these values into the water horsepower formula.,
Divide horsepower by pump efficiency.",How to Calculate Water Pump Horsepower1," The needs of your project determine the necessary flow rate of liquid from the pump. Write this value down in gallons per minute (gpm). You won't be using this value right away, but it will determine which pumps and pipes you consider.
Example: A gardener has an irrigation plan that requires a flow rate of 10 gallons per minute.;
, This is the vertical distance from the top of the water table (or the top of the water level in the first tank) to the final destination of the water. Ignore any horizontal distance. If the water level changes over time, use the maximum expected distance. This is the ""pumping lift"" your pump will need to generate.Example: When the gardener's water tank is nearly empty (the lowest expected level), its water level is 50 feet below the area of the garden that needs watering.

, Besides the minimum pressure needed to move water a certain distance, your pump also needs to overcome the force of friction as the water moves through the pipe. The amount of friction depends on the pipe's material, internal diameter, and length, as well as the type of bends and fittings you use. Look up these values on a pipe friction loss chart such as this one. Write down the total friction loss in feet of head (meaning the number of feet you ""lose"" from your pumping lift because of friction).
Example: The gardener decides to use 1"" diameter plastic pipes, and needs 75 ft of pipe total (including horizontal lengths). A pipe friction loss chart tells him that 1"" plastic pipes cause a loss of 6.3 ft of head for every 100 ft of pipe length.75ftâ6.3fthead100ft=4.7fthead{\displaystyle 75ft*{\frac {6.3ft_{head}}{100ft}}=4.7ft_{head}}He also looks up the friction loss from each fitting in the pipe. For 1"" plastic, one 90Âº elbow connector and three threaded fittings contribute a total loss of 15 ft.Adding this all together, the total friction loss is 4.7 + 15 = 19.7 ft., or about 20 ft.


These charts often include an estimate of water velocity as well, based on flow rate and the pipes you use. It's best to keep velocity below 5 ft / s to prevent ""water hammer,"" the repeated knocking vibration that can damage your equipment., The vertical distance water needs to travel plus the friction losses from the pipe make the ""total dynamic head"" or TDH. This is the total pressure load the pump needs to overcome.Example: TDH = vertical distance + friction loss = 50 ft + 20 ft = 70 ft.


, The basic water horsepower formula assumes you are pumping water. If you are pumping a different fluid, look up its ""specific gravity"" online or in an engineering reference book. Fluids with a higher specific density are denser, and require more horsepower to push through the pipe.
Example: Since the gardener is pumping water, he doesn't need to look anything up. Water's specific gravity is equal to 1.

, The water horsepower, or minimum power required to run the pump, equals TDHâQâSG3960{\displaystyle {\frac {TDH*Q*SG}{3960}}}, where TDH is the total dynamic head in feet, Q is the flow rate in gpm, and SG is the specific gravity (1 for water). Enter all the values you found into this formula to find the water horsepower for your project.
Example: The garden pump needs to overcome a TDH of 70 ft and produce a flow rate Q of 10 gpm. Since it is pumping water, the SG is equal to 1.Water horsepower = TDHâQâSG3960=70â10â13960={\displaystyle {\frac {TDH*Q*SG}{3960}}={\frac {70*10*1}{3960}}=} ~0.18 horsepower.

, Now you know how much horsepower you need to supply to run your pump. However, no mechanical device is 100% efficient at transferring power. Once you have chosen a pump, check the manufacturer's info for the pump's efficiency and write it as a decimal. Divide the water horsepower by this value to find the actual horsepower of the motor you need for your pump.Example: To do 0.18 horsepower of work, a pump with a 50% (or 0.5) efficiency rating would actually require 0.180.5={\displaystyle {\frac {0.18}{0.5}}=} a 0.36 hp motor.


Most modern pumps are between 50% and 85% efficient when used as intended.If you cannot find an efficiency rating for your pump, you can assume the actual motor horsepower needed falls between WaterHP0.5{\displaystyle {\frac {WaterHP}{0.5}}} and WaterHP0.85{\displaystyle {\frac {WaterHP}{0.85}}}

Look up the specific gravity of the fluid.,
Estimate horsepower from these values.",How to Calculate Water Pump Horsepower2," This is the tank that supplies water for your pump. The water level in the tank will also equal the water level in the pipe, so this is the level the pump is currently drawing from.

If you are pumping from a well, either measure the depth directly or look for an estimate of water table levels in your area (at this time of year). Government agencies such as the USGS can often provide this information., The destination reservoir is a second tank, to which the pump transfers water from the base reservoir. Make sure it is empty and connected properly to the pump.

If you do not normally have a tank here, just put down a large bucket to collect the water for this measurement. Use a bucket of known size in gallons.


, Using a scale or ruler, measure the vertical distance between the water level in the base reservoir tank and the water input at the destination tank. Write down the distance in feet.

For example, say the water level in the first tank is 120 feet lower in elevation than the destination reservoir.

For this step, it doesn't matter how much horizontal distance the water travels.


, Turn on the device, and it will start pumping water. Start a stop watch at the same time.
, Once your pump is working, you can measure the volumetric flow rate: the volume of water transported per unit of time. Note this rate in gallons per minute.

For example, your pump takes 30 seconds to fill a 10 gallon container. This means the flow rate is 10Â gallons30Â secondsâ60secondsminute=20gallonsminute{\displaystyle {\frac {10\ gallons}{30\ seconds}}*60{\frac {seconds}{minute}}=20{\frac {gallons}{minute}}}. This is usually written 20 gpm, for ""gallons per minute"".


, Specific gravity is a measurement of density: the more dense a fluid is, the more power it takes to pump. Water has a specific gravity of 1. If pumping a different fluid, look it up on a specific gravity engineering table.

This example will use water, so the specific gravity is 1.


, The water horsepower of the pump is roughly equal to HâQâSG3960{\displaystyle {\frac {H*Q*SG}{3960}}}, where H is the vertical distance the water travels in feet, Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, and SG is the specific gravity of the fluid.

In this example, the pump is operating at 120ftâ20gpmâ13960={\displaystyle {\frac {120ft*20gpm*1}{3960}}=} 0.65 horsepower.

In reality, you are likely using more power than this on your pump. Your pump is also overcoming the force of friction in the pipes, and some power is wasted due to the inefficiency of the motor. You can double this result for a rough estimate of power consumption, or track the actual amount of fuel or electricity your motor uses, or refer to the full calculations above.

Don't give up!",How to Find an Engineering Internship," Having a well formatted and relevant resume is an essential first step when it comes toÂ applying for any internship. If this is a new idea to you there are many free online resources that provide tips in resume writing. If you are a student attending a university, there are most likely free resume writing workshops where professionals can help you with the resume writing process. As an engineering student you may also want to think about tailoring your resume to your specific major. Some ways of doing this may include:


Creating an Objective Statement related to your short term goals in the field of engineering.
Listing courses you have taken related to math, science, and engineering.
Listing engineering related software you are familiar with.
Optional: List your engineering specific GPA.;
, With many different fields of engineering, it can be overwhelming when its time to make the decision on which one to pursue. In order to avoid the regret of making the wrong choice, it may be useful to do the following when deciding which path is for you.

Reach out to professionals in different fields. They will be able to provide you valuable information on what career options are available for certain fields, and how they went about pursuing them.
Ask to shadow a professional in a field you are interested in.
Take time to find out what interests you the most.

, It can be very valuable to have connections in the field you are interested in. Talk with family and friends to see if anyone that you know has a career you have interest in. If you discover someone you know is an engineer, express your interest in the field to them. Chances are they have connections in the field and can help you get in contact with future employers., Almost all Universities will have multiple job fairs throughout the year. This is an event where representatives from a large number of organizations come to meet with students, and prospective employees. This is a great opportunity to network and get your name out there. Recruiters find these fairs a perfect way to assess your talent, so give it your best shot. If you attend, be sure to have several hard copies of your resume on hand, and be dressed in business casual to formal attire., While an engineering degree is one of the more difficult degrees to pursue, it is very important to maintain relatively good grades. While this may seem obvious, it is very attractive to future employers if they see a high GPA for a student pursuing an engineering degree.

Almost all universities have programs dedicated to making sure their students excel. If you find your grades slipping, it may be helpful to take advantage of some the resources your school provides to you.

, Experience can be viewed as much more than just previous jobs. While it is important to demonstrate previous work experience on your resume, experience can also come in many different forms. If you find that you don't have much engineering related experience or work experience in general early in your career, it may be useful to pursue the following.

Join a engineering related club at your school.
Find a part time job on campus.
Volunteer with local organizations.
Start or get involved with a project.

, There are many websites out there were employers can post job openings available at their company. Most of these websites allow you to narrow down your search to specifically what you're looking for, and apply to a certain job directly. You will most likely need to enter some basic information about yourself, and attach a digital version of your resume when applying to a job online. Why this process can be tedious, it is a great tool to helping you find an internship., LinkedIn is one of the largest professional networking sites. It is very simple to create your own profile on the site. Once you have done this you will have access to network with professionals in your field of interest, and also browseÂ through job openings they may have not been available to you otherwise., A cover letter is a document that goes hand in hand with your resume. When applying for an internship online they will most likely give you the option to attach a cover letter. A cover letter allows you to further expand or highlight certain areas of your resume. It is also a good idea to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for. For example, if the job description lists certain requirements it expects from their future employees, focus on how you meet those requirements., If an employer is interested in hiring you, there is a good chance you will be in contact with them via email. Proper email etiquette is a great skill to develop. It is not only important in order to demonstrate professionalism in the hiring process, but is also important in everyday communication once you secure the internship., Now that you have gotten noticed, you should have been asked to come in for an interview by now. If you are unfamiliar with this idea, your university again will most likely have many resources you can take advantage of to learn about the art of interviewing, as well as practice your craft.

A lot of the time the employer may choose to conduct a phone interview rather than an in person interview at first. This will take some of the pressure away from the interviewee. The interview is the final step to landing the internship. Make sure you show up early and look presentable. It is also a good idea to have a copy of your resume on hand!

, It is very common to become discouraged in the process of finding an internship or a job. A lotÂ of the time after applying for a job you won't hear back from them. Do not take this as a personal insult, it is simply impossible for them to get back to everyone with increasing amount of applicants. Stay persistent in your search and you will find the internship your looking for!"

Create the frame of the roof.,
Cover the roof.,
Create a window.,
Sit back and take pride in the Anglo Saxon style house you've built.

",How to Build an Anglo Saxon House," Learn about the styles of their homes., Start by leveling the land.

, First dig a hole a depth of 20 centimeters this is the depth of the refined wooden planks. Then lay out an outline of a rectangle with your refined wooden planks that is 5 meters (length) by 10 meters (width) in the hole you made. The outline should be hollow and the planks should be the same depth as the hole you dug. Now set the planks upright and nail the corners. Fill the area inside the hollow rectangle with stones and cement. Let the cement set; it will take 28 days for the cement to cure.

, Lay down the planks horizontally to the rectangular foundation. The length of the boards will be the length of the floor which is 5 meters long. One by one, nail the planks into the outside perimeter of the foundation. For added floor strength, fasten the boards to the concrete. You can do this by nailing the boards in, or use a glue that bonds to wood and concrete.

, Four walls in total will be needed to create this home. One wall you will need to leave space for a door. The doors dimensions will be 2 meters by 1 meter. So this dimension has to be left empty on one wall. You can first outline a door cut in your frame.


First build a frame for the wall with the height being 5 meters and the length will be 10 meters. Add wall studs every 1/2 of a meter, which is a total of 40 studs for both frames.Add cross-sections to support the frame and the roof of the home.
Build a frame for the remaining two walls with the dimensions of 5 by 5. You will need a total 20 wall studs for both 5 by 5 wall. Add cross-sections to support the frame and the roof of the home.

, Once all four walls are in place, do a strength test. To start this test, place varying weights onto the top plank of the wall do this for every inch of the four walls. If you see any bending, use more cross sections to strengthen the structure. If the wall needs even more strength, use triangular cross sections or more wall studs.

, Use a flat piece of wood that can cover the whole area inside and outside on all four walls. You will need 8 flat pieces of wood pieces in total one for each wall covering the inside and outside area. The measurements will be the same as the frame of the wall.


If you have a frame that is 5 by 5, the sheet of wood will be 5 by 5. Just nail the outside perimeter of the wood sheet to the frame and the wall studs.
If you have a frame that is 5 by 10, the wood cover will be 5 by 10. Then nail the outside perimeter of the wood sheet to the frame/studs.

, Cut a rectangle that is less than half the area of the wall in the center of the wall you have chosen. If you choose the wall with the longest length, then you can make a wider door cut, but the height is the same on any wall.


Once the door outline is cut, use thick planks and nail them on the perimeter of the rectangle. The door consists of planks and nails that can be either be in a cross pattern or a preferred pattern. Finally attach the door hinges to the door and the frame and grease the hinges. Add a door knob if you would like to, although Anglo Saxons did not use door knobs.

, The shape will be in the form of a triangular prism. This was the style of the Anglo Saxons and it helps prevent rain seeping into the home and ruining the floor. The width of the roof will be 5 meters and the length will be 10 meters, the height of the roof can be any size you would like to create.

, You need have the frame structurally sound before nailing it to the top planks; make sure you have all of the corners nailed and solid because you don't want the roof to fall while you are in the house. To make a more solid connection you can add wood adhesive in the corners. After you have the frame complete, you must add plank cross sections for support of the shingles or straw and also to keep out debris.

, This can be done with shingles or straw.


If you use shingles, you will have first to drill two holes in the top of each tile. Start from the top of the frame and work your way to the bottom of the both sides of the frame. Then you will have to place a peg into each tile, one by one in an overlapping pattern, until the roof is completely covered and has no holes that can cause water to leak into the home. The roof is complete!
If you choose the rolled straw, you will need rope to tie each bit of straw together. Starting from the top and working your way down, tie a piece of rope to each section of the wooden support beams. Make sure you have no holes where water can come in. The roof is complete!

, Saw out a rectangle one-fourth the area of one wall. Build a rectangular frame.The window frame should be 4/10 of a meter by 4/10. Since glass was not used in the Anglo Saxon community, you do not have to worry about covering the hole.

Opt for advanced classes if your school offers them.If you donât enjoy, or struggle to do well in high school courses in chemistry, biology, physics, algebra, trigonometry, and calculus, environmental engineering may not be the field for you.;
, Enroll in an environmental, civil, mechanical, chemical, or general engineering degree program. A bachelorâs degree in engineering is the minimum requirement for environmental engineers. Whenever possible, choose a program that is accredited by ABET (the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). This may be required for licensing in your state.Some colleges offer combined BS/MS programs, which typically take five years to complete. Obtaining a Masterâs degree is not normally required, but may improve your career prospects., Significant hands-on, real-world experience is expected before any new environmental engineer begins his or her career. Fortunately, environmental engineers have several options for gaining such experience while in school.Find environmental engineering internships during your summer breaks. If your school doesnât offer these internships, look at the Environmental Protection Agency, www.epa.gov/oha/careers/internships, or engineerjobs.com. Apply for an engineering co-op job your sophomore year in college. Many universities work with employers to offer students work experience as they complete an engineering degree. You must maintain a GPA of 2.7 or higher with many co-op programs. Get involved with a university research team. If you are unable to find an internship or co-op during a semester, apply to help with an environmental engineering research project. Experience in analyzing and testing data is highly valued in the workplace.
Apply for an entry-level environmental engineer position. You canât lead an engineering project in most states without a license. However, the experience gain assisting a licensed environmental engineer will help you to earn your license.

, Remember, without a BS degree in engineering from an accredited college or university (and also, preferably, one with ABET accreditation for its engineering program), you cannot become an environmental engineer.


You could still consider a related career, such as Environmental Scientist / Specialist (which requires a BS degree), or Environmental Engineering Technician (which requires an Associateâs degree)., In the U.S., the individual states control the licensing process of environmental engineers. Licensing is generally not required for entry-level positions in the field, but becoming a state-licensed Professional Engineer (PE) should be the goal of anyone seeking a career as an environmental engineer.Most states, however, follow a similar licensing process, which typically involves:

earning an engineering degree from an ABET-accredited institution;
passing the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam;
gaining substantial work or other relevant experience (typically for four years); and
passing the Professional Engineering (PE) exam.


Go to your stateâs Office of Professions (or similar) website to find out specific licensing information. You will likely return here to apply for a license after you have completed the requirements.

, The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam is conducted by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES), and is typically taken shortly after graduation. Check the NCEES website for exam times and locations.The FE Exam consists of 110 multiple-choice questions, is administered by computer, and currently costs $225 to take.

, After passing the FE Exam, you can call yourself an Engineer in Training (EIT) or Engineering Intern (EI).From there, most states require four years of real-world work experience before you can complete the process of securing a professional engineering license.Some states award credits towards this four-year requirement for a combination of education and experience. These credits differ from state to state, but may allow you to substitute graduate degrees for on-the-job experience. Check with the relevant state agency for information.

, Passing the Professional Engineering (PE) Exam is usually the final step before you can apply for state licensing as a Professional Engineer. It is not an easy step, however; the PE Exam is a rigorous, eight-hour test that is crafted for specialized fields such as environmental engineering.Like the FE Exam, the PE Exam is administered by the NCEES, and is offered in April and October each year. The current environmental engineering exam is an open-book test with one hundred multiple-choice questions, divided over two four-hour sessions. But again, donât take it lightly., By the time you obtain state licensure as an environmental engineer, you will already have several years of work experience under your belt. With licensure, however, your opportunities will likely grow substantially, and a new survey of your options may be in order.Consider moving to a state that employs many environmental engineers. For example, large numbers of environmental engineers find work in Massachusetts, while New Mexico and Alaskaâs engineers tend to get the highest average wages.
Inquire with the companies that you worked for during engineering co-op programs or internships. People inside the company can vouch for your work ethic and experience, and you may have an easier time landing a competitive job.
Apply for work with the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or a state or local agency with a similar focus. Renew your application regularly if you donât get a job when you first apply.
Look for jobs on specialized websites, for instance the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (aaees.org).

, The engineering field is always changing as new technologies, regulations, problems, and solutions emerge, so it is important to stay on top of things in order to advance your career. For instance, the explosive growth in natural gas drilling using hydraulic fracturing (or âfrackingâ) has created new challenges (and new job opportunities) for environmental engineers.Some states may require continuing education credits or some other form of evidence that you remain up-to-date with the profession in order to retain your license.
The AAEES website is a good starting point for recent publications and other information regarding environmental engineering (http://www.aaees.org/).

, After you become a professional engineer, you can apply to the National Society of Professional Engineers or the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists for board certification. A professional certification can help you network and improve your credentials as you look for senior engineering jobs.


AAEES certification, for instance, requires a combination of testing, work experience, proof of ongoing professional development, valid licensing, and âhigh ethical integrity.â Contact the organization for more specific information on the certification process."

Prop open the fractures.,

Collect the natural gas.,

Transfer the natural gas.",How to Better Understand Fracking,"Â A well is drilled vertically into the ground until it reaches the permeable shale layers.

Once the digging has hit the gas rich layers, redirect it horizontally into the rock layers. The digging is now parallel to the ground above, but at an immense depth below the surface (anywhere around 7,000 to 12,000 feet). The well is surrounded by a protective steel casing, and it is surrounded by both steel and concrete when it is drilled past the underground aquifer level.
Within the shale are small holes and fissures wherein the natural gases lie. These cracks are going to need to be expanded via pressure.;
,Â Feed high pressured water into the well via a pumping tank.

The high pressure and intensity of the water rushes into the shale layers, cracks, and crevices.
Floating throughout the water are high pressured sand particles or artificial proppants. Because of the high pressure of the water during hydraulic fracturing, the proppants are forced into the cracks and crevices of the shale rock.

,Â The internal pressure of the shale rock causes the water to make its way back to the surface.

Collect the used water in a designated tank, where it will later be transferred to a treatment plant.
As the water retreats, the cracks and crevices of the shale rock will attempt to close because it does not have the water pressure holding open the cracks anymore.

,Â Leave the proppants behind in the cracks and fractures after the water has retreated. As the name implies, the proppants âpropâ open the shale fractures, keeping them from closing off again.

Because of the immense pressure of the surrounding shale rock, fracturing proppants must be extremely strong and have a high crush factor.

,Â The once trapped shale gas is now able to flow free from the shale layers because it has remained propped open by high crush factor proppants.

The shale flows out from the fissures and into the well.

,Â From the well, the natural gas is transferred to nearby storage tanks until it is piped to market."

However, you may look more employable if you pursue your master's. After receiving your undergraduate degree, consider whether a master's program is right for you.


If you want specialized automotive engineering knowledge, a master's degree can help. If you felt particularly interested in a branch of study as an undergrad, consider pursuing that field further by going for your master's.Usually, you will take a variety of coursework and then complete a final project. A master's program can be a great place to make connections in the professional world. It can also increase your likelihood of employment and might secure you a higher paying job. Engineering companies are frequently looking for employees with specialized knowledge in dynamics, control, materials, and other fields of study., Every state is different in regards to becoming a certified automotive engineer. Spend time considering where you want to work and look into that state's requirements in terms of licensing and certification.

, In most states, you will have to work under the supervision of a licenses professional engineer for a number of years before you can enter an engineer-in-training program and take the Professional Engineer exam. As you reach your final year of college or graduate school, look for apprenticeship opportunities. Talk to professors, colleagues, and connections from past jobs and internships. The number of years you spend working under supervision varies based on state and your level of education., An Engineer-In-Training program is a one or two year program in which you work on the skills required to become a professional, licensed engineer. Find a good training program, one that fits your needs and career goals.


Training program vary by specialization, so look for a program catered to your professional goals. Program lengths vary from one to two years.The application process varies by program. You can take an Engineer-In-Training program online. The advantage to this is that such programs are cheaper and shorter and you'll be able to work while completing training. However, most employers value a lot of hands-on experience for the job. It might be better to find a program you can attend in person., The Professional Engineers exam tests your ability to perform competently in a specific engineering field. Once you pass the Professional Engineers exam, you will be a certified automotive engineer.


Spend a few months studying before taking the exam. You can take practice exams and prep courses online. You should also network with people in your training program. Work together to study and prepare in groups.
You sign up to take the exam online. Most states have testing centers, but you may have to travel some if there if there is not a center close to you.The PE exam is long. It lasts 8 hours and is split into a morning and afternoon session. Depending on your specialization, the exam will either be electronic or by pen and paper. You need to bring a form of ID to the testing center and cannot bring personal electronic devices, like cell phones, into the testing center.When you receive your score depends on the testing center as well as the type of exam.

, If you do not pass the exam initially, you may retake it. There may be a fee to retake the exam, depending on your specialization and testing site., The project you created in college or graduate school can be a powerful marketing tool. Submit the project to competitions. Send protocols to engineering companies. Create a personal website and include a section detailing your project.

Watch sound engineers work.,
Ask sound engineers if you can help in any way.,
Take any opportunity you can get.,
Intern at a recording and production company.",How to Become a Sound Engineer1," Go to a local bar or club that has live music, or the booth at a theater during a play, and watch what the sound person does. Pay attention to the set up of cords and sound boards. Watch how they interact with people. Take note of when they adjust levels and what the result is.Lots of churches have high quality sound systems and people who run them, so this is also a great place to go for an opportunity to watch.;
, The music industry involves a lot of making connections and getting your foot in the door. Once you find a sound engineer, ask if there is anything you can do, even if it just means taping cables down. You can start to build these connections, which may eventually lead to more involvement.Some people may tell you no. Maybe they donât want you in the way. You can be persistent and tell them youâll do anything and wonât bother them. Still, thereâs a time to give up and find someone else to ask.
If you are at a venue and you see people setting things up, ask if you can help. They will most likely welcome another set of hands.

, This is an industry that takes a while to work up the ranks into top professional jobs. If you have the opportunity to carry in sound equipment, do it. Maybe sometime you will get to help set everything up. Then you may get to run a sound check. Every chance you get to learn a little more is a building block for your career.Even though it can be hard, donât think you are too good for anything. Just swallow your pride and take the chance to help out and get some experience.
If you consistently show up at the same places and you are always willing to help in any way you are asked, people will start to notice and may trust you to do more important tasks.

, More than helping out at gigs, an internship will help you get more consistent experience. You may have to go unpaid for a while, but if you can afford to do this, you will learn enough to make up for the lack of pay. Find out if there is a studio near you and see what types of opportunities they have available.


Since there are so many different jobs that sound engineers can have, the range of internships may vary a lot. Any production company that has internships available is worth checking out, even if what they do is not exactly what you are interested in.

Learn about sound equipment.,
Master music software.,
Research safety protocols.,
Get experience in high school.,
Earn a degree.",How to Become a Sound Engineer2," Research speakers and see when to use different types. Find out which cords plug into mics and which ones go between soundboards and amps. You need to know how to set up all kinds of sound equipment. You can learn these things online through tutorial videos and also in person when you can work with sound people.Some sound equipment is the same as it was years ago, but many other technologies are continuing to evolve. Staying current on your knowledge is vital.

, You need to know how mix and edit in music software like Pro Tools and Cubase. If you can, purchase one of these programs and begin exploring what they can do and practice editing songs. Pick a song you like and import it into the software. Practice splitting the song into parts and changing pitches and volumes.


Not all sound engineers mix new music tracks, but being able to do it will make you more versatile.
It will take time to learn all of the things you can do, but itâs important to start building a foundation.

, Because sound engineers work with so many types of electrical equipment, you will need to learn some basic electrical safety. Learn about basic electricity, such as the difference between voltage and current. You will need to know how many pieces of equipment can be plugged into a specific power strip so you donât blow a fuse or ruin the equipment.


Taking classes in physics, for example, is a good place to start. If classes are not an option, consider an electrical safety training seminar.

, If you are still in school, you have access to some opportunities that others donât. Try to get involved with the theater program, which most likely uses a sound system during plays. Productions are often mostly run by students anyway, so this is an easy way to get hands on experience in a low key setting.In college, you also have some opportunities to get involved in running sound, even if you arenât studying it. Check in with your campus theater and see what they require for their sound people. Find out if you could start working with someone who already does it and learn from them.

, While you can learn on the job and get lots of experience, earning a degree shows your commitment to learning. It shows that you can work hard on something until it is complete. A degree also shows that you have been properly trained in the field. While it may not be mandatory for some jobs, itâs going to make you look better to those looking to hire quality engineers.A typical degree might be an Associateâs or Bachelorâs of Science in Audio Engineering. The degree might also be called Sound Engineering.
These degrees will tend to be a mix of music, business, and technical classes which serve to give you a well-rounded education in the field.

Hone your communication skills.,
Be flexible and committed to getting the job done.,
Develop humility and perseverance.,
Be easy to work with.",How to Become a Sound Engineer3," Being a sound engineer entails working with people of different personalities on a consistent basis, so you need to be an effective communicator. Learn to listen well to the responses you get from people. Answer questions as clearly as possible.Learn to understand what people mean even when they donât make much sense.
Get used to as much of the technical music lingo as possible. Things like âlead guitar,â âfeedback,â and ânormalize.â In music jargon, some words and phrases may have different meanings than you are used to.

, Sound engineers often have to work long, odd hours that may revolve around someone elseâs schedule. If you can only get into the studio starting at 9pm, then you need to be cool with that. If you have to redo equipment checks 5 times before a live show, donât get frustrated. Youâll likely work long hours on some projects to get them done within a certain time.Sound engineers often work nights and weekends, because these tend to be the times that live performance events happen. Although, in some cases you may find work in radio or TV, which might afford the chance for daytime work.
At least when you are first starting out, being as available as possible will be a strong asset you can offer someone looking to hire you.

, Sound engineers are often overlooked and are not likely to get a lot of praise for the work they do. If you are passionate about the work, it makes it easier to be okay with never being noticed. Donât give up when the job starts getting really tough and you donât want to keep going. Persevere through the hardship.Sound engineers rarely get the credit for an amazing concert or great mix on a hit song, so donât expect to gain fame through this career. You should find fulfillment through the work itself and not through any accolades you might receive.

, Youâll be working with lots of people, from artists in the studio, to venue owners, to tour managers. When they are demanding, do your best to go with the flow and do what they ask. Donât get angry easily and fight with people. Keeping a level head is important in this business.If you are likeable and easy to get along with, people will want to keep working with you. If you cause drama, you are likely to be replaced.
While you can actively work on this, in some ways it is more of a personality trait than an issue of effort. If you donât like people and have a hard time working with others, this may not be the profession for you.

Understand what a civil engineer does.,
Assess your skills.,
Choose a study program.,
Expect field trips to form a part of your degree.,
Start thinking about how to specialize as your degree studies move on.,
Get an internship.,
If you're in the United States, you'll need to undertake some specific examinations.,
Join the relevant professional organization that caters for civil engineers in your country.",How to Become a Civil Engineer," Basically, this is the side of engineering concerned with designing, building, and maintaining public works.Civil engineers focus on structures and facilities such as transportation routes, features (tunnels, bridges, flyovers), and hubs (such as airports and bus interchanges), water treatment (sewage, dams, pipelines, etc.) government buildings (police and fire stations, major office buildings, etc.), and other structures required on a large public scale. In some countries, such as the United States, civil engineering also involves military engineering.Another way of looking at what a civil engineer does is to see it as a role of reducing complex ideas initiated by policymakers, chief executives, and other such people into concrete reality.


It's a job that pays a reasonably high income due to the level of skills and expertise required, and the ongoing responsibilities to ensure safe, accurate, and enduring engineering outcomes.
Civil engineers can work in a variety of work environments, including in the public sector, as contractors, consultants, or even as part of a firm that undertakes work outsourced from municipalities and government. Civil engineers also work with architect firms and construction firms.Throughout the lifetime of a civil engineer career, you might vary your employment circumstances considerably to work around different needs and interests; the good thing is that your qualifications will allow you much flexibility.
Within civil engineering there are different roles open to you. For example, in the United Kingdom, you can become an engineering technician, an incorporated engineer, or a chartered engineer. Your personal interest in where to specialize will be something to consider as you pursue your studies and the different options offered through the course, so be sure to ask what's available in your country or region.;
, Civil engineering requires good mathematics, design, and science skills. In addition, having a ""big picture"" mentality, creativity, the ability to function as a member of a team, the ability to work without supervision and to handle high levels of responsibility, the ability to clearly and concisely communicate your ideas both verbally, and through the use of writing and images, are all important, well-rounded features to ensure a successful civil engineering career.


If you're still at school, appropriate subjects to focus on most include mathematics, design and technology, information technology, and physics, with economics, geography, and geology also being of help.
At school and during university, participate in engineering style competitions with teams, such as model bridge building competitions. These can increase your knowledge of how things work structurally and will give you a taste of how to work as a team.
Contact the universities offering civil engineering degrees that interest you to find out what their exact requirements are. The requirements are constantly updated to reflect new technologies and methodologies.
If you have already left school and haven't taken the appropriate subjects during school, you may need to undertake bridging courses or aptitude tests to prove that you're able to undertake the subjects offered in a civil engineering degree.

, In general, in most countries civil engineering requires a minimum of a bachelorâs degree, which will usually take about four years.Depending on where you study, you may also need to take a formal certification course at the end of the degree, and in some countries, being licensed (licensure) is a prerequisite to being allowed to work or as or call yourself a ""civil engineer"".Keep in mind that in order to become an engineer, there may be qualifications for your school. For example, in the United States, the bachelor program must be accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, or ABET.Choose a program that has courses in the specific areas you are interested in. These can include design, hydraulics, construction, earthquake engineering, soil mechanics, computer methods, construction management, structural mechanics, etc.
Consider whether you want to take some courses outside your own country, to expand your knowledge of what is happening in civil engineering elsewhere, such as in a country that has very different geological concerns from your own. You might need to have proficiency in another language to be able to do this. Find out what's possible by talking with your university course guidance.
Ensure that you take courses outside of your intended field. It is possible you will find a different field that you prefer, so try to choose broadly to get a good feel for the different areas open to you within civil engineering.

, Being given the opportunity to apply the theory to real-life examples will help you to grasp the principles faster and will probably increase your enthusiasm for your chosen career as well.

, From the start, find out all you can about the different types of civil engineering options open to you so that you're alert to what might end up being of most interest to you. Specializations might include coastal engineering, environmental issues, traffic and transportation, structural engineering, highway construction and maintenance, and so forth.

, While in school, if it at all possible, obtain an internship in the civil field that most interests you. Most engineering firms have some type of internship program. The experience you gain is invaluable not only to helping you establish and clarify your career goals, but also in gaining valuable experience for your resume which will make you a highly desirable entry level engineer. Construction experience (internship) in your field of interest may have as much, if not more, value for your future career as a civil engineer as good results in your degree.

, They are as follows:



During your study (preferably in your junior or senior year): Register for and take the FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam.This exam is an important step in your professional development. It tests on basic knowledge of engineering principles, and is required in order to obtain an EIT (engineer in training) license. Additionally, it is typically the first step to becoming a professional engineer.

When you have graduated: Find employment as an EIT, under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer. You will be required to account for an average of 4 years of employment as an EIT when you apply to take the PE (Principals and Practice of Engineering) exam.Sometimes graduate study may sometimes accepted in lieu of a year of employment.

While you are working: Ensure that you begin preparation for the PE exam.Regardless of what field of civil engineering you work in, becoming a PE (professional engineer) will provide you more opportunities and greatly increase your chances of advancement. After four years of employment as an EIT, you are qualified to apply for the PE.

Once you are a licensed PE: Keep track of the requirements to maintain your license. Depending on your license and your state, you may be required to complete Continuing Education Hours or Professional Development Hours.Similar external examination, external testing, or licensing is available in other countries. Ask your university or professional engineering association for details early on.

, Once you're working as a civil engineer, belonging to such an organization is the means for staying updated as to new developments, helps with your networking opportunities, and enables you to give back your knowledge to other engineers through seminars, etc., and through teaching in universities.In the United States, the relevant organization is the ASCE, or the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Do mock drawings for different companies.,
Make connections during your internship.,
Join a professional automotive design organization.,
Network at automotive design trade shows and conferences.,
Look for positions at large multinational corporations.,
Consider applying for a position at a start-up company.,
Be prepared to move for work.",How to Become a Car Designer," Before you get your formal education in automotive design, you should start with a genuine interest and passion in cars. If possible, spend time in an automotive shop or work first hand on a car to see how cars are built and how they function on a mechanical level.


You should also develop knowledge of the latest trends in automotive design and be interested in learning more about innovations in automotive design.
Strong drawing and sculpting skills are also key to being a successful car designer. Most employers are looking for people who possess creative skills and mechanical knowledge of cars, as they will be well rounded designers.;
, A bachelorâs degree is typically the minimum educational requirements for applying for car designer positions. Technical schools that have close relationships to automobile companies and traditional universities with automotive design programs that are well respected in the industry are both good options.Though a degree in an automotive design or automotive engineering program is ideal, you may also qualify to be a car designer if you have a bachelor's degree in industrial design or industrial engineering.Often, employers will recruit graduates from automotive design programs to work at their companies, or to place them in an internship. So its important that you choose the program carefully. Look for automotive design programs that are affordable, well respected, and offer a variety of necessary courses. You can also take beginner classes in automotive or transportation design during your undergraduate degree and then consider applying for a specialized program or degree in automotive design.
Most automotive design programs offer courses that focus on designing cars and other road vehicles, as well as the mechanical functions of automobiles and vehicle dynamics. You will also take classes on math, computer-aided drafting (CAD) and model making to prepare you for the industry.

, Some automotive designers decide to pursue a masterâs degree in the likelihood of qualifying for higher pay. You may also consider getting a masters in automotive engineering to expand your knowledge and skill set. However, having a masterâs degree is by no means a requirement for applying to automotive designer positions.A master's degree in industrial design or industrial engineering may also be a good option., Rather than dive head first into the competitive automobile design world, apply for internships at design firms in your last year of schooling. An internship will give you the opportunity to work with experienced professionals and to build your portfolio.Keep in mind most internships are unpaid. However, many internships can lead to employment at the company you are interning with, or a leg up on the competition if you apply for a position and the company is familiar with your work.

, Your portfolio should showcase your creativity and innovation. But it should also demonstrate an awareness of current design types and styles used by major automotive companies. Professional automotive designers are expected to engineer designs that will fit within an existing âcorporate lookâ or design portfolio of a company. Choose several big names in cars, such as Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen, and create sketches based on the existing designs of their cars.For example, Ford uses a theme called Kinetic Design. The design centers on the idea of a motionless object appearing as though it is moving. This theme influences the design of every Ford car, from sportier models like the Focus ST to family focused models like the 4x4. As a designer, you need to be able to work within this theme, while still demonstrating your creativity and innovation.Your portfolio should also showcase your abilities with computer-aided modelling and clay modelling to give employers a sense of your skill set.

, Focus on making an impression during your internship by asking for advice and guidance from mentors and other professionals. Build professional relationships with your peers and make a good impression on the superiors in the company by completing your tasks and demonstrating your skills during your internship.At the end of your internship, exchange business cards with any mentors or peers you feel you have connected with on a professional level. Have a discussion with your superior about possible job opportunities in the future and how you can further develop you skill set to make you a top candidate for employment at the company.

, Many car designers who are just starting out will join a professional organization to get a better handle on the industry. These organizations can help you meet other car designers in the field, discuss current innovations in car design, and network with more experienced designers.Ask your peers in your automotive program if they are part of any professional trade associations or look up professional automotive design organizations online. Start by contacting two major trade organizations in the field: The Industrial Designers Society of America and the Automotive Design Organization.

, These are great opportunities to meet key designers in the industry, check out the latest design innovations, and network with potential employers. Many trade associations will hold their own annual conferences, and may have connections to larger trade shows and conventions.


Bring business cards to trade shows and conferences for easy networking. Focus on being personable and engaged when you meet a potential contact.

, Many designers look for entry level positions at established corporations like General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, or Honda. The benefit of working for larger corporations is you are able to learn from a team of experienced designers, you can become familiar with a particular brand and theme, and you will likely earn a stable income. In the U.S., salaries can range from $43,000-$57,000., As a designer, you may be a good fit at a smaller, start-up alternate fuel company. Though you may receive a lower salary than a position at a large corporation, you will get to work on alternative designs and innovative approaches to alternate fuel cars., Often, upon graduation, you will need to be willing to go where you can find work. You may need to move overseas or across the country if a position comes up that would be a good fit.The average salary in the UK for car designers is around Â£50,000. UK manufacturers tend to develop niche sports or prestige car markets, instead of the more U.S. based âconsumerâ vehicles. So this means you may be eligible for a higher salary overseas.

Publish.",How to Be a Successful Engineer," You should try to get an early start if your goal is to be an engineer, during middle school and high school if you can. Engineers need a grounding in math and science, so plan your schedule around these subjects. Load up on the right classes and enroll in activities that will give you an edge when college admissions roll around.Make sure to take basic math courses like Algebra I &II, Geometry, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus. Take science courses like Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, too.Take as many advanced placement or honors classes as possible in these subjects. Success in honors courses will help you get into the program of your choice in college, while preparing you for the work required of engineers.Get involved in extracurricular activities, too. Go to a math or science camp in the summer, for example, or join the robotics club at your school. There are also regional, state, and nation-wide engineering competitions.Do anything that will give you a wider foundation.;
, Most major universities have engineering programs. Demand is also fairly high, so youâll probably be able to get a good job even without a degree from a top-tier school like Caltech or MIT. Still, there are factors to consider when applying.


Ideally, pick a school with a good reputation for engineering. All colleges are not created equal, and some programs are weaker than others. A degree from Western Michigan University is OK, but youâd do better at the more highly regarded University of Michigan or Michigan Tech.
Some colleges perform better in certain fields of engineering. Purdue and Michigan State University have excellent agricultural engineering programs, for instance, but are weaker in fields like civil and electrical engineering.Engineers earn about $72,000 out of school, but youâll still want to keep your tuition and debt as low as you can.A solid state school like Illinois Urbana-Champaign might be a better choice than an elite, pricy college like Stanford: $15,000 in-state costs vs. $46,000.
You might also look at location (i.e. are you willing to move away from home?) and which colleges offer internships and industry coops, which will give you early on-the-job experience., Just like high school, itâs important to get good marks in your coursework in college and to build up your resume with an eye to the future. Take the required coursework, see what sort of work suits you best, network, and get involved in extracurricular activities.


All the usual advice for school applies: attend lecture and lab, take notes, do your homework, set up a study routine, and apply yourself.
Try to participate in engineering-related activities, like your universityâs engineering club or math and science competitions. These experiences will help you to get experience working with teams and in informal leadership roles.
Consider taking a business class. Engineers donât just need to be technically proficient, but also able to navigate business relationships with clients, lawyers, and regulatory officials. It may also help you network.Keep busy all year round. If you want to be successful, you shouldnât expect to spend the summers sitting around. Use them to get practical experience, either working or as an intern.

, At some point, either before or during college, youâll need to put thought into what KIND of engineer you want to be. There are dozens of fields and subfields in engineering, from aerospace and chemical to nuclear and mining. Each field offers different kinds of work and job possibilities.Do your research. Be aware of the possible fields outside of the major areas of electronic, mechanical, civil, and chemical engineering.
You might want to think about what fields will be hiring. At the moment, it looks like renewal resources and energy have a bright future and will create lots of high-income jobs.
But the future can be unpredictable. Think also about what gets you excited. Do you like to write code in your spare time? Maybe computer engineering is a good choice for you. Like tinkering? You could be a great mechanical engineer.
Keep in mind that your field can affect where you eventually live and work. For instance, many chemical and petrochemical engineering jobs are near oil and natural gas deposits. As an aerospace engineer you might have to move to the major industry hubs in Texas or Florida.

, Engineering is split into four main fields or disciplines: civil, chemical, electrical, and mechanical. Each of these disciplines is split again into all sorts of subfields. In deciding on your major and field, take a close look at each of the four.For example, civil engineers create the built environment of modern civilization, i.e. bridges, roads, airports, energy systems, etc. They might also be involved in mining, transit, or traffic engineering, or in designing a better car door or more durable road surface.
Chemical engineers deal with materials and material processes â the production, transport, and transformation of materials. In this field you might work for the petro or energy industry or develop new processes to make polymers or drugs. Chemical engineers do much of their work in labs.Mechanical engineers get products from idea to the marketplace. They use physics and math to understand all the forces that go into a product and its production and try to find the best way to build it and prevent failures.Electrical engineers apply physics and the math of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism to electrical systems and processes. They might design electrical components, build communications networks, or work for computer or utilities companies., There are countless subfields within the four big disciplines, as well. A chemical engineer can also be a paper engineer, for example, involved in the processes that turn raw materials into paper and ink. A mechanical engineer can be a marine or aerospace engineer, designing ships, planes, or spacecraft.There are even subfields that âengineerâ people. Industrial engineers study how people work, using modeling and time-studies to make processes more efficient and productive.

, One of the most important things you can do to cement your field in college is to complete an internship. One or more internships will look good to employers in the private sphere. They will also give you a first-hand taste of the field, letting you see whether or not it is really for you.Start early. Internships are competitive. Visit your collegeâs career and internship center to find out about opportunities. Put together a resume and copies of your college transcripts for applications.
Think about your interests and possible locations. Are you willing to take an internship in an area outside of your ideal focus? Are you willing to move for the summer?
Cultivate relationships with professors. Network and get to know your instructors. Employers may ask for one or two professional references and you will need their support.
Letâs reiterate: internships in engineering are HUGE. In fact, one just might start your career. About 80% of employers see them as a source for full-time hires., Once you graduate from college with an engineering degree, the next step is to work toward professional certification. First, you should take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. This test is given by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) and gives you the right to present yourself as an engineer. A passing mark also lets you work as an independent consultant and can be an advantage on in the job hunt.The FE is a computer-based exam tailored to your discipline. You should prep for the test, because itâs not easy: 116 multiple choice questions in an allotted time of 6 hours.
After youâve passed the FE exam and worked in the field for four years, youâll be eligible to take the professional engineering (PE) exam. Once you complete this step, youâll be a certified professional engineer and can expect more trust and responsibility from clients.

, Even though engineers are in high demand, finding a job wonât necessarily be easy. Prepare yourself for the long-haul. Take the application process seriously, prepare, and tailor your materials to each job.To find opportunities, search company websites and attend career fairs at your college. Apply to jobs in your field and any others you might be qualified for and enjoy.
Put thought into your resume. Tweak it to highlight your academic and personal strengths, software proficiencies, and concrete accomplishments. Make sure that the resume looks crisp, clean, and professional.
Polish your online presence. This means removing any damaging material from Facebook, Instagram, and other social media accounts while building up a positive presence. Create a LinkedIn account or perhaps even a slick, professional website.
Tailor applications to each job. Employers wonât waste time on a generic cover letter. Make sure to do your research. Know what the company does, what the job entails, and anticipate what theyâre looking for â then, sell yourself as someone who fills that gap.

, Get ready for a series of formal and informal talks and interviews before you get the job, both over the phone and in person. These interviews are your chance to sink or swim. If you prepare ahead of time, however, you are sure to have a higher rate of success.Research and study before each interview. The interviewers will want to see that you understand what their company does and what the job requires. They are also looking for signs that you can fill the role.
Try to anticipate. Based on what you know about the job, what questions do you think that the interviewers will ask? Form answers to these beforehand.
Interviews can take a variety of shapes. It might be a question and answer session. Or, the interviewers could ask you to talk about situations: i.e., âTell us about a time when others resisted a procedure you introduced. How did you respond? How did you gain support?â The latter is a popular method right now.
Another format is the case approach. Here, the interviewers will present a hypothetical problem and ask you to solve it, step-by-step.
A few companies use a âstressâ test to gauge how you react to difficult situations. They will ask aggressive questions, interrupt, and change topic suddenly to judge how you handle it. The key is not to get rattled.
Always have follow-up questions, i.e. âWhat are your firmâs priorities for the next five years?â âWhat is the greatest challenge that youâre facing right now?â or âHow do you measure success? Can you give me some examples?â This shows you have put thought into the company and interview.

, Like most science fields, engineering as a profession is constantly evolving. To be a good engineer, itâs important to stay current with developments in the field. Read up on the kind of engineering you practice, for example, and stay abreast of the latest trends.Consider subscribing to a professional magazine, like Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Engineering and Technology.
Join a professional organization like the National Society for Professional Engineers and make the newsletters required reading, as well.

, Staying current means practicing the science. Work on an idea you have outside of work or ask your boss if you can try something new in a project.


If you have an exceptionally innovative idea, you can apply for grants offered by organizations that support this kind of work â like those offered by the National Science Foundation.Be aware of professional certification opportunities in your subfield, too. For instance, industrial engineers can take Lean Manufacturing Certification courses, which advise on how to limit waste in manufacturing processes and supply chains., Not all engineers need to publish scientific papers. But, youâre more than welcome to try if youâre ambitious or just have an interesting and innovative idea. Write up your idea or case-study and submit it to an engineering magazine or scholarly journal.


Try titles like the International Journal of Engineering Science, the Journal of Engineering, or the International Journal for Plasticity.
Publishing your paper will usually mean a double-blind peer review. This means that the journal sends your paper out to one or more experts for feedback. You donât know who they are, and they donât know who you are.
Expect to wait. Peer-review and publishing can take as long as a year. Youâll probably have to revise the paper, even if itâs conditionally accepted (revise and resubmit). It will take several more months to appear in print, but itâs well worth the wait!

Physics and calculus are the back bones of engineering courses; understanding them is key to getting a degree. Certain types of engineering will require knowledge of computer programming, learn it sooner than later.;
, Try engineering contests, too, if they are active in your area.

, These may include astronomy, rocketry, geology, auto mechanics, bicycle repair, welding, or even robotics. Any sort of tinkering is good practice.

, Hammers and screwdrivers are a great place to start, but there are many more types than that. If you have the opportunity to take a wood, metals, or plastics shop class, do so. Auto shop is also a good choice. Don't forget to learn about various kinds of measuring tools, too.

, Ask friends and family to give you appliances and other machines that have broken, or gather them inexpensively from garage sales or even neighbors' curbs. Then, open them up and see what makes them go. If you can put something back together so that it works, great! If not, figure out what's inside and see what you can learn from it before throwing it out. If you're still not sure what's going on in there, look it up and find out.
, Build stereo speakers for fun. Constructing speakers requires both woodworking and electrical skills. Learn the resistor code for fun. Although electronics are more closely associated with electrical engineering, mechanical engineers need, at the very least, to be able to communicate with electrical engineers. More and more systems are electro-mechanical, so it's good to know a bit of both. Some mechanical engineers do specialize in electrical engineering and become electro-mechanical engineers.

, Even though some engineering schools do not offer drafting classes, drafting classes may be available at the high school or community college level. If at all possible, learn a CAD (computer-aided drafting) program or two.

, Documentation and technical writing skills are a must in many mechanical engineering jobs.

, It doesn't have to be the next light bulb, or even a new idea. It could be something as simple as a bent wire coat hanger to dislodge something that always sticks. It could even be a new process or a more efficient way of organizing your desk or going about your day-to-day tasks. Or, see how far you can make a mousetrap- or gravity- powered vehicle go.

, Assemble boxed furniture or start from scratch. Make a potato launcher. Create your own lava lamp or trebuchet. Even fun or silly projects will help you get used to thinking about how things work, and how they are built.

, Where do paper clips come from? How about computer chips or jelly beans? Part of a mechanical engineer's job is to design things so that they can be efficiently, inexpensively fabricated.

, Although a lot of mechanical engineering is about being systematic and analytical, it is also about creative problem solving. Try drawing, writing, juggling, playing music, listening, playing, learning, and exploring. It will make you a better engineer and a more well-rounded person, in general.

, Some states may offer certification through examinations. Those without degrees or state certification may work as mechanical designers or drafters, rather than as engineers. Also, check the local and internet listings to see what engineering jobs are in your area or areas you don't mind moving to as it is possible a job that may interest you may not be available in your area.

,


Larger universities may offer a wider variety of coursework and the ability to specialize as well as bachelor degrees and usually up to doctorate degrees while smaller community colleges typically offer associate degrees and/or the ability to transfer to a bachelor level college.
Smaller colleges or technical schools may offer smaller classes and more of a ""hands on"" approach to engineering, and most offer accepted accredited engineering degrees. Some of the best engineering schools are small colleges: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, New Mexico Tech and Montana Tech are examples of small schools with excellent engineering programs. Beware of commercial trade schools that offer technical programs.
Confirm that your schools, colleges or universities of choice offer regionally accredited programs.

, There is a lot of hard work associated with getting any engineering degree. At some point you probably will fail classes and question your decision; just keep pushing, all good things take time and effort. Retake classes if you have to: a four year engineering degree takes most people about five years.

However, when working for others, you'll be exposed to a variety of different tastes and styles. You'll have to be able to show an extensive knowledge of space planning, fabrics and materials and you'll also have to be able to work with different personalities. List areas that may be challenging, and start working on them.You will also need great organizational and business skills to handle jobs competently and efficiently.;
, You won't have to have a degree to work as an interior decorator, but some classes or certifications can give you greater credibility. Many community colleges offer associates degrees, and colleges often have certification programs or short courses on interior design. Online programs and classes in home staging or organizing can be helpful as well. Besides all of that, you can begin teaching yourself immediately. Learn the fundamentals, such as types of materials, decorating history and popular decorating styles., Volunteer to help friends and family with decorating projects. Look for volunteer projects with local organizations. Look for service organizations like Habitat for Humanity and local shelters. Even decorating spaces for special events is good experience.

, Make sure to take photographs of all projects that you complete. Keep hard copies as well as showing off your work online. Groups on Flickr, HGTV and other design sites as well as decorating blogs all offer opportunities to show off your work as well as network with others who share your interest and can give you more information about how to become an interior decorator.You may need to take on jobs for free at first in order to expand your portfolio.
Making sure your portfolio translates to an electronic form is critical. In order to get the most out of your portfolio, you will want to create a website that highlights your work and keep an active blog to promote what you've done.
Utilize any and all popular social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or Wanderfly. These sites are great spaces to share your work and engage in discussions with other people interested in interior decoration.

, Look for a job in interior decorating or visual merchandising. Competition is high, so a high paying, professional job may not be easy to find. However, you can get started by working in a furniture store, design center, or local department store. A job that offers a chance to do some decorating and visual merchandising--arranging items that attract buyers' attention and are pleasing to the eye--will add to your experience and portfolio., The first step in starting any business is drafting a usable business plan. You can find some help with this process here. A good business plan consists of many things. You are trying to outline some basic concepts, like how your business will generate money and customers, how much it will cost to operate the business, and how you intend to expand or grow your business. Some things to address are:


It may be helpful to meet with your local Small Business Development Center. SBDC's provide help during all of the stages of a businessâ life cycle and can help you put a business plan together.Address your customer base. In your business plan, you will need to identify how you will drum up business. With interior decoration businesses, word of mouth and local advertising are effective ways of building a customer base.Address your financial situation in your business plan. Depending on how large or small you want to go with your interior decoration business, you may need to rally investors to support your efforts. In order to get others to invest in your business, you need to determine how much money you will need, how much you will generate, and how you will pay back any investors. If you think your business will need employees, make sure to discuss hiring tactics and what these employees will cost you in your business plan. , Even if you plan to keep your business small and the overhead costs low, you will need a business license from the township, city or municipality where you intend to operate the business. Getting the proper licenses can help you get discounts on materials and increases your legitimacy in the eyes of potential customers.


Your interior decoration business will most likely require a âBusiness Occupancy Licenseâ. These licenses are acquired from your city or township, are fairly inexpensive and do not require site inspections.

, Youâll need some money to get things started, mostly to cover the cost of materials. Your startup costs for an interior design business can be low, but you will need a business license. You might also need to rent office or storage space, depending on how large you want your business to be., Find sources for materials and supplies. Without a license, you may not be entitled to designer discounts. However, you can begin to negotiate with suppliers if you are buying in bulk. You can also learn to find inexpensive sources for materials like overstock stores and thrift shops., You will want to advertise your services to potential customers. Paid advertising on local television or the local newspaper can be effective. Also, make sure you take the necessary steps to promote your business online, as a majority of people who need interior design help will probably turn to the internet to find someone. Finally, your business will rely heavily on word of mouth advertisement. People who see your work will get your name from friends, family and acquaintances and seek you out.


You absolutely must have a business card in this line of work. Make sure your cards look professional and hand them out liberally. Leave cards with every client you work with., You may find that your business expands to a point that you canât possibly handle all of the work yourself. If this happens, you will need to hire some help. Be sure that the person or people you hire have the same sensibility and attitude towards decorating that you do. You want your interior design company to have its own style., You can work remotely in interior decorating. Essentially, people take pictures of the space they need decorated, send them to you, and you, for a fee, can draft a decorating plan for the client without ever stepping foot in their home or business. This can be a really effective way to work in interior decorating without maintaining a brick and mortar business., An interior designer is not an interior decorator. These are two different jobs, that require slightly different skill sets and have different educational and certification requirements. As a general rule, interior designers are far more employable and tend to make more money than interior decorators., The main difference between a designer and a decorator is education. To become an interior designer, you need to enroll in courses on interior design at a university, community college, or design school. These courses help you learn about interior design in order to pass licensing and certification exams, while also helping you learn the technical aspects of design, such as working within the guidelines laid out in local and municipal building ordinances., Depending on what state you live in, the licensing requirements and guidelines are different. Some states don't require any licensing for interior designers while other states will not allow you to work in interior design without a license. Whether your state requires licensing or not, you really need a license to be viewed as a legitimate and employable interior designer.In many states, you need to pass the NCIDQ (National Council for Interior Design Qualification) exam to receive your license to practice interior design.California has its own certification process overseen by the CCIDC (The California Council for Interior Design Certification).You will need to identify the licensing process for interior designers in your state, as practices and exams vary widely., Just like decorators, designers need to keep a record of the jobs they have completed and have evidence of the quality of their work. You can populate your portfolio more quickly if you are initially willing to work for free or take on design projects for friends or charitable organizations with small budgets. Make sure you take high quality photographs of your work to include in your portfolio.It is wise to be able to convert your portfolio to an electronic format. This will be helpful when applying to jobs or promoting your skills on the internet.

, Interior designers are needed for residential and commercial jobs. They are also far more employable than decorators, making finding a job easier. Look on any popular job search site (like Monster, Indeed, or Careerbuilder) for work in interior design."

Start preparing for your car design career in high school.,
Decide what area of automotive design interests you most.,
Build a design portfolio.,
Choose the right college program for you.",How to Become an Automobile Designer," Art and design classes are obvious classes to take to develop your drawing skills, but as an automobile designer, you also need fluency physics and mathematics to craft lightweight cars with low wind resistance. You also need to develop your writing and computer skills with English and computer classes.


Because the automotive design business is becoming an international business, knowledge of 1 or more foreign languages may be beneficial as well.;
, Automobile designers can work in 1 of 3 areas: exterior design, interior design, or color/trim design.


Exterior designers decide what the outside of the vehicle looks like. Automotive exterior designers sketch designs, convert them into digital format, and then sculpt their designs into clay.
Interior designers focus on making the vehicle interior comfortable for the driver and passengers and placing the controls and creature comforts in the places most accessible to the vehicle occupants without affecting safety. Interior designers also sketch their designs on paper and computer and then sculpt them in clay.
Color/trim designers decide what materials (metal, wood grain, leather, fabric, carpeting) are to be used on the inside and outside of the vehicle to make it most visually appealing and comfortable. Color/trim designers are primarily researchers; they don't build models, although they may construct computer simulations of their design ideas.

, Because automotive design schools are so competitive, you'll need to have a portfolio of design concepts to show your potential. This portfolio can be either in hard copy or in digital format, depending on the requirements of the school you plan to attend.


If your high school lacks the classes and resources to help you build your design portfolio, you may want to consider an associate's industrial design degree from a community college to build a suitable portfolio.

, You have several options to pursue college training to become an automobile designer:


You can go for a bachelor's degree in industrial design, and then either obtain a graduate degree in transportation engineering/automotive design or land an entry-level position in industrial design and use that experience to springboard to an automobile designer position. There are several hundred college-level industrial design programs around the world.
You can go for a bachelor's degree as an automotive engineer and try to use your experience to become an automobile designer. This can be a harder path, as most car companies have about 20 automotive engineers for every designer, and most automotive engineers are more logical than creative, making the change in mindset difficult.
You can attend an automotive design school with an undergraduate program. There are about 20 such worldwide. You can follow earning your bachelor's degree with going for your master's.
You can get your bachelor's degree in graphic design, furniture design, architectural design, or interior design and then go for a master's in automobile design. This path would be appropriate if you're making a career change from one design field to another.
Regardless of which path you choose, look for a school that offers computer-aided drafting (CAD) courses and has connections to the automotive design departments of 1 or more automakers. You can also look for a school as close to where you presently live as possible, although this may not be a practical requirement if you wish to attend an undergraduate automotive design program.

Work honestly.",How to Be a Prepared Engineering Student," In most schools you do not have to declare your major until your second year of college. Therefore, selecting the broad field of engineering will allow you time to decide on what you want to specialize in. Many of the classes you will take as an underclassman are prerequisites for several different engineering fieldsâmechanical, civil, electrical, chemical, nuclear, ... Taking the general courses may guide your choice if you haven't yet targeted a specific path to take through the engineering world.;
, Engineering students are generally required to take several physics and calculus based classes. Some of the classes you should be expecting to take:


differential equations
analytical physics
general biology
general chemistry
mechanicsâstress and materials

, Being organized and having the right materials for your classes is key in becoming a successful engineering student. You cannot wait until the first week or second week of school to go out and get your books, binders and notebooks like you used to do in high school. The engineering classes that you will be taking are challenging, so they're easy to fall behind in if you donât have the proper materials.

, You will be spending the next sixteen or more weeks with the students in your classes so itâs a good idea to make friends with them. In the above steps, you were able to see some of the advanced courses that you will be taking. Many engineering students in your first semester classes will be taking similar classes with you semester after semester, so it is good to become familiar with your fellow classmates.

, Engineering school and careers are all about teamwork and co-operating with each other. Working alone can be very frustrating if you find yourself having trouble with a problem. Working with others will not only introduce other viewpoints to approaching a problem, it will also provide encouragement to become more of a successful student. You have to get used to working with groups in engineering school because that is what is expected out of you once you graduate.

, Engineering courses require a lot of note taking. Make sure you are paying close attention to what your professors are saying. Just because they do not write on the board or on a slide does not mean you shouldn't write it down on your paper. Professors throughout the semester will give you slight hints on what is going to be on the quizzes and exams, so make sure you are writing down everything. Following that, you should keep all of your notes and exams from previous semesters. Maths, physics, and engineering courses build up on each other. For example, something you learned in calculus 3 might show up in statics. So you can pull out your old notes to get a refresher on that subject.

, There is no right or wrong way on how to study. That is why you need to figure out your own way on how to do so. Some people like to work in complete silence, others donât mind if they are in a loud environment. You need to spend several hours a week in your schoolâs library working on your studies and doing research.

, Studying on your own is not enough to be a successful engineering student. You need to make sure your professors know who you are. Take advantage of their office hours and tutoring sessions. This goes pass just getting a good grade in their courses. Most of your engineering professors are engineers themselves, some will help you thrive to being the best engineering student.

, Donât be scared to ask a question, there may be other students struggling too. Make sure you are asking different types of questions in your classes. This will give you a better understanding of the subject that you are learning. This will also familiarize your face with the professor going off the above steps. Professors love when students ask questions, it tells them that you are really interested in what they are lecturing about.

, Do not just copy what the solution manual has written down and think that will help you be a successful student. This will not be helping you in any way. Most of the time in engineering school homework is not even collected. It is for your own good to perform the assigned problems to help you on exams.

, Exams should be your number one priority during engineering school. They are what the countless hours of studying will be for. It is so important to be prepared for an exam. Make sure for every exam you bring at least two pencils with erasers, a calculator, and whatever else is needed for your exam (scantron, bluebook, etc.). Donât stress yourself out too much, engineering exams can be very challenging with different problem solving skills. If you do not know the answer to a problem skip it and come back to it. Usually the other problems will help you get a good idea on the problem you are struggling on.

, Cheating will get you no where in life, if it has worked for you in the past it will not work for you in engineering school. Make sure you are doing your own work and you will be the best possible student you can be.

Understand the profession.,
Decide what type of architect you want to be.,
Talk to architects.",How to Become an Architect1," Architecture involves more than an aptitude for drawing or basic carpentry. Architects are involved in each phase of the process of creating a new structure, from conceiving the idea for the structure's design to communicating the plans to clients to overseeing the construction process and ensuring the final structure is satisfactory. Architects have the following talents and skills:


They are creative. Architects come up with original ideas for creating well-designed structures that complement their surroundings and suit their functional purpose. Every seemingly simple structure we encounter was dreamed up by an architect aiming for the sweet spot of beauty and functionality.
They are science-minded. Architecture is both an art and a science. In addition to designing buildings with elegance and beauty in mind, architects must understand how the different components of a building work together to create a sturdy, safe environment. An understanding of math and physics is essential.
They are good communicators. Architects must effectively share their vision for a structure with the client who will be constructing it. They are excellent at giving presentations, describing their ideas clearly and ensuring client satisfaction.;
, Some architects work for firms and see projects through from conception to completion. Others use their talents and skills in different parts of the industry.


Landscape architects have a background in plant sciences as well as architecture, and focus on how spaces outside buildings play a complementary role.
Some architects focus only on design, making sure the plans for a building follow building codes and meet the expectations of the client.
Construction firms often hire architects as project managers who oversee the construction of structures.
Architects may focus on certain types of buildings, such as high-security facilities, hospitals, or schools. They may also work on restoration of old buildings.

, As you're deciding whether you want to become an architect, talk with licensed professionals to get a sense of what it takes to have a career in architecture.


Contact architecture firms in your area and ask if you can set up informational interviews. Ask for architecture program recommendations and other advice.
Find a part-time job or internship at an architecture firm to get an even better sense of what the field is like.

, Each state requires that potential architects complete an IDP before they are granted licensure. The programs are designed to give hands-on exposure in the areas of pre-design, design, project management and practice management.


Most IDP programs take about three years to complete.
It is possible to begin an IDP while you are still enrolled in school. Hours spent working in an architecture firm or completing school projects may count toward the IDP.

, The ARE has sections relating to may facets of the architect profession, and assesses whether the architecture candidate has the knowledge and skills needed to perform an architect's role.


The test has more components than can be completed in one day. Candidates are required to schedule a day to take each section of the test until they are all completed.

Measure the width of your whiteboard.,
Locate studs within the wall.,
Drill a hole through the top and bottom of your whiteboard.,
Align the pre-drilled holes with studs.,
Place a level on top of your whiteboard.,
Place screws through the holes and into the studs.",How to Hang a Whiteboard1," Before you determine where to hang your whiteboard, measure its width.This will help you determine where to place the screws so they will effectively screw into the studs.If you have three studs, be sure to divide your measurements into threes. If you have two, divide into two, and so forth.;
, Drywall alone is not enough to hold up a whiteboard, so using a stud finder (or through simply knocking on the wall), identify the location of the studs adjacent to your chosen space. Mark the studs to refer back to.

To use a stud finger, place the finder flush against the wall, press the button, and slide it along the wall until you hear a âbeepâ indicating that a stud was located.
Measure the area between the studs, as well, to help you determine where to drill.

, Drill a hole into the top and bottom of your whiteboard, measuring the area to align with your studs. This is particularly crucial if your whiteboard has a metal frame, rather than a wooden one, as metal will not allow a screw to be drilled directly into it.Make sure you use a drill bit that matches the size of your screws.

, Place the pre-drilled holes against the wall in line with the studs you found. You can hold your board up by yourself, if it is small, or prop it up with a table or ladder if it is large.


You can also hold the board with one hand and screw the whiteboard into the wall with the other, if coordination allows.

, Before you place all of the screws into the wall, place a level on top of your whiteboard to make sure the top of your board is even. If it is not, quickly alter your placement.

You can tape your level to the top of the whiteboard to hold it in place as you try to maneuver it.

, Line your screws up with the holes youâve drilled. Pressing firmly, screw your whiteboard into the wall with an electric drill, trying to keep your screws as even as possible.If you find your arm slipping, or the screw going in sideways, stop and start again, keeping the screw steady and straight.
If you accidentally mess up on a hole, you can lift your whiteboard a few inches higher to hide the mistake.

Locate and clean a spot on the wall.,
Stick your hooks to the wall.,
Measure the space between your hooks.,
Affix eyelets to the back of the whiteboard.,
Hang your board.",How to Hang a Whiteboard2," Locate a spot on your wall that will fit your dimensions, and give it a quick wipe down with some water--or water and vinegar, if it is particularly dirty. Allow the space to dry before you continue.

To expedite the drying process, you can wipe the area with a clean, microfiber cloth. Terrycloth might leave behind residue that would make sticking difficult.

, Whether you are using sticker hooks or screw hooks, place your hooks on the wall. Measure to make sure they are spaced evenly, and placed at the right height.When you place your hooks, determine whether you want them to show above the board, or you want them to sit behind the board. This will determine where you place the eyelets.
If you use screw hooks, refer to the steps in the previous method to make sure the hooks are installed properly.

, Measure the space between the hooks to make sure the space between your whiteboard eyelets will line up. This measurement has to be exact, and the space between all hooks should be measured., Using the measurements taken in the previous step, affix your loops or eyelets to the back of your whiteboard, making sure they are straight and pressed firmly to the frame.Place your eyelets as straight as possible, as even a slight slant can make your board sit cock-eyed on the wall, or can make the hook unusable.

, Using the hooks and eyelets, hang your board on the wall. Place a level on top to ensure your board is straight. Check to make sure each hook is properly inserted into each eyelet; only having one or two hooks properly installed will weaken your boardâs stability."
"
Weigh your whiteboard.,
Wash your wall.,
Place a sticker patch every 6-8 inches.,
Remove the backs of the patches.,
Press the patches firmly to the wall.,
Check the stickers every 2-3 months.",How to Hang a Whiteboard3," Adhesive patches are intended for use on smaller objects. If your whiteboard weighs more than 3-4 pounds, an adhesive may not be strong enough to use. If it is under 3-4 pounds, you can hang it without risking damage to your wall.If you arenât sure how much your whiteboard weighs, you can use a kitchen scale, or you can stand on your own scale with the whiteboard in hand, then without, and subtract the difference.

, Before you begin hanging, watch your wall thoroughly, using water and vinegar, or a mixture of water and dish soap. Adhesive cannot stick to dirt, so you should not try to hang using adhesive on a dirty wall.

Make sure the wall has dried completely, then wipe down with a dry cloth to pick up any grease or dirt left behind after the initial wash.

, To make sure your board has an adequate amount of support, place an adhesive strip every 6-8 inches on your board. If your board is large, also place a strip midway down the height of your board.

If your board is small, place an adhesive strip in all four corners to ensure stability.

, Once the adhesive strips have been placed on the board itself, expose the adhesive intended for the wall. Do this step right before placing it on the wall, as industrial-strength adhesive attracts all manner of dust and debris.

If possible, remove a single adhesive strip at a time, and press it into the wall immediately.

, Making sure the whiteboard is level, press it into the wall, stopping to push each individual sticker firmly against the wall. Although the adhesive is stronger than a simple strip of scotch tape, it does rely upon heavy pressure to achieve a firm hold.You donât need to hammer the adhesive, but pushing against the adhesive for 30 seconds will help it stay in place.

, To make sure your whiteboard doesnât come crashing down unexpectedly, check the adhesive strips every 2-3 months, pressing them into the wall if you see any separation.

Some paint peels away gradually, so you may need to reapply some of your adhesive strips periodically.

Find an internship in an HR department.,
Look for work with your current company.,
Volunteer for a nonprofit organization.,
Consider taking an administrative support job in human resources.,
Work for a staffing company.,
Join an organization for HR professionals.,
Pursue certification.,
Network online with people in HR.,
Be open to starting out in different disciplines within HR.",How to Gain Experience in Human Resources," Since internships are meant specifically for people to gain experience in a field, they're the first step for many people who want to learn more about human resources. Because there is a great deal of administrative work in HR, many large and mid-sized departments regularly hire interns to help.;
, If you're currently employed, there may be projects going on in your own company's HR department that need staffing. Contact your HR representative and ask whether you can help. Not all projects involve confidential data, so you might be able to gain hands-on HR experience and learn more about your company in the process. If you already work in a division of your company's HR department, volunteer to help out in other divisions. For example, if you work in the benefits department, you might offer to help the recruitment department interview candidates at an upcoming career fair.

, Many small nonprofit groups do not have dedicated HR professionals, and there are no special credentials required to practice HR. If you're willing to work for free to gain HR experience, volunteering can help you gain exposure to higher level work than you might find in an entry-level HR job.

, Because HR is a field with a great deal of paperwork to process, there are usually a number of administrative positions in personnel departments. Many people seeking careers in human resources overlook these entry-level roles, but the people who fill them often are promoted over time. Many HR leaders started out as file clerks or receptionists.

, Agencies that place temporary personnel can be a great way to gain experience in areas that overlap into HR. Staffing companies evaluate, interview, hire and place large volumes of candidates, and experience in these areas can position you for a corporate recruiting position in a larger HR department. Unlike HR departments, staffing agencies frequently hire people from sales positions or recent college graduates, and usually do not require HR experience to get started.

, Networking with other HR professionals can help you find entry-level opportunities that you might not find elsewhere. Many open positions are not advertised, but are filled through word-of-mouth. Joining a professional association and attending meetings and other networking events regularly will help you meet people who are filling HR positions. Most HR organizations hold an annual conference, which is another opportunity to gain exposure to HR professionals and learn more about various topics in the field.

, The Human Resources Certification Institute (HRCI) offers 4 types of certification: Professional in Human Resources (PHR), Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR), Global Professional in Human Resources (GPHR), and certification for HR professionals in the state of California (PHR-CA and SPHR-CA). The Society for Human Resource Management offers extensive educational opportunities, including preparation courses for the various levels of certification.

, There are numerous blogs, Facebook and LinkedIn groups, Twitter lists and other online networking opportunities available for people who want to connect with others in the profession. Many HR associations now offer online networking opportunities as well, which allow you to connect with hiring professionals outside your geographic area. The Society for Human Resource Management, for example, has a members-only section of its website called ""HR Talk,"" which allows members to discuss a variety of HR-related topics.

, Human resources is a profession with a broad subset of areas, from compensation and benefits to recruiting to labor relations. Most HR professionals (especially those who rise to an executive level) spend time in several of these areas at some point in their careers. It's generally easier to find work in benefits in the fall, when HR departments are getting ready for open enrollment. Recruiting departments tend to be busiest at the beginning of a fiscal year and after the holidays, when hiring picks up, so those are the best times to volunteer to help. Compensation departments typically have a set cycle for reviewing organizational pay practices, so determining what that time frame is will help you choose the best time to offer your services in order to gain experience.

Tell your boss before anyone else.,
Do it in person.,
Consider what you would do if you got a counter-offer.,

Be prepared to leave that day if necessary.,
Consider what youâd do if youâre asked to stay longer.,
Give notice.,
Donât make it personal.,
Explain as much or as little as you want to.,

Write a formal letter if necessary.,
Show gratitude.,
Wrap up any unfinished projects.,
If you announce your new job on social media, do it gracefully.,
Remain focused until your time at work is over.,
Remember to leave a positive impression.",How to Give Notice at Work," One of the most important aspects of giving notice is making sure that your boss doesnât say âI knowâ when you finally give your notice. Though you may be dying to announce your new job or your intention to leave to your fifty closest co-workers, you should keep it to yourself and your family until your boss knows the score. You should do this out of respect for your boss and for the sake of professionalism.


Donât talk about it on social media, either. Make sure your boss and co-workers know before the world at large does.;
, Unless you and your boss live on opposite parts of the country, you should do your boss the service of meeting in person to discuss the fact that youâre leaving the company. Even if youâre not very close with your boss or you have some animosity toward him or her, you should make the effort to have an in-person conversation instead of sending a letter or an email. This sends the message that you take your work seriously and want to take the time and effort to leave on a good note.


If your boss lives somewhere else, then a phone call is preferable to an email or letter.

, You may be surprised by how quickly your boss may give you a counteroffer to get you to stay. Now, if your major complaint about your job is the lack of proper compensation, then this really could be a strong incentive to stay; if this is the case, then you should ask yourself what number you have in mind that would make you stay. Itâs important to know this before you go into the conversation so you donât get confused and make a mistake when the conversation comes.


If itâs no less than 10K more per yer, then you shouldnât settle for 5K just to make your boss happy; that said, itâs important to make this decision only if your main problem really is the lack of compensation, because money canât cover up the other problems you may be having with your job., Once you give your notice, your boss will want to know how you plan to wrap up your work. You should have a plan for how to finish up the projects you were working on, how to pass on duties, explain systems you might have set up, transition old clients, or do anything else to ensure that the company runs smoothly without your help. This will impress your boss and can help add some positive energy to the situation. This will also show that youâve put a lot of thought into leaving the company and that you care what happens there.

, While having a transition plan is a great idea, unfortunately, you may be up against an angry boss who demands that you leave right away. If this is the case, then you should be prepared to pack up your things as quickly as possible. While you shouldnât pack up your cubicle before you talk to your boss, you should make sure to gather any important paperwork from the office in the event that you are asked to leave immediately.


Though this doesnât happen very often, it is possible if your boss gets angry or emotional. Be prepared for it just in case so you know what to do next.

, Itâs possible that your boss will ask you to stay an extra week or two to help the company get its footing. If youâre flexible with the start date of your new job and really care about the company doing well in your absence, then you should ask yourself if youâre prepared to do this in advance.


If youâre absolutely committed to having some time off between jobs to get your head together, then make sure you have a firm idea of this before you talk to your boss. After all, youâre leaving and your boss canât really force you to stay unless there is something that absolutely canât be done without you.

, When you talk to your boss, the most important thing is to keep it short and sweet. Simply say that youâre leaving the job, state when your last day will be, and thank him or her for the opportunity. Your boss will ask more questions and you can reveal a bit more, but you shouldnât feel compelled to talk at length about the decision; the most important thing is that you state your decision clearly and in no uncertain terms.


This wonât be fun or easy, but youâll feel a sense of relief once you get the news out of the way. Donât waste your time with small talk and come out with it.
Make sure you choose your words carefully. State that youâre sorry to share this news and that itâs unfortunate that youâre leaving instead of saying youâre out of there.

, Though you may be tempted to tell your boss that you feel like your full potential was never realized, that you were always condescended to, that no one took your ideas seriously, or that the company culture stifled any attempt at fun or socializing, this really wonât get you anywhere as you get ready to leave. Save your personal complaints for your friends and try to focus on the fact that youâre advancing your career, not settling a personal score., Thereâs no need to go into great detail about why youâre leaving your job. If youâre quitting without another job lined up, you donât need to explain exactly why you hate working for your boss; if you do have another job lined up, you can mention that it may help you advance your career goals without saying how much better the pay will be and that you were tired of being treated like you had no value.Your boss may ask if youâre taking another job or may want to know the details of the new position. Youâre not obligated to say anything, though you can mention that youâre excited for the opportunity.

, You may be so focused on just coming out with the news that you may not really be thinking about what happens next, but itâs important to ask about the logistics before you leave your bossâs office. Ask about the employee benefits and salary youâll receive after you leave, ask about collecting your extra vacation days and sick pay, and see if you can keep, cash in, or rollover your 401K or other pension plan. If your boss is too angry or emotional, then you should ask about these as soon as possible, but you should really see if you can get answers during the meeting.Itâs important to get all of the benefits you can before you leave. Donât miss out on any compensation you deserve simply because you feel guilty about leaving.

, If you really do care about the success of the company, then one thing you can do is to offer to help hire a replacement so that your position doesnât stay vacant for very long. Itâs likely that you know the ins and outs of your job better than anyone else, and that you can be a great asset in helping hire â and even train, if thereâs time â someone to fill your shoes. This can offer a big relief to your boss and can help ease the loss.Of course, if you really feel done with the company, you arenât required to do this. However, if you want to leave on good terms, this can be a helping factor.

, Itâs natural that quitting your job will give you an emotional feeling, especially if you have a lot of complicated feelings toward your job or if youâve been working there for a long time. However, if you want things to go as smoothly as possible, then you should try to keep your cool, avoid getting angry or saying something youâll regret, and to take deep breaths if you feel yourself losing your cool.If you and your boss have developed a close relationship, then itâs natural that youâll feel some sadness. However, itâs important to keep your cool as much as you can so that you make your plan clearly and canât be dissuaded.

, Though you may feel the need to tell your boss the ten worst qualities she possesses or to detail every single thing you absolutely hate about your job, you should avoid those kinds of thoughts. They are completely unproductive and will only make your boss angry or sad. Giving feedback while youâre at the company in hopes of things improving is one thing, but if youâre already set to leave, then focus on talking about the things you loved about the company instead of complaining or ranting.If you really have to rant about your job, tell a close friend all of the things you hated about it. Focus on the things you liked when you talk to your boss, and if you genuinely canât think of any, then silence is the best policy here.

, Even if the conversation doesnât end very well, or doesnât go very well, itâs important to leave on a note of thankfulness. Let your boss see that he or she has done so much for you and that youâre grateful for all of the opportunities that youâve had and all the skills that youâve gained. Make a point of looking your boss in the eye and truly saying thank you. This will leave a good impression and will make it easier to move on.


You can even think about this in advance to cite specific examples of projects your boss has helped you on, or qualities you had built with his help.

, Take the time to let your colleagues know that youâre leaving the company. You donât have to tell each and every person that youâre leaving, and you can decide to notify people you donât interact with frequently by email if itâs necessary. However, if there are people youâve built connections with, or even just people youâve been working with for years, then you may be surprised by how sad they will be to see you go. Take the time to tell them individually and to show that you really care and that youâll miss them a lot.


Make sure to really slow down when you give them the news. Donât be flippant or casual about it; they are likely to be emotionally affected.

, You may feel a surge of relief about finally getting out of your job, but that doesnât mean your colleagues feel the same way about the position. You should avoid bad-mouthing the job, saying your boss is a jerk, or saying that you canât wait to start working somewhere new. This will set a bad tone and will leave your co-workers to be bitter and resentful that youâre leaving.This will especially make any co-workers who are on the job hunting and not seeing results feel especially bitter and jealous.
Also, if you complain about the job to them, it may get back to your boss, which will make your relationship more difficult.

, If you promised your boss that you would stay for two more weeks or even longer, then you should stick to that time frame. You want to end on a good note and not bow out early just because youâre feeling like packing up. Make a lasting impression by sticking to your final promise at this job and be proud of yourself for making an impact.


You want your boss to serve as a positive reference for you in the future, so you shouldnât do anything that would make him change his opinion of you.

, Some companies will ask that you write a resignation letter even after youâve given notice. This is to keep a statement for their records, and you should keep the note amicable, concise, and clear. All you have to do is address your boss, state that youâre resigning from your job, and state the date that youâll be resigning on as well. You can also decide whether or not to give a reason for leaving, though thereâs no need to say anything negative or to go into great detail about all of the things you donât like about the company.Make sure you write the letter with a cool head. Your company will have it on record and can refer to it if future employers call, so you shouldnât say anything youâll regret later because there will be no taking it back.

, Before you leave your job, itâs important to take the time you need to thank all of the people who have helped you along the way. This can include your boss, former managers, co-workers, or even clients or anyone else youâve interacted with in the workplace. This shows that you have put a lot of thought and appreciation into your time at work and that youâre not walking away with your nose high in the air. You can write thank you cards to show your gratitude or just take the time to show people how much you really care for them one-on-one.You may feel like your job was completely thankless and like you just want to get out of there as fast as you can. However, thanking people is also a courtesy and you should swallow your pride and find something to be thankful for.

, As you finish your last days at work, you should try your hardest to wrap up any unfinished business so that your boss and company have an easier time transitioning without you. You can work on wrapping up projects, helping other employees or new hires take them over, and just tie up any loose ends that couldnât have been tied up without you. You should create a list of tasks that you need to complete before you leave your job so you donât leave your boss stranded.


Of course, it may not be possible to wrap up absolutely everything you did at work in the last two or three weeks of your time at the company.

, You can tell people that youâre excited about starting a new job, but you should either not mention your old job or say something nice about all the things you learned. Donât talk about how youâre so glad to be leaving that horrible place and that youâre sick of working with incompetent morons. You may not be friends with anyone from work on Facebook, but you should still be careful with what you say, because people tend to have a way to find out if youâre bad mouthing them.


Furthermore, if your new company sees this kind of post, then there will be some questions about your loyalty or how much you can be trusted. They may be wary of developing a similar relationship with you.

, You may think itâs impossible to be focused during your last two weeks of work when you know you have a more exciting opportunity ahead. However, you just have to put your best foot forward and work on doing what you have to do, being friendly to coworkers, being attentive at meetings, and getting your workload done every day. You should also try to whistle while you work as much as you can â you donât want people to remember you having a bad attitude.One of the most important things you can do is actually stay to work the whole day. Donât leave early, or youâll be showing off and looking like youâre too good for your job. You donât want people to remember you like that.

, This is the overall most important thing you need to do as you wrap up your time at your office. Even if you feel like you worked in a toxic environment where everyone was pretty mean or catty, you should take the high road and not tell people what you really think. Have a smile on your face as you finish out your last days and make sure that people remember you as a happy, hardworking person. Your boss will serve as a reference for you in the future, and you donât want to undo all of the hard work youâve done just by coming off as ungrateful in the last few weeks at your company.Though it may feel good to tell off a co-worker or a boss for about five seconds, severing your relationships with people can have a lasting effect on your professional career.

Pique the individuals interest in some way. You'll want to let the person know exactly how you can help fulfill her needs later one. This can also be a good time to mention any free offers or special promotions that are available for new clients.
Be sure to provide business prospects with your contact information, including your full name, phone number and a business email address. This allows interested individuals a way to get in touch with you.
Close your conversation or email with something friendly. This is another area where you can make a personal connection. For example, you could mention that you look forward to seeing the potential client at the next little league game.

, Briefly state the reason for your call, let the person know you will try to reach him again and close with an upbeat ending or well wishes.


Stay in touch with business prospects and past customers. The chance for a successful sale decreases dramatically after the first 72 hours after your initial contact.

, Some companies use a standard follow-up process, making contact at 24 hours, 72 hours and 2 weeks. Also, contact your leads any time you have a new special or promotion.

, This can help you tailor your proposal each time you talk.

Look at your current situation.,
Look at your goals.,
Prepare!,
Get your arguments together.,
Take into account the Timing.,
Negotiate!",How to Get the Pay Raise You Deserve," Where are you now? Ask yourself the question: do I really deserve a pay raise? Have I contributed to the company in such an amount, that it should give something back to me? If the answer is YES, then take the next step, else you should wait until you really earned it.;
, Where are you going? Do you want more money or more time? I know, that for most of us it's the money, but what is money for? You have to buy things, right? If your company can give you the things you want, then you should directly ask for those. Maybe what you actually need is a company car or a cell phone. Or you might be needing more time with your family (in this case you should ask for less working hours).

, Don't rush into your boss' office tomorrow morning screaming and yelling for more money. Preparation is a key element when asking for a pay raise. You have to prepare the field before the battle. Make yourself noticeable, help out your colleagues, take on some extra work, go to some seminars. In short: make yourself look better.

, You need professional reasons in order to convince your boss, that you deserve that raise. Here is how to think about your arguments: what are those things, that you have done or will do, that benefit your boss or your company? Don't start whining about your family, children and such. Your boss doesn't care. All he cares about is himself and the company. What benefits can you bring to them? What have you done lately for the company? If you can't find anything, then you should go back to step 1.

, There are moments and periods, when you shouldn't even think about asking for a pay raise (the company is downsizing or losing money, your boss is just divorcing, etc... you get the idea). Wait for the right moment. Is your company making higher profits, than last year? Do other people around you get promoted? Have you got some spectacular results in the past months?\

, Yes, this is the last step. If you have followed the first 5 steps correctly, then you shouldn't have problems with this one. Do not beg! Your are equal partners in this. Have a normal conversation like adults. Bring up your arguments, present your case and wait for the answer.

Eliminate any catalogs that you don't need.,
Work with the purchasing department and anybody who specifies material for purchase (engineering, management, etc.),Date the catalogs you plan to keep and make a note on them (perhaps inside the front cover) if you use them.,Periodically clean out the collection, removing anything that has not been used in a long time and anything that is so out of date as to be incorrect.,
Set aside a space for the rest.,
Consolidate.,
Choose a filing scheme, and go for simplicity.,Tidy up the library occasionally, especially if several people are using it.,
Get fresh copies of catalogs you use frequently.",How to File Catalogues from Potential Suppliers Efficiently,"

Toss the older copies of any duplicates.
Throw out anything that's irrelevant to your business. If you know your business buys its electronics and computers complete, you may never need to order a single resistor. If you don't have a factory floor to maintain, you don't need a floor sealant for it.
Discard any sales literature that has more shine than content. You can't order anything from that glossy brochure that says what a great company they are, so don't keep it.;
, to establish an approved vendor list. These are companies or vendors that are central to your business. If you already have a purchasing database or even a stack of old purchase requisitions, look back through it. Vendors that your firm uses rarely or never and any vendors that have caused difficulties (late delivery, excessive fees) should go on the list only if they supply something you need but can't get elsewhere.

As you order from each vendor again, make a point to add contact details to your database.
Use your approved vendor list to cull the collection further. If you think you need to keep a catalog, ask whether the company who sent it belongs on the list.

,,, Stake out a bookcase or filing cabinet., It might be helpful for each person to have a copy of catalogs that are used very frequently. For all the rest, could the entire department share a shelf, library-style?

Catalogs can get heavy, so be sure to choose a sturdy shelf.

, Alphabetically by manufacturer or supplier is probably not a bad choice, since there's only one way to arrange them. For a larger collection, you may wish to divide catalogs into broad categories (for instance office supplies versus parts for your products). Label the shelves with what these categories are, so that you and your coworkers don't have to guess where to put them back.,, Simply mention it to the salesperson the next time you talk to him or her."
"
Decide on the alphabetical system you will use.,
Group items.,
Index your files.,
Order files alphabetically according to their indexed name.,
Label your file folders.,
Document the indexing and filing system.,
File new items properly.,
File items under their significant term.,
Order names by surname.,
Ignore articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.Articles (such as âa,â âan,â and âtheâ), conjunctions (such as âand,â âbut,â and âorâ), and prepositions (such as âfor,â âof,â and âinâ) are generally skipped when indexing and filing alphabetically, since they are not considered significant terms.,
Treat abbreviations as though they were spelled out.When indexing and filing items, you may encounter abbreviations such as âMfg.â (for âManufacturingâ) or âInc.â (for âIncorporated).,
File numerals ordinarily.,
Deal with any special characters.,
Use the general rule ânothing before somethingâ when necessary.,
Distinguish files by more detailed information, when necessary.In rarer cases, alphabetic information is not enough to determine the order of files.,
Publicize exceptions and special rules.Make sure that everyone who uses your files knows about any exceptions to standard guidelines that are factored into your filing system.",How to File Alphabetically," Even something as seemingly straightforward as alphabetical filing offers several options to choose from.It is important that you choose one system and use it consistently.


Letter-by-letter filing considers each letter in each word in the order of appearance, ignoring any spaces between words.
Word-by-word filing orders items based on the first letter of each word in succession.
Unit-by-unit filing takes into account each word, abbreviation, and initial, ordering items according to these. The unit-by-unit system is generally recommended.;
, Once you have all of the items you need to file, decide how you want to group the files. You can choose the dictionary format, in which all files are put in one alphabetical order, regardless of the type of file or the items it contains. You can also use the encyclopedia format, in which items are grouped by type or subject, and then each group is alphabetically arranged.If you have lots of different types of items to file (recipes, tax receipts, letters, etc.), then it can be helpful to use the encyclopedia format. Group the items by type first, then alphabetically order the items in each group. Keep the groups separated using dividers or color coding.

, Indexing is the manner of placing each section of a title in the correct unit.To index items before filing them, you must break down the elements of each itemâs name and create a new alphabetized name, which may differ from the standard name. For example:


Suppose you have the following items to index and file: an article on aardvarks titled âNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarks,â a biography of noted aardvark expert Jane A. Doe, and a promotional brochure for a Detroit Zoo aardvark exhibit.
The biography of Jane A. Doe would be indexed as âDoe, Jane A.,"" since last names come first in filing. It would be filed under the letter âD.â
The article âNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarksâ could be indexed as-is, if you choose dictionary-style grouping. It could be filed under the letter âNâ (for âNocturnalâ), using this grouping.
Alternatively, you could index âNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarksâ as âAardvarks, Nocturnal Feeding of.â This would make sense if you were using an encyclopedia-style grouping, and not just filing items related to aardvarks. The item would then be filed under âA.â
The promotional brochure could be indexed as âAardvarks, exhibits (Detroit Zoo)."" This would make sense if you expect to have several materials on aardvark exhibitsâfor example, you might have another item to be indexed as âAardvarks, exhibits (Toledo Zoo).â
Alternatively, the promotional brochure could be indexed as âDetroit Zoo (Aardvark Exhibit)."" This might make sense if you expect to have several items related to the Detroit Zoo, or if you want to use an encyclopedia-style grouping to file items by geographic location.

, The general rule for filing alphabetically is to arrange items in order from A (first) to Z (last). Use increasingly specific information to distinguish between and order separate items.For instance:


The order of your indexed files in the previous step could then be (depending on the system you use): âDoe, Jane A.,â âDetroit Zoo (Aardvark Exhibit),â and âNocturnal Feeding of Aardvarksâ OR âAardvarks, exhibits (Detroit Zoo),â âAardvarks, Nocturnal Feeding of,â and âDoe, Jane A.â
A file for âWallabyâ would come after a file for âEmu.â A file for âKangarooâ would come in between, and a file for âAardvarkâ would come before one for âBearâ and one for âEmu.â This would give you the following file order: ""Aardvark,"" ""Bear,"" ""Emu,"" ""Kangaroo,"" ""Wallaby.""
If you then added a file for âAnteater,â it would come after any files for âAardvark.â Since both begin with the letter âA,â you have to look at the second letter of each word (âNâ and âA,â respectively) to determine the order, and then arrange files based on this. The new order would be: ""Aardvark,"" ""Anteater,"" ""Bear,"" ""Emu,"" ""Kangaroo,"" ""Wallaby.""

, To make it easy to locate items, label each file folder with the proper indexed name of the item(s) it contains. This will also make it easier to introduce new files in the proper order.


Place items in the folder designated for them.
You may also find it useful to color code your files to improve usability.For instance, if you are using an encyclopedia-style grouping, give each group a separate color, and label each item/file in each group with its respective color.

, Be consistent with your indexing and filing system, whatever it is. Ensure anyone with access to the files is aware of the system. For instance, you can create and share a document that details your filing system rules. This will help everyone be able to use the filing system efficiently., Place files in the cabinet based on the indexed names and alphabetical order, according to the system you use. Shift the current files as needed to place new files in the correct place., Sometimes, it makes sense to file items based on key words, regardless of the order that words in a title or name appear. This ensures that a file can be indexed and located using the most logical term. For instance


âFirst Bank of Chicagoâ could be indexed and filed as âChicago, First Bank of.ââChicagoâ is the key term in this entry, rather than âFirstâ or âBank,â especially if you might have other items with similar names, such as âFirst Bank of Tulsaâ or âChicago Bank and Trust.â

, Typical filing standards recommend indexing individuals by last name first, since the surname is considered the significant term.Thus, âJane A. Doeâ would be indexed and filed as âDoe, Jane A.â
Put titles (Dr., Mrs., Major, etc.) at the end.âDr. Jane A. Doe,â for instance, would be indexed and filed as âDoe, Jane A., Dr.â
Generally, order names as they are spelled, letter-by-letter. For instance, âMacDonaldâ would come before âMcDonald.â Likewise, âDâ,â âLâ,â âLe,â âde,â etc. are considered as part of name, not separate units.For instance, order files âHeinlein,â âLe Guinâ âLâEngle,â and âWolfeâ in that order (and NOT as âLâEngle, âLe Guin,â âHeinlein,â âWolfeâ).
A common exception to these rules about names is when an individualâs name forms part of a business or organization name.In these cases, treat the individualâs name as units within the business name. For instance, âJane A. Doe Pest Controlâ would be filed under âJ,â and NOT indexed as âDoe, Jane A. Pest Control.â

, This is the case even when they form the beginning of an itemâs name. For instance:


âAn Investigation of Emu Feeding Practicesâ would be in filed under âE,â for âEmuâ (the significant word in this itemâs title), rather than âAâ for âan.â
âDoe and Smith Pest Controlâ would be filed after âDoe, Jane A.â Both indexed names begin with the word âDoe,â so you move on to the next significant term in each (âSmithâ and âJane,â respectively) to determine the file order. Ignore the word âand,â since it is not significant.

, Generally, you should index and file items as though these abbreviations were spelled out, rather than simply as strings of letters.


For instance, âJane A. Doe Mining Companyâ would be filed before âJane A. Doe Mfg.â

, While filing items alphabetically, you may encounter numerals within their titles. Generally, file numbers ordinarily, rather than as if they were spelled out. Numbers are also filed before letters.


For instance, â3M Companyâ would be filed before â100 Great Business Ideasâ (since â3â comes before â100â).
âGreat Business Ideasâ and âGreat Business Leadersâ would be filed after â100 Great Business Ideas,â since numbers are arranged before letters.
Numbers that are already spelled out are treated as words, rather than numerals. For instance, file items â100 Great Business Leaders,â âGreat Business Ideas,â and âTwo Hundred Great Business Ideasâ in that order.
If it serves your filing purposes, however, you can make an exception and always file numerals as though they were spelled out., Any non-alphabetical or non-numeric characters that you encounter when indexing and filing items must be taken into account. What to do with these characters, however, depends on their type:


Punctuation (such as apostrophes, periods, and commas) is generally ignored when indexing and filing items.For instance, file âWashingtonâs Best Coffee,â and âWashington State Fairâ in that order.
Diacritics are treated as the corresponding letter, without the diacritic mark.For example, file âÃclairâ as âEclair,â and âÃberâ as âUber.â The exception to this is when you are filing according to the alphabet of a language that uses diacritics, in which case you should follow the normal alphabetical order of that language.

, Generally, spaces (including punctuation and other elements that are skipped) are ignored when filing alphabetically. However, in cases where you have items that begin the same way, use a space or the rule ""nothing before something"" to determine the filing order.


For instance, file âNorth East Bank,â âNortheast Bank,â and âNorth East Manufacturingâ in that order.Likewise, ""Doe, Jane A."" would be filed before ""Doe, Jane A., Dr.""

, In these cases, you must utilize further information to index and order items. Mark this additional information on the respective files to help you distinguish them. For instance:


If you had items for two different individuals named Jane A. Doe, you could order them by birthdate. File âDoe, Jane A. (b. 1853)â would thus come before file âDoe, Jane A. (b. 1967).
You could also order items according to geography when you need to make distinctions. If you have files for three different banks in three different locations, and each bank is called âFirst United Bank and Trust,â you could order them alphabetically in the order âFirst United Bank and Trust (Georgia)â, âFirst United Bank and Trust (Oklahoma),â and âFirst United Bank and Trust (South Dakota).â
Likewise, if you had items for two different bears or types of bears, you would distinguish them further, based on species, geographic location, etc. For instance, you might have files on âBear, Brownâ and âBear, Grizzlyâ (in that order), or files on ""Bears (European)"" and âBears (North American)â (in that order).

, This will help ensure that everyone can use the filing system properly and efficiently.

Replacing your fax is easy!",How to Fax Without Using a Fax Machine3," Consider what comprises the traditional machine: A simple black-and-white scanner, an electronic connection from one location to anotherâaka a phone line, and a thermal printer that even in 1984 was antique technology.

It's like a fax machine on steroids!

,


Avoid discussing your options with too many outside sources. While the input of trusted loved ones could be helpful, asking too many people could also cause you to doubt yourself and not find your passion at work.

,


Your perfect job should be one that helps you reach your life goals and the plans that you have for yourself over the long term.

Use time wisely.,
Take sensible breaks.,
Make the most of your breaks.,
Evaluate your performance in a journal and/or calendar.,
Use external motivation.",How to Excel at Work1," Make work a positive experience by taking a job that you actually want. Increase your motivation to excel by accepting a role whose challenges mirror your own personal ambitions. Whether you are seeking employment at a new organization, looking to transfer from within, or reconsidering your current position, ask yourself the following to determine whether the job at hand is right for you:Do I enjoy the tasks demanded by this position?
Do these tasks play to my strengths?
Would I contribute my best to the company in this position or elsewhere?;
, Resist the temptation to tackle everything with maximum efficiency all at once. Improve your performance bit by bit instead. Sketch a timeline of your workday, listing your duties hour by hour. Select the first one or two and then outline the specific tasks that each one involves. Think of ways that you can improve your performance with each individual task in order to streamline the whole process.As you implement these changes, move on to the next hour. Continue to do so until you have streamlined your whole workday.
If your workdays vary in nature from one day to the next, perform this same practice for each distinctive day.
Once you have streamlined each workday, think bigger. Consider weekly, monthly, or even yearly goals. Work backwards from the end date to see how tweaking this or that daily micro-task might be increase your chances of meeting those goals even further.

, Make the most of your time on the clock.Reduce the risk of burnout and/or mistakes that comes from cramming too much work into too little time in order to compensate for lost opportunities. Prioritize working for sustained periods at a reasonable pace over sneaking in as many breaks as possible and making up for it later. Maintain your output and sanity at the same time.


Arrive early enough so that you can take care of all the little things (settling in, making coffee, using the bathroom) before starting time.
Abstain from distractions like computer games, social media, and personal messaging through phone, text, and/or email.
Use downtime to catch up on backlogs, prep for future tasks, or give yourself a headstart by diving right into them.

, Give yourself a refresher by stepping away from work once every hour. Research has shown that productivity among workers actually increases when they take a 17-minute break for every 52 minutes of work. However, keep in mind that this exact formula may not apply to every single person. Also bear in mind that your employer may enforce a strict policy of how much break-time employees are entitled to.'Recognize the warning signs. If you find it harder and harder to concentrate on the task at hand without woolgathering, take that as a sign to step away.
Use the bathroom or a coffee refill as an excuse to walk away if you arenât permitted to take breaks at your own discretion.

, Wake your mind and body up with physical activity if you sit or stand in place for the majority of your work-time. Or, if your job is physically demanding, take a catnap on your designated break. Also, socialize with other workers as a way to engage your brain with something other than work.Take a walk around the block or parking lot as a way to move. Climb stairs if you are granted access to the buildingâs stairwells. Or do some push-ups, jumping jacks, or other light exercise where you can.
Be careful not to interrupt other coworkers from their own tasks by starting a conversation. Coordinate breaks with your colleagues if possible, or use this time to return personal calls.

, Keep a daily log of your goals for a given day and what you actually achieved. Include any new methods or ideas that helped accomplish these goals or even exceed them. Also include any factors that prevented you from meeting your aims. Add weekly and monthly summaries to track your progress with meeting long-term goals. Use these records to:Mark positive changes to your performance so you can implement them further.
Identify areas that need more focus and improvement.
Anticipate setbacks beyond your control in order to preempt or plan around them if they repeat themselves in the future.

, Whether you are striving for a promotion, raise, or bonus, or if you just happen to be one of many who feel no particular passion for their current job, use your personal goals and responsibilities as motivators. Mark your calendar with outside achievements you hope to meet by this or that date. Adorn your workspace with imagery or symbols that will constantly remind you of what you are working for. Hold yourself accountable to what you do love in life in order to excel.


Mark your calendar with rewards that you aspire to, such as earning a promotion or buying a new car or house.
Also note down due dates for your bills and debts, the amounts you hope to pay each cycle, and your projected date for final payment as motivators.
Hang pictures of your family or even that new car you hope to buy in your workspace.
If thatâs not possible, use another object that visually reminds you of your motivation, like a coffee mug that was a gift from your daughter, or a keychain from that coveted car company.

Consider yourself a permanent student.,
Embrace new challenges.,
Involve yourself in the growth of the organization.,
Set your ego aside.",How to Excel at Work2," As you become more proficient in your field, avoid the temptation to confuse this with a total mastery of anything and everything related to it. Instead, take advantage of every opportunity to learn something new. Embrace every new fact, idea, and method that may improve your work performance.Subscribe to newspapers, magazines, podcasts, blogs, and/or business book clubs that report on your trade or issues that it faces.
Keep up to pace with evolving technology to spot new ways that it could streamline your duties.
Value new workers who can teach something new, even when their position is lower than yours in the organizationâs hierarchy.

, Resist the urge to avoid anything new just because it may seem difficult at first. Appreciate the difference between good stress and bad stress. Regard your brainâs needs as being equivalent to your bodyâs, in that it needs stress in order to grow (the same way you need the physical stress of doing curls in order to build your biceps). Exercise your brain accordingly while expanding your know-how. Expect a rejuvenated feeling of self-confidence and satisfaction upon completion of tough projects.Recognize good stress from bad by the element of control. Stress becomes detrimental when you begin to feel helpless.
Take a step back from your work whenever you feel like you have bitten off more than you can possibly chew. Reappraise the situation and formulate a new strategy if the old one isnât working.
Working in a positive team environment helps reduce bad stress by offering a greater number of fresh perspectives when the going gets rough.

, Donât wait to be handed down directives and mission statements. Take an active role in shaping the organization from within. Present yourself as a key player in its future while demonstrating your investment in its success.Establish regular meeting with your supervisor to discuss ways in which your position and/or department can be improved.
Offer your services for new assignments or projects. Display both your willingness and capabilities while also gaining firsthand knowledge of where the organization is headed.
Volunteer to train new hires and underperforming employees. Prove yourself to be a team player to your supervisors. At the same time, place yourself in a position to spot future potential in recent hires and resolve problems contributing to underperformance.

, Embrace both positive and negative feedback. Reward your efforts by accepting commendations for your accomplishments.At the same time, value critical feedback as being equally vital to your success.Maintain a clear distinction between your potential and your current abilities and performances. Honor your potential by striving to embody it, but keep an honest perspective on how far you have left to go.


Accept supervisorsâ decisions not to move forward on your suggestions. Ask for specific reasons for their decision. Use these to either reformulate your initiatives so they incorporate your supervisorsâ concerns, or devise entirely new plans to meet their expectations.
Embrace failed or lackluster projects as learning experiences. Review your performance to spot potential alternatives you might have taken to achieve a more positive result. Welcome recommendations and constructive criticism from supervisors and coworkers.
Listen to concerns and questions from underperforming workers and new hires. Use their input to identify areas where the organization could improve to ensure better productivity.

Conduct yourself professionally.,
Learn about your organization.,
Anticipate your supervisorâs needs.,
Be a positive role model.",How to Excel at Work3," Some organizations may be more casual in approach than others, but respect the fact that each one is an institution with a stated purpose. Conform to the demeanor expected of employees. Foster a positive impression with your employers and coworkers by:Following dress codes.
Obeying rules and codes of conduct.
Treating others with respect.
Setting personal matters aside while on the job.
Abstaining from office gossip.

, Present yourself as part of the team, rather than an individual who just happens to clock in here for a paycheck. Think of the organization the way you would with a significant other. Learn its wants, needs, and concerns. Demonstrate to your employers and colleagues that you are fully invested in the organizationâs well-being, and thus theirs. Aim to understand the following:The organizationâs main mission.
Its history, present situation, and future goals.
Obstacles that it faces.
Weaknesses to be overcome.
Strengths to be employed.

, Do the obvious and follow their stated expectations of you. At the same time, pay close attention to their own workday. Note the issues they face on a day-to-day basis. In addition to following the basic duties of your position, develop strategies that will anticipate those issues so they can be preempted or at least minimized. Create a symbiotic relationship with your supervisor so you can become indispensable to them.Play to their preferences. Learn how often they expect to be updated on progress. Use whichever means of communication they prefer (email, phone, meetings). Tailor your updates to emphasize information they prioritize.

Volunteer what you know they will ask of you. As your working relationship becomes more routine, use your prior experience to guess what they will need next from you. Offer to do it before they think to ask it, thus demonstrating your initiative and adaptability.

Become the yin to their yang. Identify areas in which your supervisor proves to be consistently weak. Use your own strengths to make up the difference and improve your departmentâs overall performance.

, Create a working environment that people are glad to join instead of eager to leave. Recognize challenges and hardships as they appear and address them as such to maintain credibility, but accentuate the positive to increase optimism. Reinforce your coworkersâ attitudes by:Regularly expressing gratitude for othersâ contributions in a natural, casual manner, thus avoiding the impression that your thanks is staged or forced.
Encouraging sensible breaks from any employees under your supervision, which will demonstrate your concern not only for their productivity, but their well-being, too.
Welcoming new ideas and brainstorming sessions, thereby building your coworkersâ self-confidence and sense of worth.
Trusting others to complete their duties without prodding. When you do check in to establish their progress, emphasize that you are only making sure they have the proper support they need, not checking to see if they are slacking off.

Excuse yourself from the conversation.,
Call for help.,
Set boundaries.,
Be vague.",How to Escape the Office Chatterbox1," Let the chatterbox know that you are busy and have work to do. While this should seem obvious to most people in a work environment, people who are constantly interrupting tend to be attention seekers and procrastinators. You will need to spell it out to the person that you are not available for a chat. Explain that you are preparing for an important meeting, waiting for a phone call or under deadline pressure. It may help to specify a time by saying, âI have to get this memo out by 10:00, letâs catch up another time.â;
, If necessary, pick up the phone and start dialing. If your talkative co-worker attempts to start or continue a conversation, hold up your hand or point to the phone to make it clear that you are making an important call.

, When you feel discomfort, resentment, or guilt about something, it is a clear sign that it is time to set or enforce personal boundaries. There are only so many hours in the workday, and in order to be successful in your career and complete your work, you will need to be assertive in saying no to unnecessary interruptions.Set aside pleasantries, but make sure that you behave professionally. Do not encourage chatter by asking questions or showing interest in what the talkative individual is saying.
Saying no to pushy and aggressive people can be difficult if you tend to be a people pleaser. Start by practicing setting boundaries with your friends and family, and you will gradually become more comfortable drawing a line in the sand with your coworkers. , You can avoid a long, unwanted conversation with someone by being noncommittal and uninteresting. Donât ask too many questions, and keep your responses short. Answer all work-related questions quickly, doing your best to stick to the topic. "
"
Bury yourself in your work.,
Put a headset on.,
Glance at your watch frequently.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Escape the Office Chatterbox2," By keeping piles of papers stacked on your desk, multiple spreadsheets and emails open on your computer, and a mile-long to-do list clearly visible in your workspace, you can create a aura of busyness that might help discourage would-be interruptions.


Continue working and do not make eye contact. Keeping your eyes fixed on your computer monitor, continue to read, open mail, or type when the chatterbox approaches your desk. She may notice that you are busy working and quietly walk away.

, In modern offices that may no longer have doors or even cubical walls to give workers any sense of privacy, headphones may be the only remaining way to create any sense of solitude in the office. The chatterbox will not know whether you have the headphones turned on or off, and this may discourage visits and conversation.


If you choose to turn the headphones on, listening to relaxing music may help you better concentrate in a noisy office as well as escape the unwanted exchange.
If the chatterbox doesnât take the hint and talks to you anyway, take off the headphones and act surprised at the interruption, as if you were actively listening to something important., The gesture should communicate that you have to somewhere important to be, or that you are acutely aware of the time. It may also help to set an alarm on your watch or phone at a time that the chatterbox usually interrupts you, such as right before lunch.


If the person still doesnât take the hint, you can say âIâm sorry, but Iâm running late for an appointment.â or âOh is it already 2:30? I need to catch up on some work.â, If nothing else seems to be working, try standing up at your workstation, so that the person interrupting you is suddenly at eye level rather than standing above you. This sudden switch may make the person uncomfortable, and will send a signal to them that the conversation is over. "
"
Walk quickly through the office.,
Run to the restroom.,
Eat a snack.,
Enlist help from another coworker.,
Take a break.",How to Escape the Office Chatterbox3," Most colleagues will not stop you if you appear to be on a mission or in a hurry to get somewhere. If you are intercepted, try saying; âdo you know which conference room the meeting is in?â

, Get out of chatting by saying that you are on your way for a quick bathroom break. Hopefully no one will be so rude as to question you on that!

, Let the chatterbox know that you are heading to the break room for a quick cup of coffee, tea or a snack anytime she catches you off guard in the hallway. If she insists on joining you in the break room, you can chat for as long as it takes to prepare your cup of coffee, and then say âI really must get back to it.â

, Look for a colleague and immediately tell the chatterer that you have to speak with that person about an urgent matter. If no one else is around, you can say âhave you seen Jim? I need to meet with him about this project thatâs due within the hourâ, and then purposefully rush off toward Jimâs office.

, If the office magpie is keeping you from getting any work done, stop stressing out about it and give yourself a break. Tell your coworker that you have to be somewhere important at a certain time. Thereâs no need to explain that you are simply going for a walk, just hurry out the door, and donât return to your desk until the coast is clear.

"
"
Delegate a task to the chatterbox.,
Flatter the chatterer.,
Discuss the problem with your manager.,
Arrive at work early.",How to Escape the Office Chatterbox4," Since the person seems to have so much extra time on their hands, take advantage of the situation, and request their expertise on a project that youâve been putting off. Once the bothersome person realizes that you are going to assign extra responsibilities to him anytime he talks to you, he will more than likely find another person to pester. Or, you may be able to convince him to help you with a task. Either way, itâs a win for you! , Itâs true that you can catch more flies with honey. Try telling the person interrupting you that youâre so glad they stopped by because you have a work problem for which youâre having trouble finding a solution. Tell them that you value their skills, and are confident that they can solve the problem for you. Then, hopefully they will hurry off to prove you right!

, After doing your best to handle the matter yourself, be discreet and act professionally when speaking with your boss about the problem. You may not be the first to come to your boss about the personâs behavior, and he needs to know about anything that is negatively affecting your productivity. Consider mentioning to your boss that the chatty person seems to have some extra time on their hands, and recommending them for a specific project. That way, the next time the chatterbox bothers you, you can ask them how the project is going and emphasize that it must be keeping them very busy.

, By being the first person to arrive in the morning, you can gain precious quiet time without any interruptions. Your boss might notice your commitment to your work, and reward your productivity with a raise or promotion. The office chatterbox wonât seem like as much of a bother when you know you are already on track to meet your deadline. Staying late at work after everyone else leaves might also be a good option to boost your productivity without being interrupted by coworkers.

The application process varies according to position, so you should research your options on the TfL website.
Apprenticed youth (ages 16 - 18) may also be accepted into training as a train operator for the TfL.More information can be found in the ""Getting an Apprenticeship"" portion of this article.;
, This might require some research on your part, as not all jobs with the TfL may be suitable for you and your goals. Once you gain a job with the TfL, you will be able to apply as a train operator.


Some researchers have found that it is an effective strategy to first get a job with the TfL as a Customer Service Assistant and then apply for train operator when the position becomes available., Due to the cyclic nature of the hiring process, you may have to wait some time before the TfL begins hiring for the position you desire. If you apply for your position and are not contacted to continue the hiring process, don't give up hope! You should:


Research desired traits of the position you apply for.
Take related certification and safety courses.
Volunteer in positions similar to the one you are pursuing to show your competence.

, The approximate number of new train operators, per year, is about 150.This means there will likely be considerable competition for the position. For you to stand the best chance possible, you'll need to take the application process seriously.

, This is a trait that is especially important while applying to be a train operator. After the application process, which can take a considerable time itself, training to be a train operator can take up to six months before you are ready to do the job on your own., The temptation of a great salary, higher than average vacation days, privacy, and a shorter than average work week can make it easy to gloss over the difficult points of this position. As a train operator, you'll need to be able to bear:


Long stretches of time on your own.
Extreme hot and cold conditions.
Small, dark spaces.
Repetitive, accuracy dependent work., Once it is finished, you can send it to the address listed on the form or, if directed by your superior to do so, return the form to him or the colleague he indicates.


The length of time it takes for the TfL to process the initial application response can be quite long., This test is timed for 30 minutes and is intended to evaluate your potential ability as a train operator.Prior to your test, you should look over any provided materials. The TfL gives sample questions for the purpose of preparing for this test.
As the TfL is constantly improving its training procedures, there may be additional assessments required of you at the time of your test.

, These sections serve to measure:


Psychological stability
On-the-job aptitude
Personality evaluation, The English portion of the assessment centre test is aimed at determining how skillfully receive and express information in written word. Spelling, clarity, and accuracy should be made a priority during this portion of the test., As an operator of a train in the London underground, you'll have to use the Public Address (PA) system on your train to communicate with its passengers. Due to the fact that many PA systems are less than adequate, clear speaking is particularly important. You will be tested on your PA skills by:


Receiving practice information to relay to passengers.
Writing out your announcement as you intend on making it.
Recording it into an audio tape., Levers, pulleys, and ramps might not seem like something you need to review, but the assessment centre test will also evaluate your mechanical comprehension. This will involve you looking at mechanical diagrams and then predicting the result of the mechanism in question. The second part of the mechanical portion of the test will require you to evaluate systems that affect each other.You will have to find all errors in these that might cause the system to breakdown.

, The final leg of your assessment centre testing will likely involve two computer tests intended to gauge your abilities of concentration and reflex. The concentration activity involves picking out specified groupings of dots within a time limit, and the reflex test utilizes external prompts, like lights and sounds, which you will respond to with a special keyboard.To improve these two areas, you may want to:


Run through woodlands
Play dodgeball
Play reaction based video games
Play puzzle/response based games, This is the final step assessing your competence as a potential train operator for the London underground. During this test, TfL staff will ask you questions pertaining to the job and you will be expected to answer to the best of your ability. These questions may also include inquiry about:


Why you want to be a train operator.
How you would respond in a certain situation.
Line/depot suitability., The training process for becoming a train operator for the tube can take anywhere from 6 - 12 months depending on individual factors.Once your training is complete, you will begin working on your own as a train operator. Generally, over the course of your training, you will:


Receive an introduction to general information about the London underground.
Familiarize yourself with Operational Procedures Training.
Tour the depot and examine roster/duty sheet information.
Learn about basic train knowledge., Though union agreements make it all but impossible for a non-union member to get a job as a train operator for the tube, a loophole in the agreements does allow for apprenticeships.The general requirements to become an apprentice include:


Being between 16 and 18 years of age.
Having no less than four GCSEs
Physical ability, Though well salaried and seemingly straightforward, the job of a train operator has many difficult points as well. If you are uncomfortable in confined spaces for long periods of time, dislike the dark or early/late shifts, are sensitive to extreme weather conditions, or find concentrating on repetitive tasks difficult, a job as a train operator for the tube might not be for you., The hiring process usually follows a predictable pattern, which enables organizations like TfL to schedule application submissions. The next open enrollment for apprenticeships begins January 7, 2016.For more information or to read the 2016 apprenticeship brochure, visit:


https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/careers/apprenticeships

, Once you have been accepted into the apprenticeship program, you'll be allowed to continue in the evaluation portion of the assessment process.This may be similar to the assessments given to regular workers of TfL who are applying to become a train operator, and may include:


Multiple choice tests
English testing
Enunciation testing
Mechanical knowledge testing
Concentration tests

Speak with current and former train conductors.,
Understand what the job entails.,
Understand the costs and the benefits.,
Understand the track ahead.,
Prepare a resume.,
Apply for the job.,
Attend a hiring event and do well on the employment test.,
Ace the interview.,
Pass the medical exam, the drug screen, and the background check.,
Ask the hiring managers at your new railroad company about the job training procedure.,
Patiently complete any on-the-job training.,
Take it seriously.",How to Become a Train Conductor," Ask a lot of questions about the job, and try to decide whether it's right for you.


Ask about the pay, the hours, the co-workers, the passengers. Ask about the skills you'll need and the skills that you'll develop. Ask how conductors balance their job with their social lives. Ask what it's like to work for specific rail companies. Ask how conductors got to where they are today.
If you ride a train, try to take the opportunity to speak to the conductor. Say, ""Do you have a minute? I'm interested in becoming a conductor myself, and I was wondering if you had any tips.""
Read online forums about the train industry, and read the personal accounts of past and present conductors. Don't be afraid to reach out to conductors for more information--even if you're just asking questions through a forum. You may find that many veteran conductors are happy to share their expertise with you.;
, Train conductors are responsible for the train, the freight, the passengers, and the crew. If you're working on a passenger train, daily tasks will include:


Checking that the carriages are clean before the start of a journey;
Making sure equipment, doors, and controls are working properly;
Walking through carriages during the journey, checking tickets and travel documents;
Answering passengers' questions about routes, arrival times and connections;
Making announcements over the public address system;
Making sure passengers get on and off the train safely;
Dealing with unexpected delays or emergencies--for example, a passenger falling ill;
Writing reports detailing any delays or incidents that occur during each journey., You'll get to travel extensively, as a conductor, and you'll make a solid living--but the train life can be lonely, and your family life may suffer if you need to spend days at a time away from home.


You can make more than $80,000 a year working as a train conductor--nearly $39/hour. In May 2011, the lowest-paid train conductors were making below $39,120, or $18.84/hour. The average industry salary was $56,570 per year, roughly $27.20/hour.
Rail companies tend to provide excellent benefits and retirement packages.
You'll get to travel the country and see a new place every day--and get paid to do it. You'll learn the ins and outs of the train industry. You'll get to spend a majority of your days riding trains around.
If you're working as a conductor on a passenger train, you'll interact with passengers on a daily basis, assuring their safety and meeting their needs. If you work on a freight train, you'll be primarily dealing with the driver, the yard workers, and the freight itself; if you're the type of person that needs to be around people all the time, you may grow lonely from freight life.

, If you don't have any prior experience in the transport industry, you will likely need to start out working on the train crew as a switch-person or a brake person.SwitchÂ  people and brake people work for rail lines as on-the-ground traffic control. These are entry-level positions: you can get a job with Union Pacific, for instance, without any prior railway experience.
As a train crew member, you'll be assigned to a specific hub--a major city--and this will determine the geographic region in which you work. You may be required to travel, and you may be assigned work at any location within that geographic hub.
Switch person and brake-person positions directly lead to becoming a conductor or a locomotive engineer (train driver). If you're serious about the industry, consider taking a job in a rail yard and working your way up to a conductor position.
In the train industry, many assignments are given in accordance with seniority. Work hard, be patient, and make connections.
If you do apply directly to a conductor position, and you are qualified, most rail companies will pay to train you for the job.If you're at the top tier of applicants, depending on the rail company, you may be able to become a train conductor within as little as three months., You'll need a strong resume to apply to a railway company, and experience in the transportation industry will work in your favor.


Be honest about your qualifications. Make sure that your past employment information, criminal history, and driving history are as accurate as possible. Train conductors must pass a mandatory background check; count on the check to uncover any skeletons in your closet, provided that they're on your public record.
Your resume and cover letter should demonstrate that you are responsible, accountable, and able to work well under pressure.
The only requirements are a high school diploma (or GED equivalent) and 2-3 years of general work experience (or college). However, your resume will look much stronger if you have worked in the transportation or safety industries; experience as a bus driver, tram driver, or ferry pilot will especially qualify you.
Any experience with operations--in the transport industry, the food industry, retail, etc.-- will work in your favor.

, Search for job openings--you can search through third-party job-placement websites, or you can inquire directly with specific railroads. Bear in mind that unless you have past experience, you may need to get in on the ground level as a yard worker or a train crew member.


Most of the major railroads in the United States are constantly hiring conductors. The job market for train conductors is expected to expand by 5% by 2020, driven largely by population growth and global trade along with a flux of aging, retiring conductors. In the U.S., however, a lack of new railway construction stunts the growth of the industry.
Apply for as many positions as you can. If you want to work in a particular region, apply to railroads that run through that region. Check a company's website for information about where the lines run.
Keep in mind that safety plays an enormous role in the duties of a train conductor. Again, prior experience as a bus driver or a tram driver will work strongly in your favor.

, If you meet the qualifications for a specific railroad, the company will invite you to a hiring event, where you will take a pre-employment test.


The test typically includes reading comprehension and simple mechanical problems. Even if you're proficient in these skills, it never hurts to brush up before an important test.

Dress as you would for any professional job interview. Men, wear a button-down and a tie. Women, wear a work-appropriate dress or pantsuit.

, If you do well on the hiring test, you'll be interviewed individually. If you ace your interview, you will receive a conditional job offer.


At the interview, be polite, composed, and professional. Display that you are good with people and that you can remain calm under pressure. If you have any prior transportation experience--such as working as a bus driver--this is the time to talk it up.
If you receive a conditional job offer, then congratulations: you're almost hired! You will need to pass a medical exam and a background check. The medical exam includes a drug test, so aspiring Casey Jones's should ""watch their speed"" during the application process. In the transportation industry, more-so than most industries, it's important that employees are clear-headed, responsible, and able to respond quickly to emergencies.

, If you do, you will receive a job offer.


Congratulations! You will now attend train conductor school at your railroad's training facility, and you will be starting your new career.

,


Some train companies require new conductors to complete a 5-6 week training program--often offered through a community college or technical school. These programs often lead to a certificate in railroad conductor technology. Courses in the program usually cover the rules of operation, safety, signals, rail equipment, and train conductor duties.For the most part, hands-on experience in the railroad industry is considered to be the strongest preparation for a conductor job.

,


Once you've been hired, trained, and assigned to a location or ""hub"", many rail companies will require that you undergo 8-22 weeks of additional on-the-job training at your assigned location.If you do well, the on-the-job ""training"" period may end much sooner than is possible--so listen, learn, and try to absorb as much information as you can about the industry.

, If you wind up working full-time as a train conductor, you may be responsible for the safety and comfort of hundreds of passengers each day. You may responsible for thousands--or millions--of dollars worth of cargo.


Be responsible and be accountable. Show up for work when you're called, even though the hours may be haphazard; refrain from substance use, and make sure that you get plenty of sleep. Treat the job as an honor, not just a way to pay the bills.
Respect your passengers. Times may come when you must be stern; you may even need to throw someone off of a train if they don't have a ticket or they're causing a ruckus. However, if you're working on a passenger train, you'll work closely with these people day in and day out--so be upbeat, be polite, and be patient.
Respect your elders. Many railroad employees have been working the lines for decades. It will do you well to listen and learn from those who have been in the industry longer than you.

Execute the fax broadcasting transmission.",How to Do Fax Broadcasting," Make sure that the network and server that will house the software has the resources necessary to support all the essential functions. If in doubt, consult with an information technology professional before making the purchase.;
, Depending on the features of the purchased software, it may be possible to pull fax numbers from sales databases, customer information found in a billing system or purchased marketing and sales lists. Since most fax software programs are configured to use spreadsheet programs as a source for the fax numbers, you may be able to either manually enter the data onto a spreadsheet or import the information from various sources to create your master source.

, Base the lists on whatever criterion is appropriate for your company. One list may be for prospective clients only, while a different list focuses on current customers. You can even create specific sub-lists that focus on specific demographics such as location or industry type. This makes it possible to use your lists for a general fax advertising campaign or one that is targeted to a specific audience.

, The idea is to make sure the document received by everyone on the list is structured to be easy to read and provides all essential information on as few pages as possible.

, During the process, double check to make sure the right list is selected by quickly reading through the names of the intended recipients.

, Most programs will process larger lists in batches, systematically rotating through the entire list while flagging numbers that are busy or that do not pick up. Those numbers are usually tried again 2 to 3 times before being returned as undeliverable. At the end of the transmission process, the software will provide a detailed status report to show both the successful transmissions and those that failed.

Check to be sure you qualify.,
Train to be a taxi driver.,
Pass any required tests.,
Acquire the necessary paperwork.,
Pay any required fees and receive your certification or license to drive a taxi.",How to Be a Taxi Driver1," All cities have a set of requirements to drive a taxi, and you should check them to be sure you qualify. Typical requirements for drivers include:A driverâs license
Minimum Age â In most cities taxi drivers must be at least 21, though in some they can be as young as 18.
Good Health â Drivers often have to pass a health exam to assure they have no conditions that would endanger passengers.
No Convictions â Drivers must typically have no felony convictions and not be serving parole.
No Tickets â Drivers must typically have no unpaid tickets in order to get certified.;
, There is typically no formal educational requirement to be a taxi driver â i.e. you donât need a high school diploma â but many cities require some brief training. The specifics will vary from city to city. This training usually lasts from a day to several weeks, and covers local traffic laws, driver safety, street layout, communication equipment, and taxi meter operation. Taxi companies will usually train new hires for free, or you can seek training at a local community college or specialized taxi school.Some municipalities that require training by law include:


New York â Taxi drivers must take a 6 hour defensive driving course and complete either a 24 or 80 hour taxi school course.The longer course might well be worth it, as only 53% of test takers pass the license test.Chicago â You must attend a 3 week course at the Public Chauffeur Training Institute.San Francisco â You must attend an accredited taxi school and obtain a Taxi Training Certificate and Sensitivity Training Certificate.
Paris â You must have obtained a level 1 first aid certificate, or DiplÃ´me PSC1 (prÃ©vention et secours civiques de niveau 1)., Most municipalities, even if they do not have required training, do have a required test. Applicants are often charged a fee to take these tests. They vary in difficulty from âThe Knowledge,â the London cab driver test that typically requires 2-4 years of study,to less daunting exams like the Washington, DC taxi driver test. If there is no training course, then the city will typically provide a study guide to help applicants prepare for the test. Tests cover topics such as:


Routes
Landmarks
Boundaries
Cab requirements
Business practices
Non-discrimination
Customer service

, In addition to knowledge tests, most cities will require you to submit an application, furnish documents and undergo background checks to ensure that you have the right to work, a clean driving record and no criminal background. Typical requirements include:A valid driverâs license
A social security card
Immigrant documentation if applicable
Driving record
A criminal background check (for which you may need to supply fingerprints)
A medical examination
Drug test

, The fees for licensing typically range from $40 in less lucrative markets to upwards of $300 in big cities. Fees are sometimes waived if a city is experiencing a shortage of cab drivers.

Determine your capability to succeed.,
Establish a method of training that works best for you.,
Research technical schools in your area.,
Start applying for work.,
Advance your training.",How to Become a Car Audio Installer," The workload is typically very demanding and you should be in good physical condition. Car audio installers are prone to vigorous activities such as kneeling and stooping in tight spaces for extended periods. Stamina and dexterity are essential. You should also be fairly comfortable with tools and mechanical equipment. Having prior knowledge of basic wiring or electrical components is helpful.;
, In addition to physical agility, learning how to become a car audio installer also requires critical thinking skills. These skills can be self taught through the use of training manuals or instructional videos, but attending a mobile electronics technical school is highly recommended. Most retail audio facilities prefer accredited installers.

, There are many mobile electronics schools operating across the country that have flexible schedules and hands on programs. The programs range from basic to highly specialized, depending on the money and time you're capable of investing.


Contact the enrollment department. Ask pertinent questions, including the cost of tuition, and for assistance with information on financial aid. If required, be prepared to show your previous education, a high school diploma or GED, for example.
Find out how long training takes to complete. Some programs may last a few weeks, while higher accreditation takes much longer. Secure financing, prepare your schedule, and enroll in a reputable mobile audio school.
Even after learning how to become a car audio installer, you'll need to take an exam to complete the certification process. The Mobile Electronics Certified Professional (or MECP) certification is offered through the Consumer Electronics Association, which has trained tens of thousand of technicians. A minimum score of 70 percent is required to pass any MECP exam.

, Mobile electronics schools often assist with job placement, which is another good reason to enroll. Equipped with the mobile electronics certification, you're ready to face the challenge of a competitive job market. Once you're hired, stay aware of new developments in equipment and techniques to remain viable.

, Besides the basic apprentice level of MECP certification, there are 3 additional levels: Advanced Installation Technician, Master Installation Technician, and Mobile Product Specialist. The latter is for sales professionals. On the job experience and additional training could result in a higher income and more stability.

Once hired, pay close attention during training.",How to Become a Launch Driver or Water Taxi Captain," A launch driver is responsible for the operation of a launch boat, usually a 24â30 foot (7.3â9.1Â m) open-top, diesel-powered vessel. The launch driver handles the operation and maintenance of the vessel, in addition to providing passengers with friendly service and useful information. Duties include:


Starting up the boat at the beginning of the day, making sure to check routine fluids including:

The level and condition of the engine oil (should be at the proper level as indicated on the dipstick and not too dirty).
The level of the coolant (should be visible when the cap is removed) (warning: never check coolant after running the engine, because hot coolant could spray out under pressure, causing injury).
The condition of the transmission fluid (should be dark red and translucent â if it is white and milky, salt has penetrated the transmission housing and must be flushed out before the transmission is engaged).
The amount of fuel in the tank â you donât want to run out while untied in open water!


Tying the launch boat off while picking passengers up at the dock/pier.
Greeting the passengers warmly as they enter the boat and providing up-to-date weather information and harbor information.
Assisting passengers with stowing additional gear aboard the boat if they require help.
Navigating the waterways safely and in accordance with local navigational rules.
Planning and executing an efficient drop-off and pickup route around the harbor.
Approaching and landing safely on customersâ boats.
Helping boaters who need battery jump starts, boat tows, and mooring assistance.;
, In many ways, working as launch driver is a great occupation. Passing workdays under the sun and on the open water is relaxing and fun. Often, launch drivers receive benefits such as free boat services at the boat yard or yacht club they work for, discounts on marine products, and flexible schedules. Some launch drivers are fortunate enough to work where tipping is the norm and may make a handsome amount of money in cash.

, On the other hand, the job can include long hours, physically demanding days, and periods of high stress. Working outdoors may sound nice at first, but after twelve hours it can be quite taxing. Additionally, it is often the sole responsibility of the driver(s) on duty to remember on the go which customers have radioed requesting pickups, while simultaneously completing pickups already on their route. This can lead to stress, as sometimes a pickup can slip your mind and anger a waiting customer.

, Being a launch driver requires one to have organizational, logistical, and interpersonal skills.


You must be independent. Being a launch driver requires the confidence to take responsibility for the safety of passengers and respond to variable situations at a momentâs notice.
You must be friendly. Although your main duty is to pilot the boat, it is important to remember to interact with the passengers and make them feel at ease.
You must be responsible. Navigating varying weather, changing tides, and moving boats requires a risk-averse and conservative attitude.

, Be at least seventeen years of age (eighteen to carry more than seven passengers), an English speaker, and a US citizen. It also helps to be familiar with the basics of boat operation.

,, Sea service hours prove to the Coast Guard that the applicant is familiar with local waters, weather conditions, and traffic patterns. Log these hours on form CG-719S (Sea Service).


For a USCG Limited Masters license (allows seven or more passengers aboard), 120 days (4+ hours per day) of self-documented sea time with 90 days in the last year are required.
For a USCG Limited OUPV license (no more than six passengers aboard), 90 days (4+ hours per day) of self-documented sea time with 90 days in the last year are required.

, The physical makes sure that you are able to perform the duties related to maritime work. It is very similar to a regular doctorâs office physical, but focuses more heavily on vision. Colorblindness, for example, is a disqualifying factor because most maritime markers and buoys are red or green. Have the physician fill out form CG-719K (Physical).


Occupational centers such as Concentra are often fast and easy places to have a pre-employment physical done.

, You must be able to pass a DOT-5 drug panel that tests for marijuana, cocaine, and opiates, among others. The results should be logged on form CG-719P (Drug Testing).

, As the captain of the boat, you must be able to address basic medical situations if a passenger is injured.

, You must complete this class ensuring that you are knowledgeable regarding basic navigation, operation, and boat safety.

, After you pass the exam, you will be given certificate which you will include in your application packet.

, A TWIC is a TSA license. To obtain one, you must visit an enrollment center, be photographed, provide biometric information, get a background check, and pay a fee.

, The completed application should consist of forms CG-719B (Application), CG-719K (Physical), CG-719KE (Entry Level), CG-719P (Drug Testing), and CG-719S (Sea Service). Send them all to your local USCG office.


If your application is approved, you will receive a Merchant Mariner Credential that will allow you to start work as launch driver! Links for some of the aforementioned steps can be found at the bottom of the article.


, Launch driving, and maritime work in general, consists of a very close-knit community. Chances are, if you live in a coastal community, you may know someone who was or is a launch driver. Ask them to recommend you to their employer. This personal introduction can work wonders for quick employment.

, Look for opportunities to meet and interact with maritime professionals, recreational boaters, and dock-hands. These folks are always around the waterfront and will often be aware of job opportunities for the aspiring launch driver.

, Since most launch driving positions are provided by private companies, ask businesses that have established launch services if they have openings.


It is often best to ask about available positions during the off-season, because that is when many of the previous season's drivers leave to work elsewhere.

, Launch driving is a very niche profession. Since there are not many people qualified to drive launch boats, managers and business owners are often hard-pressed to find suitable employees. Approaching a business owner directly can seem daunting, but is often the quickest way to be hired as a launch driver.

, Master the basics of boat operation, maintenance, and customer service during the training period. You will often work without direct supervision as a launch driver. This means that you will need to prove to your employer that you can handle the demands of the job without constant guidance.

Decide if you will own your own cab or contract to work for a taxi company.,
Consider the costs of being an independent driver.,
Get hired by a taxi company as a cheaper alternative.,
Drive your own car for a service like Uber.",How to Be a Taxi Driver2," Drivers who own their cabs take 100% of the fares received, but also have a host of expenses, from the cost of the cab to insurance to licensing. Employees of taxi companies either receive a percentage of fares (typically about a third) or rent the cab daily or weekly and pay all fuel costs., Depending on the city or state where you are driving, getting started with your own cab can cost anywhere from about $5,000 â mostly the cost of the cab â to nearly a million dollars. Yes, one million. In big cities where the number of licensed taxis is limited, the cost of obtaining a license is often outrageous â $872,000 on average in New York, $560,000 in Boston, $300,000 in Chicago,and $325,000 in Parisâ leaving new drivers little choice but to work for established companies. Overall costs include:The cab â Cars frequently used as cabs include Ford Crown Victorias, Dodge Caravans or Nissan Quests, Ford Escape Hybrids, and Toyota Priuses.They cost anywhere from about $3,000 used to over $30,000 new.Insurance â The requirements for taxi insurance are much higher than for private use of your car â between $5,000-$10,000 a year.Taxi meter â Around $180 used.
A top light - Cost from $150 for a basic roof topper up to $1300 for a video topper.
Car markings â You will need to put your business name and phone number on the side of your taxi. Decals start at $10-$25 per square foot., Working for a company means you will make less money per client, but it also comes without the prohibitive start-up costs. In addition, having a dispatcher can help you to get more fares. There are two ways that contract drivers get paid:Percentage â The company pays all costs, including gas, and you take home about 30% of each fare. In Boston, drivers average about $200 gross per day, meaning they would take home only $60. In New York the average is closer to $250 for a take of $75 per day.Leasing â The driver leases the cab and pays for gas, but takes home all fares. Renting a cab costs around $100 per day, with fuel costs of about $20, meaning take home pay of around $80 to $130 per day.

, Drivers for these for-hire services are not taxi drivers and do not have to complete the same driver licensing or pay for a taxi license, resulting in higher per hour earnings. Uber charges passengers $.18 a minute plus $1 per mile, with a multiplier during times of higher demand, and drivers keep 80% of the fare. The only requirements are:A license
Age 21 or older
A car model year 2000 or newer (2005 in some cities)
Background check

"

Drive safely.,
Protect yourself.,
Know where to get fares.,
Pass out business cards.,
Know the town.,
Provide quality customer service.",How to Be a Taxi Driver3," Avoiding accidents is your number one priority as a cab driver, because accidents endanger you and your passengers and cost you money.Follow all traffic laws.
Do not speed.
Take care when changing lanes. Do not weave through traffic.
Do not drive when tired or otherwise impaired.
Immediately report any accidents.

, Accidents are not the only danger a cabbie faces. There are also your passengers. Taxi drivers carry cash and operate alone, often late at night, making them vulnerable to assault. To protect yourself:Radio the dispatcher whenever picking up a client.
Keep your windows rolled up and doors locked between fares.
Be wary of passengers that give vague instructions.
Do not let single passengers sit directly behind you. Use an excuse â company policy or car balance â and politely ask them to move.
Do not drive into back alleys.
Do not resist robberies. Instead, memorize the suspectâs description and contact the police as soon as possible.

, Driving a taxi is a bit like fishing: you need to know where to get bites. When first starting out, experiment with different locations at different times until you find the right mix. Some places to consider include:


Airports in the mid morning
Business districts during lunch
Suburban rail or subway stops during rush hour
Out of the way restaurants during the evening
Clubs late at night

, If you're an independent taxi driver, you'll have to work long hours in order to pay for the lease on the car and make enough money for your salary. Giving out cards can boost your business by creating repeat customers.

, Yes, navigation systems allow anybody to get from point A to B, but really good taxi drivers know not only how to get where they are going, but the fasted routes for any time of day. More than that, they are able to offer recommendations on dining, lodgings, and nightlife.

, The difference between getting 5% and 10% on a tip can be huge. The better service you provide, the more money you will make. To give your passengers the best service possible:Keep your car clean.
Always call passengers 30 minutes prior to pick-up if they have pre-booked. This will keep them from worrying about whether you will show up.
Have snacks on hand for airport passengers. A bottle of water and a granola bar will be greatly appreciated by hungry passengers.
Do not talk on the phone while driving passengers. It makes you a less safe driver, and it leaves you unavailable to answer questions.
Stay calm. Do not curse at other drivers or traffic.
Be courteous and thankful. âGood morning,â âgood afternoon,â or âgood eveningâ are a must when your passenger enters the car. Always thank your passenger when he or she leaves.

It is illegal to pick up riders who have not requested a ride through the Uber app.

, This will switch the app to your rider's destination. Make sure to confirm the destination with the rider in case they entered it incorrectly or want to go somewhere else.

, Try to take the quickest route if you know it, or tap the Navigate button for turn-by-turn directions. Quicker trips will result in better ratings.

, This will end the trip and send the fare to the rider's Uber app.

, Your rider will be rating you and you will be rating your rider. It's recommended to give 5 stars unless you encountered significant problems. Tap Complete Rating after selecting the rating you want to give.

, The best way to ensure that you get consistent good rating is to make sure your car is clean and presentable. Since you'll be driving a lot of passengers, this means you'll need to clean your car out more often than your normally would.


On a similar note, make sure you're dressed well and are hygenic. If you're looking shabby, you'll get lower rider ratings.

, You'll ensure that you're always getting ride requests if you accept promptly every time. When you're Online with Uber, you should consider yourself always working. Not accepting requests in a timely manner will result in less requests coming your way.

, After accepting a ride, it's very important that you get there quickly. Your rider will see an ETA after requesting a ride, and will often plan around that.

, If you're always looking at the navigation menu, you'll end up with slower trips. Taking the quickest route is essential for 5-star ratings. It will be helpful to know the routes to take when traffic is bad, or where the most fares will be located.

, You'll need a properly-functioning vehicle to keep driving with Uber. Make sure you keep up with regular maintenance and cleaning. You must have working seatbelts for every rider.

, Follow all traffic laws when driving passengers (and in general, as getting a ticket while off the clock can still result in losing Uber driving privileges). Avoid hard braking or strong acceleration, as it can make your passengers feel unsafe.

, Going the extra mile can help ensure that you get consistent 5-star ratings. Offer bottled water, carry around extra chargers, offer to listen to the rider's preferred music, and help lift bags and open doors. All of this will lead to a 5-star rating from your rider.

, These are areas that are experiencing high-volume rider requests. Picking up riders from a red zone will earn you more money due to the surge pricing.

Be a citizen of a country with a space agency capable of sending humans to space.,
Be the right age.,
Be the right height.,
Pass the physical with flying colors.,
Speak English.,
Learn how to swim and swim well.",How to Become an Astronaut1," Even if your country does have a space agency, you may be relegated to groundwork and not navigating the skies like you'd prefer. While plenty of countries are getting into the space race in one form or another, Russia, China, EU and the USA are the front runners.The ESA (European Space Agency) collaborates with other agencies to send its astronauts aboard their rockets. Currently, the ESA is made up of twenty countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.NASA has had, in the past, astronauts from countries with which they have an international agreement. Namely, Canada, Japan, Russia, and Brazil. For the record, each of these countries does have a space agency.;
, If you're fresh out of recess or fresh out of the senior citizen's discount buffet, you're not astronaut material. The ESA is looking for candidates who are between 27 and 37 years old.NASA is a bit less stringent; there are no age restrictions, but past astronauts have fallen between the ages of 26 and 46. The average age is 34.

, Fingers crossed for that growth spurt! The ESA accepts candidates who are between 153 and 190 centimeters (that's 5' to 6'2 1/2"" for the non-metric folk).Not too tough, eh?


As for NASA, they're looking for men and women between 5'2"" and 6'3"" (157 to 190.5 cm). Six of one, half a dozen of another, really.

, In order to become an astronaut for NASA, your near and far vision must be correctable to 20/20 in each eye. Yep, getting LASIK is okay. As for your physical health, your blood pressure must not be above 140/90 when in a sitting position.


Note that if you make it past the first rounds of testing, addition visual screening will be performed. To pass this round, your distant vision refractive error must be ""between +5.50 and -5.50 diopters in any meridian"" if you do not have a piloting background and ""between +2.50 and -4.00 diopters in any meridian"" if you do have a piloting background. Also notable is the fact that you may not have an astigmatism that requires more than 3.00 diopters of cylinder correction if you're without a piloting background (no more than 2.00 diopters of cylinder correction if you do have one) or an anisometropia larger than 3.5 diopters (2.5 if you have a piloting background).
The ESA has similar requirements. They also stress the need to be psychologically sound. After all, other people are going to be locked in a small room with you for months on end. If you're aggressive, close-minded, or stubborn, you may not be deemed fit for travel., It's not called the International Space Station for nothin'. Fact of the matter is, most people speak it, and you should, too if you plan on working with people of practically every nationality.


Speaking Russian is a helpful tool, too. Second to English, there is a heavy Russian influence when it comes to space relations. Both NASA and the ESA highly value candidates that are fluent in both languages., Because of that pesky phenomenon known as gravity, day-to-day air living isn't great for simulating the likes of the universe. Some of your training will be done underwater. If you can't swim, you probably won't make the cut.


NASA will put you through military water survival training and make sure you can tread water for 10 minutes in addition to swimming 75 meters (246.1Â ft) in a flight suit and being SCUBA-qualified.So sign up for a pass at your local pool now.

Talk to HR if your manager sends a rude email.",How to Respond to Rude Email at Work," Itâs tempting to fire off a reply, but calm down with a few deep breaths. Then ask yourself if the email really deserves your attention. While you may feel offended, donât let this person dictate how you feel or the tone of your day.Focus on whatâs right for you.
Ask yourself, âWhat am I accomplishing here? What will happen if I confront this person? What will happen if I donât?â;
, We all communicate in different ways, and writing isnât a strong skill for everyone. What one person believes is a professional, direct statement can come off as brash or rude to someone else. Donât assume right away that they meant to be rude.Language or regional differences can cause miscommunications.
When people try to use sarcasm or humor in an email, it is often misconstrued as rudeness., Respond asking for more information, citing specific statements that youâd like clarified. Sometimes rude messages are just poorly worded. For example, your coworker may have sent you a message saying, âI hope you find time to actually get your reports done today.""


You could respond, âAll of my reports are complete except the one that's due tomorrow. Are you needing a draft copy for a project today?â
Donât demand to know what they mean or be curt. For example, donât ask, âWhatâs that supposed to mean?â or âWhat are you trying to say?â

, Talking to the person will allow you to better hear the tone of their words. Visit their workspace or call them to discuss your shared work or topics related to the email. Ask them to explain the rude statements from the email.Say, âI had a follow-up thought about the project and thought itâd be easier to say it in person. Do you have a minute?â
You could also say, âYour email suggested that the specs were supposed to be ready already, but the due date they sent me said they werenât due until next week. Am I working off of the wrong timeline?â

, If the email does not require a response, not sending one could be the best option. Consider not responding if you receive emails that are off topic and donât require your attention.


For example, coworkers may sometimes make assumptions about your work habits. Donât respond to an email that says, âIt must be nice to get to take extra long lunches,â or âEveryone knows that your meetings donât last all afternoon.â As long as your manager knows the truth, you're better off staying out of office drama.

, If a response is needed, the tone should be professional, even if the sender was not professional. Read your email out loud before sending it to make sure that it sounds professional rather than rude or emotional.

Avoid being blunt in your response, as that can sound rude., Your response needs to be calm and professional, so donât write it in a rush. Most emails are not time-sensitive, so you can take all day to respond if you need to.After you write your response, set it aside for about an hour.
If you know that youâre writing out of emotion, switch to a different task until you calm back down.
Add the email address last to avoid accidentally sending it early., Donât try to respond to everything, and donât provide a long personal defense. If you want to squash the rude behavior, you need to keep your email focused on work topics.Choose one work-related topic to focus on.

, One way to ensure that your email is professional is to only discuss facts. Facts include specific things like what work has been assigned and completed, due dates, timelines, data, and related topics.For example, if the rude email asked about the status of a report, say, ""Thanks for checking in. I received the new data this morning, so I'm updating my report. The new report will be available this afternoon.""
This keeps the focus of the response on the work you were assigned and the progress of your project, not on your reaction to your rude coworker.

, Itâs tempting to get defensive or rude in response to an offensive email, but it will only worsen the situation. Instead, take the professional high road.Donât accuse them of being rude.
Keep your feelings out of the email.
Before you hit send, ask yourself if any part of the email is a defense of yourself.

, If the email contains threats or a personal attack, then you should make a copy of it and discuss it with your manager and HR. Make sure that the incident is documented by your workplace, and ask that an investigation be done.

Tell them if you feel that the contents of the email create a hostile work environment.

, Make a record of each time an incident occurs to help show a pattern of behavior. If you are receiving frequent rude emails that are affecting your work environment, then take your records to your manager or HR department. Bring copies of the emails with you to show them what you mean.When deciding who to report the issue to, think about the politics of your office. As an example, if your manager is really close to the offending person, it might be best to go to HR.

, HR or your managerâs supervisor can help if your manager is the sender of a rude email. Before you report the incident, be prepared to explain why you thought the email was rude. Depending on what was said, you may be asked to fill out an incident report, be asked to attend a mediation meeting, or be reassigned to a new department.

Reporting the rude email(s) to HR will be the only way that anything can be done about your managerâs behavior toward you if it continues. You need to establish a record on file.

Get excellent grades in high school.,
Be a stellar student at a good university.,
Complete â¥ 3 years of experience work.",How to Become an Astronaut2," Get excellent grades in every subject. All of them. Every single one. Astronauts are a smart breed. Math and science are most important, but English, history, and foreign relations have their places, too. It's best to be as well-rounded as possible. Not only for you, but also because the competition will be fierce. You'll be going up against the cream of the crop.


Alright, so you don't have the power to stop time. Since you're not a machine, concentrate on math and science -- you'll be dealing with those for at least the next decade of your career training.

, A bachelor's degree in math, physics, engineering, or science from a reputable (accredited) school is required. Don't get distracted by college social life â your grades should be your number one concern.


Look into the ROTC programs, especially those of the Air Force and Navy at your college of choice. Your ultimate goal in the military is to be a test pilot because they have the most experience flying experimental aircraft.

, This can be in the form of professional experience or in the form of a degree. Should you choose to get a degree, know that a master's counts as 1 year of experience and a PhD as 3, regardless of how long it takes you to complete these degrees.


If you have experience in piloting, you must complete at least 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Be sure you also have flight test experience.
Should you choose to simply get professional experience, get a job related to something an astronaut would have to do. Examples include navigation, piloting, working with computers, chemistry/biology, or commanding a ship. You should also note that teaching is an important part of being an astronaut, and thus teachers (both college and K-12) are encouraged to apply.

, For NASA, training will take place in Texas and will last about 2 years. The ESA will put you through a similar program in Cologne, Germany for 16 months. You'll be working underwater and in simulators in addition to studying space relations and the science behind the technology. There's a heavy emphasis on human mechanics, engineering, and astronomy as well. Both programs will also immerse you in the Russian language.As for NASA, civilians who complete the training must remain a NASA employee for 5 years before becoming an astronaut. Military personal will be assigned to a specific NASA duty.

Before you have your baby, let the boss know that you plan to pump at work after returning from maternity leave.,
Be aware of what might bother your employer so that you can have counter-suggestions to offer in response.,
Know what to expect yourself.,
Have an idea of where you could possibly pump at the office after the baby is born.,
Purchase a special pump that you will use at the office only.,
Label your expressed milk and place inside a container before placing in the office refrigerator.,
Educate your coworkers if they seem confused, curious or annoyed.,
Schedule pump times around your break or lunch.,
Stick with it.,
Become an advocate for pumping milk at work.",How to Pump at Work when You Work With All Men," Be aware that many bosses and workplaces simply don't think about what it means to have to pump milk while at work for moms coming back to work after the baby's birth. While you donât have to disclose your intent, talking to a boss with whom you have a close or friendly relationship about your goal may help pave the way when you return. You donât have to get into details, but simply tell him that when you return from maternity leave, you will hopefully be still nursing your child and will need a few breaks to pump throughout the day. In some cases, a very understanding boss may even help you find the best place in the office to pump or even offer his own office if you donât have one.


Be aware that you may need to excuse yourself 2 to 3 times a day for between 20 to 30 minutes to express your breast milk. It is important to assure your boss that this will not affect your work quality and delivery as well.
Be positive when discussing this; it's a huge source of reassurance for your boss that you're already talking returning to work after having the baby, so he will be more likely to start working out ways to accommodate your needs on your return. Also note that complaints from coworkers tend to be rare. It can be helpful to provide your employer with a written plan of what you propose. This can help to firm up your intent to return and to give your boss something to use to set in motion the needed preparations. In some cases, sending an email might be the easiest way to raise the matter.;
, Some of these might include:


One concern might be the issue of ""fairness"", in that asking for breaks that others don't get might be construed as unfair. This can be approached in several ways. One is to point out that it's a fair exchange for not taking a smoking break or any other employee-permitted break outside lunch. Or say that you will do it during your time, such as morning tea time or lunch time. Another way is to offer to do the work time missed by taking the same amount of work home to complete. And reminding your boss that this is for a short time, not forever, helps.
Another cause for concern if you work for a small employer might be cost. You can reassure an employer that providing a private space need not be costly with some creative thinking about use of existing rooms within set time spans, and you might even offer to bring your own chair, mini refrigerator, or other needs if this would ease their concerns.
In unusual instances, an uninformed boss might be concerned about offending other employees. Be tactful but do remind your boss that this is the twenty-first century and that nobody will see anything they shouldn't be seeing. Send him to some websites on mothering at work to support your cause (see sites suggested below).
Always counter concerns with solutions and suggestions for workarounds, and stay positive. Remind your employer that your coming back will save having to find a new employee and that being able to pump at work will mean reduced absenteeism (now and in future), while facilitating increased productivity. They like to know these things!
Check your private health insurance policy. In some cases, you may have access to a lactation consultant, a person who might be able to visit your workplace and offer some helpful advice to the boss. Even if you don't have such coverage, this might be worth paying for out of your own pocket, for peace of mind in having a professional inform your boss what's what.

, There is a reasonable amount of knowledge you need to get across for successful pumping at work. Knowing this in advance will help you to make sound decisions. It is recommended that you read widely in this area, including online forums and sites. Also, check out How to continue breastfeeding after returning to work to help you understand implementing a schedule and storing the breast milk effectively.


Consider talking to a lactation consultant to find out what they suggest for your situation and to get acquainted with the items that will help you pump milk at work successfully.

, In fact, select three or four possibilities in the event that the first location doesnât work out or turns out to be uncomfortable. For example, a meeting room might work on one day but be booked out the next, so you'll need back-up locations. It might help ease the worries of a boss in a smaller firm to learn that you're prepared to ""move around"" the office, provided you're guaranteed suitable private space of some sort each day. Some ideas for private spots include:


Your office. If you have your own office, create a âdo not disturbâ sign to hang on your door handle and/or lock the door while you are pumping. If it has a window without a blind, have one installed that you can draw or close when pumping.
The ladies room. Find a comfortable chair or bench in the ladies room where you can relax and pump. If you have an electric pump, move the chair or bench toward an outlet for easy access. If the area does not have a place to sit, ask for one or offer to buy or bring a chair from home or in another area of the office. If the ladies room is poky and unpleasant though, this will not present a good option; quite a few restrooms fall into this latter category. Indeed, some laws, such as that in New Mexico, require that the employer provide a lactation space that is not the bathroom. Don't stick with the bathroom if you hate it and find it's unhygienic.
A coworkerâs/bossâs office. If you don't have your own office but you have a close bond with one of our coworkers or even your boss, ask if you could use his/her office when you need to pump.
A meeting room or the lunchroom. These rooms aren't as good as the other options because they are likely to be accessed at any time. However, if you can work out a time that is unlikely to cut into other people's use of the room, you can email everyone to say that this room is out of bounds from X time to X time for the next X months or so.
The stationery room. Things are fairly desperate if you're locating yourself in the stationery room but if there is enough room, a door that can be shut or even locked, it might be ideal. In fact, such rooms are often lockable in an age of worrying about resource expenses!

, The local baby store most likely sells a portable pump or even a smaller version of what you use at home. If you can keep a second pump at work you will eliminate having to remember to pack your pump every day before you go to work. However, don't do this if the second pump is inferior and causes you pain or doesn't work so well. It's better to take the one good pump everywhere than to put up with second best.


When buying a pump, do your research carefully. Not all breast pumps are alike and some are less effective than others. Read the reviews and if you have a local maternity health service that hires out breast pumps, hire some to try them out before buying one.
In some countries, your private health insurance may cover the cost of a pump. Check it before spending additional money above your insurance premiums.

, The last thing you want is for a coworker to accidentally use the human milk you placed in the company refrigerator for his coffee. By placing your milk container inside another clearly marked container, you can avoid any such ""accidents"". However, if you're not comfortable leaving your milk in the refrigerator, here are some alternative options:


Purchase a small refrigerator to keep next to your deskââthere are very small desk versions available if you look around. To save on costs, look for a used one in an online auction or at a local used white goods store. Check that your boss is okay with this first; occupational health and safety issues (noise, space, cord location, etc.) must be checked off, as well as the electricity usage.
If it is not conducive to have a small fridge next to your desk, purchase a refrigerator bag or effective chiller holder that can be sealed to hold the milk. That way there will be no confusion about the small bottles in the refrigerator and you can easily carry it straight home each day.
Note that human milk can be stored at room temperature (66-72Â°F, 19-22Â°C) for up to 10 hours and in a refrigerator (32-39Â°F, 0-4Â°C) for up to 8 days.This knowledge might help you with your storage plans.

, In some cases, no one will even notice that youâve slipped off to your private place for 10 to 20 minutes to pump. However, if you get a reaction from any coworker, use this opportunity to educate and inform your colleagues about what you're doing.


Be brief and direct. Men may not want to hear about the sacred bond of motherhood, but instead just say that your baby only drinks breast milk right now. Simply say you're pumping the milk to provide it to your baby at home. Donât mince wordsââif the men in your office giggle or make snide remarks, ignore it and chalk it up to immaturity.
Give them some scientific facts around the importance of continuing breastfeeding. Let them know that you actions are in line with the World Health Organization's recommendations for ensuring a very healthy next generation. In addition, plenty of business groups recognize the importance of pumping milk at work.
Give them the legal facts only if needed. And realize that in many jurisdictions, there are no specific laws obliging an employer to provide a lactation-friendly environment. For example, in the United States, only a handful of states require the employer to provide a lactation space or time for pumping milk.Nevertheless, don't assume that just because there isn't a direct law that you don't have rights; other employment, health and safety or discrimination laws may well cover your needs. If in doubt, and if experiencing problems with your boss or workplace, seek legal advice.

, It may take time to get into a routine, but aim to pump during times when you arenât in the height of the workday. For example, if you know that you must be in a 2pm meeting every day, do what you can to avoid pumping at or around that time. If pumping doesnât interfere with work, thereâs nothing your coworkers can really complain about.


If a meeting is scheduled for a time when you'd normally be pumping, try to pump before the meeting. Another approach is to ask that you present your piece first so that you can exit halfway through, or that you be excused until halfway through the meeting and then turn up at a pre-agreed time. If people know in advance, they will be more receptive than if you simply don't turn up or say nothing and sneak in late. If you are in a position to influence the timing and running of the meeting, make your meetings punctual and purposeful; many meetings are time-wasters anyway, so here's a chance to change that!

, As time goes on, some women who pump milk in workplaces feel obliged to cease because they feel it isn't fitting into the workplace culture or that there are just too many work things cutting in. Take a step back if you start feeling overwhelmed and remind yourself that this is for an incredibly short period of time in the greater scheme of things, it is for the benefit of your child who will most likely be healthier for it (thereby having less sick days off in the future as breastfed babies tend to be less sick) and that you are one very important player in ensuring a healthy future generation. In a year or two's time, you may well regret not sticking it out that bit longer until you chose the time to wean your child; do not be bullied, pushed about by or embarrassed into giving up pumping your breast milk. Stop when you are ready to stopââand remember that it is work that needs to be put into perspective, not your child's well being.

, If you've trail blazed at your workplace, share the experience with other women. Tell your story to your workplace's newsletter, go onto mom forums and share your experience and generally take the time to tell others (both men and women) how to manage and support pumping milk at work. For some women, knowing that this is possible may be the difference between keeping or stopping a career.

Acknowledge the conflict and the roles you and the other person have played in creating or sustaining the problem. Be honest with yourself about your own role in the situation.Think about what factors are influencing the problem, such as scheduling, personality conflicts, feeling overworked, or disrupting some kind of perceived pecking order.Look at not only your side, but the other side as well. Looking at both sides can help you understand the problem from both perspectives.;
, If the conflict is not personal, donât make it personal. Put your focus on the problem and finding ways to solve that problem. You canât change the person, and you will likely continue working with them. Even if you donât want to be friends with the person, keep your focus on the problem without making it a personal issue.Itâs easy to feel personally attacked for something, especially if itâs regarding your work. Do your best to not take things personally and keep everything within the lens of your work.

, Donât let a conflict simmer at work. If youâre able to let it go, let it go. If not, address it as soon as you can. You donât want to resent the people you work with or hold grudges against them. If you know youâll stay upset or hold something against them, aim to resolve it as quickly as possible.


Donât wait for the person to come to you. Be the first one to bring up the problem, no matter what your role is.

, A hurried conversation at your desk between emails and phone calls wonât solve anything. Put some thought into talking with the person. You need an undisturbed location and time to address the issue.


Decide whether you want to send an email or have an in-person discussion. If you speak in-person, do so away from other employees and when both of you have time to talk.

, If somebody has done something that made you angry or if you donât understand their actions, simply asking about it can make a world of difference. Donât assume that people do what they do to annoy or harm you. Sometimes, thereâs good reason why that person does what he or she does. Other times, they may not even realize that they did something hurtful, and bringing it to their attention can clarify their intentions. Make an inquiry, not an accusation.âSay, I was wondering why you brushed off my question yesterday,â or âIâve noticed that you cut my work down, and Iâm wondering why that is.â

, When hashing things out with a coworker, donât make it all about you. Be willing to hear them out, listen to their perspective, and consider their feelings. Give them ample time to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. If they feel defensive, let them express that. Let them talk without interrupting them.Donât take up the whole interaction with your side. Be willing to hear them out. You may gain more information or understand them better.
Check to see if theyâre done speaking. Say, âIs there anything else you want to add or say to me?â

, Find some common ground with the person. This might mean that both of you acknowledge that a problem exists or that something needs to be solved. Perhaps you can agree that both you and they need to do something to create resolution. Whatever it is, find something each of you can get behind.For example, if you feel bullied, both of you might agree that you have problems getting along or splitting responsibilities.
Say, âI want us to resolve this. Letâs find some things we can agree upon so that we can move forward.â

, Apologize for your part in the conflict. Usually everyone involved has done something to create and sustain the conflict. Own up to how you contributed to the dispute and express regret and responsibility. Remember: youâre not accepting the entire blame, youâre taking responsibility for your contribution to the situation.For example, say, âIâm sorry I said those hurtful things. I was upset, but it wasnât right of me to call you that.â

, If your coworker says something offensive or hurtful, resist the urge to fire something harsh back. You might say something you regret or blow the issue out of proportion. If a conflict arises, take some time to think it over before immediately responding. You may come to realize that you misheard them, misunderstood them, or need further clarification.Immediately responding will likely mean you respond in a negative way.

, Keep from becoming defensive or blaming the other person. Even if you feel victimized, donât pour your negativity onto them. It might be tempting to call them out and let others know how theyâve wronged you, but keep some decorum as this is your workplace.If you want to express how you feel wronged or hurt, use âIâ statements. For example, say, âI felt really hurt when you took credit for the project during the meeting,â instead of, âI canât believe you did that. Youâre a horrible person.â, Your human resources department can help you solve workplace conflicts. If the conflict is growing larger or you feel like you want to quit over it, now is the time to get HR involved. You may also want to involve your HR department if the conflict is personal or workplace morale is low for you and maybe even those around you.Your HR department can send someone to mediate or get you and the other person talking more constructively. A good mediator will help the disputants find their own solution, not provide advice or push them toward any particular solution.

, Once you feel like youâve talked over the problem, propose possible solutions. Keep the focus on the future and how each of you can respond better.Find points where you can compromise or work on communicating more effectively. Create a different way of problem-solving or working together, such as taking turns or writing things out instead of saying them out loud.

If you canât create a plan on your own, involve your manager or HR in creating ways to approach conflicts.
For example, if the person talks over you in meetings, say, âI want to be heard. Is it possible for you to wait until I finish speaking to chime in? If you start to talk over me, I will ask you to let me finish.â

, Itâs not enough to just create a resolution. Both you and the other person must follow through on any agreed-upon solutions. Discuss ways to stay accountable, whether that means that other co-workers will participate or your workplace will step in. Create a system to be accountable. You might want to include HR in enforcing any changes.For example, if you struggle to have balance in projects, divvy up tasks before starting the project so that they feel fair and equal. Have someone neutral step in and get their opinion on the tasks.

, Depending on the dispute, you may need to make some changes. For example, if you canât find resolution, consider changing departments or taking a different role in your workplace. If you know talking to the person will upset you or cause problems, engage only in âwater coolerâ discussions. Do what you can to avoid creating or perpetuating further disputes."

Talk to the participant who is muttering after the meeting.,
Emphasize the word ""respect"" when dealing with this person.,
Put the muttering participant on the spot if they don't respect your initial discussion or they disrupt the meeting excessively.,
Stop the meeting.",How to Cope with a Muttering Meeting Member1," Talk to this person in a quiet place rather than making them feel exposed. It is best to ride out the meeting in which the muttering is taking place rather than exposing this person because they will probably react defensively and either storm out or start an argument that creates bad relations within the meeting and fouls up the proceedings. Instead, follow up the muttering behavior with a chat, or even a warning, after the occasion, to try to lessen the embarrassment or exposure factor. Take the muttering participant to one side after a meeting and inform this person:


How the muttering comes across to everyone present
Let them know that it gives the impression of undermining the meeting and colleagues
If it is the case that the mutterings can be clearly heard, then let the mutterer know this and inform them that if they intend for the comments to be heard, that they should speak clearly and directly to the points as this will carry greater weight and will earn them respect.;
, Nobody likes to feel that they are earning disrespect for their actions and if you can make this clear, it will help deter the participant from future unhelpful comments.

, If the muttering and snide commentary is really disruptive during the meeting, it may be necessary to deal with the mutterer in the course of the meeting itself:


Wait for a natural pause (round-up time of a particular topic is good) and very nicely but firmly inform the muttering participant that you have noticed their wish to provide input to the meeting but that you didn't quite catch what it was they said.
Ask this person to kindly repeat the comments more loudly so that you can clarify their contribution. This is a direct and confrontational method for the person who is muttering - you will need to judge the person and the context to see if this is a good and fair approach. It will put an end to the muttering most likely; most people in this position would feel too embarrassed to repeat the action for the remainder of the meeting. And likely they will cease whenever you are chairing it too.

, This is a really confrontational measure that is usually applied in the classroom. But it can be effective if you have already spoken with the muttering participant or warned this person before and they did not cease muttering. Simply pause the meeting. As the chairperson or meeting leader, halt someone speaking for a moment with a hand movement or stop talking yourself. Be silent for 5 - 10 seconds and then turn to the muttering participant and ask them to kindly stop the running commentary as it is disrupting the meeting. As already stated, this is a confrontational approach meant to embarrass and should only be held in reserve for the worst offenders who will not be persuaded by other means.

Get involved with professional consultation/support groups.,
Make and take opportunities to socialize with workmates.,
Keep your training up-to-date.,
Use your vacation leave.,
Make time to meditate.",How to Cope with a Career Where Mistakes Can Cost Lives1," As situations and people change it may be necessary to seek support from trained professionals that can help you manage your stress in the environment you are exposed to.


Find out what debriefings are offered at your workplace. In some case, they will be mandatory (such as after an incident), in other cases, by choice (such as general coping strategies). Even where they are voluntary, consider using them to help you unwind and deal with challenges you have faced.






Make use of work sponsored psychologists, counselors and the like. They are available for good reason.





;
, Anything that lets you connect socially with those who deal with the same work conditions as you do can help relieve some of the resulting stress.

, Keeping your skills sharp will make you feel more confident and prepared for the situations you face every day. Whatever your field of expertise and skill, things keep changing. Stay abreast of changes through training, development opportunities and continued learning. If your workplace is slow to initiate such learning, suggest courses and online training that you are aware of and ask that they let you undertake the learning.

, Time spent completely away from a stressful environment rejuvenates you and gives you renewed energy to return in a focused way. Sometimes a vacation can provide you with new insights and perspective, allowing you to see the bigger picture and not get so caught up in stressful minutiae.

, In an Australian study of 178 full-time workers, it was found that meditation reduced work stress and depressive feelings, compared to people who made time to relax (sitting still without meditating) and people who did not meditate or relax at all.Participants used mindfulness meditation, in which they were encouraged to focus on the moment. See How to Do Mindful Meditation and practice twice daily for 10-20 minutes at a time.

Ask the chairperson or meeting leader to speak with the disruptive person.,
Feel free to talk to the muttering participant colleague-to-colleague.,
Do not reply, but try ignoring the mutterer or give a glance showing annoyance.",How to Cope with a Muttering Meeting Member2," If you are not the chairperson or meeting leader, but simply another participant at the meeting, ask the meeting leader for a quick chat after the meeting. Tell them how disruptive you found the person who was muttering all the time and how it impacted your hearing, your ability to concentrate and your understanding of what was going on. These are good, neutral and outcome-impacting reasons that the chairperson or meeting leader can use to present a case to the muttering participant as reasons to stop muttering and making snide remarks.

, This can often be the most effective as a form of peer pressure when the person making inane side remarks realizes that their antics are not appreciated and are not winning them any points with the colleagues. Again, keep to the facts as in the step above.

, Sometimes a muttering participant is trying to get others to accept that they know more than the speaker. This kind is looking for personal validation, and failing to get that, they may stop. If they do not, and you have their attention or are seated close, try a short glance of annoyance. If the person is close and persists, a low comment ""Sh, I want to hear this."" could work.

Get enough rest.,
Take care of yourself and stay in good health.,
Have a healthy diet.,
Get adequate exercise.,
Don't forget about your friends and families.",How to Cope with a Career Where Mistakes Can Cost Lives2," Having enough balanced and routine sleep is of the utmost importance.Getting adequate sleep levels may have an effect on your social life, but remember the objective. This does not imply that you should not have social events, it only means that social events should not interfere with your well-needed rest. Remember, little rest equals little concentration.


Lack of sleep can compound stress through reduced energy, impaired cognitive functions, mood changes and much lowered concentration ability.Any worry about interrupted sleep can increase your stress levels. Sleeping well when it is possible to do so will help you cope better with unavoidable periods of interrupted sleep (such as for emergency call-outs, a sudden need to do shift work, etc.).







, People with high stress levels are more vulnerable to illnesses such as colds and flu.It is important to keep your immune system as strong as possible. Bad health could really impact you when you need to be at your best.


Vitamins and the occasional flu shot will help minimize the risk of becoming ill.






Visit a doctor regularly for check-ups to ensure that you're in good health. Things like high or low blood pressure and/or sugar levels impact the ability of your body to cope with stressful job situations.







, Eating the right foods and drinking enough water will not only boost your health, immune system and help you feel great, but will also help you manage fatigue allowing you to concentrate better and for longer on the important things at hand.Substances like drugs, alcohol and even strong medication could affect your decision making ability, both short- and long-term.


Keep a water bottle with you at all times. Drink water regularly through each work session to improve concentration and to relieve minor fatigue., Regular exercise is great as it improves overall health, but equally importantly it reduces stress.If you feel that you do not have the energy for exercise because of the high stress levels that drain you or that you do not have the time, think again! If you follow the steps outlined above, then you will have more energyââand if you are serious about controlling your stress levelsââyou will have to make time. The benefits of being moderately to highly active (outside of work) will become apparent to you after a couple of weeks.This is a very important step and will improve all the benefits listed above. (It is also recommended that you consult a doctor for a check-up before starting an exercise program.)


Pick exercise that you enjoy and that works for your body type. This may take trial and error but don't assume that because you hate one type, that all exercise won't work. While some love the gym, others love the outdoor run, the cycle, the ice rink or the spin class.






Physical work isn't just about regulated exercise forms. Doing up your garden, house or some other physically involved activities can help to reduce stress in between work.







, Family, friends, pets and the environment (nature) are sacred and valuable contributions to your overall health and well-being.People tend to get trapped in the stress that they're exposed to at work and, as a result, tend to forget the fun and relaxation of spending time with others. Time spent with friends, family, a friendly house pet or even just spending time with all the wonderful things that nature provides, will rejuvenate you and help you to realize that there is a positive balance to the hard and less positive things that you're dealing with each day.


Changing negative behaviour and/or feelings for positive can be as simple as changing the usual environment that you are in.

Know your own reasons for being a writer.,
Try to stand in the shoes of those who are viewing the writing role as superfluous or easily outsourced.,
Argue your proficiency as a well-established writer.,
Emphasize your knowledge of the art of rhetoric.,
Remind those you seek to convince that you write for the intended audience.,
Demonstrate that you can deliver a consistent voice.,
Note that you can write on a multitude of platforms.,
Argue that you have the time to write well.,
Bring up your knowledge of modern copyright laws.,
Stress that you value writing ethically.,
Highlight how you streamline the writing process.,
Maintain that you give a company or organization an edge.",How to Argue Your Value As a Professional Writer," It is far harder to defend anything if you don't truly believe in its worth. Be prepared to reveal the passion for what you're doing. Identify the reasons that motivate you to be a writer, both now and into the future, so that these reasons are at the forefront of your mind, motivating your argument and helping you to better express them when pressed. If you're a highly proficient, professional writer who has produced a lot of verifiable, good work that can be pointed to as factual evidence of your value, you're already halfway there; it simply needs to be made clear to those less understanding.;
, You need to understand where such people are coming from, so that you can counteract their every misinformed idea about the value of in-house writing and fill in their gaps of knowledge with respect to the worth of targeted writing for the company or organization. Keep in mind that many people are under a mistaken belief that good writing is easy. It isn't; good writing is hard work and requires a lot of skill and knowledge. Moreover, being a writer is a fairly solitary and unglamorous existence, something that people often don't realize. Your ability to cope with this reality is already astounding, so bear in mind the possible misconceptions when trying to understand the point of view of your adversaries, so that you can successfully counteract them.

, Communication is the foundation of every successful business, and you have the ability to communicate effectively and professionally. You can turn ideas into content that has the ability to inform, persuade or inspire. You are a tool for not only creating effective content, but for excellence in grammar, vocabulary and editing. You are also aware of the importance of plain English to produce writing that works, writing that does its job without anyone having to ask for further explanation. A professional writer produces professional content.

, This skill produces strong, well-organized and audience-focused writing. A good professional writer is well versed and practiced in rhetoric. You know the art of effective communication and creating authoritative arguments and understand the importance of both content and form. As a writer, you will always evaluate rhetorical techniques to tailor writing to specific audiences.

, With all communication there is an audience, a message to be delivered, and a means to get the message from the sender to the recipient. As a professional writer you become the messenger. A company or organization should value whom they chose to deliver the content because a lot can be lost in translation when using writers unfamiliar with the company's or organization's aims, mission and purpose. As a professional writer, you focus on user-centered texts and will utilize the best method of delivery without losing the messageâs meaning.

, It is important for a company or organization to maintain constancy for all of their communications. By having a professional writer, the company or organization identity and voice will remain consistent and fluid. While the collaboration of ideas is essential, the identified voice of one professional writer communicating on behalf of the company or organization will make the message that much stronger.

, Technology is constantly creating different platforms for a business to communicate information to their audience. As a professional writer you are expected to keep up with the emerging technology and not only know how to utilize it, but recognize how it may alter the meaning and adjust accordingly. By having a professional writer who is able to write for the digital world, a companyâs or organization's message will be more accessible and the companyâs or organization's image will stay current.


Be sure to keep a portfolio of examples at-the-ready all the time, that demonstrates both your print and online writing versatility. Be able to list all of the online formats you're comfortable writing in, from blogs and websites to complete articles.

, While people in other positions may write well, they are expected to be productive in their principal role while writing consistently good copy, articles, etc., can be distracting, time-consuming, and burdensome for them thus, negatively affecting productivity not only in their principal role, but also in the secondary role as an ad hoc writer. Having a person whose time is dedicated to writing will make sure that everything that goes out will be done well and done on time. Note that in the switch from print to screen, the amount of content a company or organization can produce becomes seemingly limitless. Online material is easily distributed and navigated by the audience, so a company or organization needs more content, more often and always up-to-date. Having a dedicated writer ensures that there will be no loss in productivity in other departments trying to meet this increase in writing needs.

, A professional writer is responsible for knowing the current copyright laws for all the different methods of communication and will be expected to adhere to these. Since your expertise is writing, you need to not only be on top of developments in technology but the copyright laws for these new platforms for writing. Moreover, taking care of this aspect for your company or organization seamlessly is reassuring and prevents hold-ups in having to get writing from other departments checked or vetted through someone else.

, A professional writer values ethics when representing a company or organization. There is a risk of misrepresentations being unknowingly produced by people who are not trained to write or who lack familiarity with the underpinnings and philosophy of the company or organization. This can result in confusion over the companyâs or organization's image and can even lead to legal repercussions. Writing has the power to get a reaction for good and bad and as a professional writer you will consistently focus on avoiding the negative impacts of that power.

, Someone who is trained and is familiar with the depth and scope of writing will have better time management and will spend less time working on a piece than someone who is not familiar with writing. This will result in increased productivity and the ability to turn around projects quickly.

, A companyâs success requires the right tools and a good professional writer can be a secret weapon. You provide the bang and the direct shot to the audience. Every company or organization should make an informative decision regarding who should be in charge of their communications and put great value on that position. A companyâs or organization's reputation, image and voice all depend upon the professionally written image. You have to repeatedly articulate that it is in a companyâs or organization's best interest to utilize you as a professional writer as an effective part of their business plan.

Research the restaurant ahead of time.,
Dress appropriately for the type of business function.,
Arrive on time or early.,
Shake hands and look people in the eye when speaking to them.,
Treat your server and the other restaurant staff respectfully throughout the meal.,
Make wise choices regarding alcohol.,
Shift the conversation to business talk at the appropriate time.,
Silence your phone and put it away.,
Handle the bill appropriately.,
Excuse yourself when leaving the table.,
Select a suitable meal choice.,
Sit up straight and keep your elbows off the table.,
Begin eating once everyone has been served.,
Place your napkin in your lap and avoid talking with your hands while holding your silverware.,
Chew with your mouth closed.,
Place your fork and knife in the proper position once the meal is over.",How to Act During a Business Meal," You do not want to appear indecisive or nervous during a business lunch. Doing some research on the restaurant will allow you to know what to expect going into the meeting. You will also be able to choose an entree ahead of time so you can order smoothly.You can usually look up the menu online if the restaurant has a website. If it does not, a site like MenuPages may be able to provide this information. Try to pick an entree beforehand, and also a backup choice just in case the restaurant is out of your chosen meal.
Also, try to get a feel for the atmosphere. You do not want to be thrown off by being surprised by a restaurant's ambiance. Go into the situation knowing what to expect so you can keep your cool during the meeting.;
, You will want to get a sense of how you should dress. A business lunch can sometimes be more casual than a formal interview or a regular meeting, but there may still be etiquette regarding attire. Try to feel out what would be appropriate to wear going into the lunch.Read over the invitation you would sent again and look for any hints. The sender, for example, may have said something like, ""It's a casual restaurant, so feel free to wear something comfortable."" In this case, there is no need to wear a business suit. However, do not show up in jeans and a t-shirt. Wear something like dress pants and a nice button-down shirt or blouse.
If you're unsure what appropriate attire is, it's okay to find a tactful way to ask. For example, you could email the host something like, ""I'll be coming from the office, and I usually wear a polo shirt and khakis to work. Will that be appropriate for the restaurant?""

, You never want to be late for a business meal. It's obvious to everyone who arrived on time when you come in late and attempt to find a seat. By arriving early, you can observe how seating is being arranged and where you'll be sitting. Arriving about five minutes before your scheduled meal time is socially acceptable.Look up how long it takes to get to the restaurant. Make sure you give yourself enough time to find the restaurant and park. If you're taking public transportation, make sure you review bus and train schedules ahead of time.
It's a good idea to give yourself slightly more time than you think you will need. Something like traffic or a train or bus delay could cause you to take longer than expected. Try to give yourself about 20 minutes of leeway. You can always get coffee nearby or walk around the area if you're early.
It may be a good idea to swing by the restaurant a day or so before the meeting to make sure you know how to get there.

, If you are meeting someone for the first time at this meal, make sure to firmly shake their hand and maintain eye contact while doing so. The same body language that can convey confidence during a job interview should be used in a business lunch. You want to be sure to look confident and greeting someone this way will exude poise and self-assurance. Walk into the meeting feeling secure, standing up straight, and offer a smile, eye contact, and a handshake., Part of acting appropriately during a business meal is maintaining comfort during a social situation. This means treating everyone present with respect, including the restaurant staff. Be certain that you say please and thank you, ask questions kindly, and make requests to your server politely.You want to make sure you come off as someone easy to get along with. This means you should laugh off mistakes servers made and not respond with anger or hostility if the bill is wrong or your order was screwed up.
Never send your food or drink back, especially if your boss or superior picked the restaurant. Not only will this make you look difficult, it can come off as insulting or ungrateful.

, Determine what kind of business meal youâre attending so you know if alcohol consumption is appropriate. Look around while at the restaurant to see if anyone is drinking. If no one is, donât drink either. If alcohol consumption is acceptable, stick to just two glasses of wine or one mixed drink or martini. Anything more is considered excessive and can also cause you to behave differently. You want to make certain youâre maintaining a good image while conducting business.If possible, wait until your boss or co-workers order. If your host or your co-workers are ordering drinks, it may be okay for you to have a cocktail.
However, if your boss is having water or something non-alcoholic like tea, it's a good idea to stay away from alcohol. Drinking when the other party is remaining sober can look unprofessional.

, It is best to focus on casual conversation before your meal begins. Allow for casual conversation initially and make small talk with the other party. After a few minutes of small talk, introduce the topic at hand.When you begin the business talk is not always clearÂ cut. However, a good rule of thumb is to stick to light personal topics until food and drinks have been ordered.
Ask about the other party as much as you talk about yourself. Ask about your host's business endeavors, and show a genuine interest. If you're talking to someone from a different company, make sure to ask a lot of the company's culture, goals, and values. This is especially important if a business lunch is part of an interview process.

, Nowadays, phones seem to be attached to peopleâs hips, but this is not at all appropriate while attending a business meal. Silence or turn your phone off before sitting down to eat and keep your phone concealed. You should avoid conducting business while at the table using your phone. Focus on the conversation and business being conducted at the table., When the bill comes, this can be uncomfortable. People feel awkward when it comes to money, tipping, and other aspects of payment. Whether you're paying or not, make sure to behave tactfully when the bill arrives.If you're paying the bill, make sure to tip well. Tipping adequately can say a lot about a person. A good rule of thumb is to tip between 20 and 25 percent.
If you're paying the bill, only glance at the total. Try to keep your expression neutral. If there are any mistakes with the bill, deal with them after your guest has left.
If the other party is paying, make sure to thank them for lunch before leaving. Send a follow-up email the next day, thanking them again.

, If at any point you need to leave the table to use the restroom or take an important phone call, be sure to politely excuse yourself quietly and carefully. Do not abruptly leave the table and cause confusion, disruption or noise.Remember, when excusing yourself, place your napkin on the chair and not the table. Placing your napkin on the table signifies you're leaving the restaurant, while placing it on the chair signifies you'll be back momentarily.

, Be careful when ordering. You want to make sure you pick something that is appropriate in terms of price. You should also avoid anything too messy, as you do not want to make things awkward by struggling to handle your food.Try to get a sense of what others are ordering first and pick something within the same price range. You should not order lobster if your other guests are eating sandwiches or salads.
If you're dining with a potential new boss or colleague, strive to match what he or she is ordering. You want to look like you fit in with the culture. If your boss is health conscious, for example, do not order a hamburger after he or she orders a caesar salad.
Pick food that's easy to eat. You do not want to be struggling with a rack of ribs while you're trying to have a conversation. You should also avoid anything that produces a strong smell, as you don't want to do anything that could potentially annoy a co-worker, boss, or colleague.

, Proper table manners are key to making a good impression. Sit up nice and straight and donât slouch while at the table. Keep your hands in your lap or gently by your sides and avoid resting them on the table. These are very basic table manners, but you may forget them if you're nervous., When the food begins to come out, pay close attention and only start eating once you see everyone at the table has been served. It is considered rude to begin eating before everyoneâs food has arrived.You should also try to eat at roughly the same pace as your colleagues. Eating too fast or too slow can make others feel awkward.

, Make sure you put your napkin in your lap before consuming any food. If any food drops or you spill, you want to be sure your clothes are protected by your napkin. Additionally, while eating, try to avoid moving your hands a great deal or obnoxiously while holding your silverware., This is an oldie but a goodie: make sure you never speak with food in your mouth and always chew with your mouth closed. You want to make sure you look polished and sophisticated while attending a business meal and this can be accomplished through simple table manners about chewing., When the meal is over, you will want to signify to the waiter you are done eating. Take your fork and knife and place them in the four o'clock position. This means you place your fork and knife across your plate. If your plate were a clock, your fork and knife would be pointing to four. The knife should be above the fork, with the blade pointing inward.You should also place your napkin on the table next to your plate.
Even while you're signifying your finished, wait staff usually ask if you're done out of courtesy. Smile and say, ""Yes,"" and then thank the waiter for removing your plate.

Create a pre-call strategy.,
Gather information on the customer.,
Leave an effective voicemail if the customer does not pick up.",How to Survive As a Telemarketer1," Before you even pick up the phone, you should consider how you are going to approach the customer. The telemarketing company you work for may provide a script that you can follow during the call, but it may be useful to consider what you as a telemarketer want to communicate to the customer. Often, you can be more successful during the call if you take the customer into account and speak with passion and genuine enthusiasm.You should consider what you want the customer to do as a result of the call and what you want to achieve by the end of the call. This could be donating to the cause you are calling for, purchasing a service or item you are selling, or simply listen to information on a product and agreeing to a follow up call.
You should come up with a secondary objective for every sales call. This should be a simple action or agreement from the customer that you should try to accomplish every time you call a customer. This will help you see each call as an accomplishment or a success, even if you do not achieve the primary goal of getting the customer to donate or buy the service or product.
For example, you may have a secondary goal of getting the customer to agree to accept information or literature on the product or service and be okay with being placed on a follow up call list.;
, To improve your chances at a sale or a donation, you should work with your boss and/or your co workers to profile potential customers. Analyzing the customer call list and focusing on certain customers who have been open to donations or sales in the past will increase the likelihood of success.Often when you are cold-calling, you do not have access to very much information on the customer or their needs. You will need to get this information during the call instead. But focusing on strategic call lists, where you separate customers who have been receptive in the past and focus on them first, early in the day or in the week, can improve your confidence as a telemarketer. One sale or donation early on from a receptive customer can help you survive the rest of the work week.

, In a recent study, nearly 75% of all telemarketing calls reach the customerâs voicemail. Leaving an effective voicemail may encourage the customer to call you back and increase their interest in your product or service.To create an effective voicemail, you should keep the message short, no longer than 45 seconds. You should also mention the purpose for your call and describe the solution or improvement your company is offering. You should also say the customerâs name at the beginning and the end of the message and offer a callback number at the beginning and the end of the message.
A sample voicemail could be: âHello Jenna. This is Pierre with TeleMarket Solutions. My phone number is xxx-xxxx. The reason Iâm calling you is to talk about marketing strategies in online media to improve your businessâ sales and boost your business profile online. If you are interested in elevating your businessâ online presence, please contact Pierre at xxx-xxxx. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you, Jenna.â

"
Use interest opening statements.,
Ask open ended questions.,
Look for commitment from the customer before making the sales pitch.,
Close the call on a positive note, even if you do not make a sale.,
Address any resistance or objections with openness, rather than defensiveness.",How to Survive As a Telemarketer2," The first few seconds when the customer answers are critical to landing a sale or a donation. You will need to provide an answer to âWhatâs in it for me?â for the customer to keep them on the line.Avoid rhetorical questions, such as âIf I could tell you how to improve your online presence as a business, you would be interested in this, wouldnât you?â You should avoid a generic opening, such as âI was just calling people in your area and youâre next on my listâ. You want to customer to feel unique and important, not just another name on a list.
Focus on interest opening statements that use non confrontational language. For example: âHello, Jenna, This is Pierre from TeleMarket Solutions. Depending on how your business is doing with its online presence, I might have a program that could potentially increase your online traffic and online sales. Iâd like to ask you a few quick questions to see if this something that would be useful for your business.â

, Once the customer agrees to answer a few questions, thank them for their time and start with simple, open ended questions. You should also specify how long the questions will take, usually no more than five to ten minutes. This will let the customer know how much time you are going to need from them and make it clear that your sales pitch will be concise and to the point.For example, if you are trying to see a program that focuses on strategies for online sales, you could start by asking the customer, âHow long have you been in business?â âDo you have an existing online presence, such as a website or a social media account?â âWhat are you looking for in terms of your online presence? Sales? Advertising? A combination of both?â
Make sure you ask only one question at a time and are an attentive listener. Make note of the customerâs answers and confirm their needs before moving on to the sales pitch. You should thank the customer for answering your three questions and restate their answers back to them to make sure you understand their needs. For example: âThank you for sharing that information with me. Iâm hearing that you are looking for a program that will increase your online sales and raise your online profile. Is that correct?â

, If the customer appears receptive after answering the three open ended questions, they will often encourage you to tell them more or will at least be willing to stay on the line with you. Take this as a sign that they are at least somewhat interested in your product or service. At this point, you can discuss the potential benefits of the service or product in response to the customerâs needs.You may say: âBased on the information you have provided with me, Jenna, I recommend you consider the benefits of our program. Our program will actually address several of your needs and boost your online sales.â
This is also the point where you can tell the customer about the benefits of the service, share customer testimonials and provide a detailed explanation of the features of the service or product. This should help to get the customer more excited and engaged in what you are selling.

, Once you finish your sales pitch, you should then check in with the customer to make sure they are still interested in your product or service and if they reply positively, you can then offer several options to end the call. This could be signing up for the service or product, agreeing to a follow up call, or agreeing to receive more information via email or mail.


Try to end the call by getting to customer to sign on for at least one of these three options. This way, even if you do not make the sale, you can end the call on a positive note and feel you have accomplished at least one goal of your call.

, If you receive any resistance or objection from the customer at any point in the call, resist the desire to get defensive or angry. Instead, it is important that you interpret the customerâs objection and try to counteract them by providing a solution to their objection in the form of your product or service.Avoid using rebuttals that point out the customer is wrong. Focus on listening to the objections of the customer and do not give up without trying to provide an answer or a solution to their issue.
For example, the customer may say they already have a program for online business sales and do not need your services. You can counter this by asking if their existing program has certain features or is cheaper than your service.

"
"
Look at every call as a potential accomplishment.,
Lean on your co workers for support and encouragement.,
Be open to constructive feedback.,
Focus on each customerâs need, rather than your quota.",How to Survive As a Telemarketer3," Rather than view a call where you do not sell a product or do not get the customer to sign up for a service as a failure, look at each call as full of potential and future accomplishment. Even if the customer says no, simply getting the customer to talk to you for one minute and listen to your outline of the benefits of the product should be viewed as a minor achievement. Telemarketing is a difficult industry and connecting with a customer, even if you do not get a sale, can energize you for the next call.It can help to end a call by planting a seed for future contact or communication so you do not feel the call is a rejection or a firm ânoâ. If you cannot achieve the primary objective of selling the product or service, you can try to achieve the secondary objective of getting the customer to listen to the benefits of the product or agree to a call back at a later time.
For example, âJenna, it looks like we do not have a good fit here today but if you find yourself needing a program for online sales that is cheaper and full of extra features, please get in touch with me.â

, Often, getting told ânoâ or being hung up on as a telemarketer can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression. Rather than isolate yourself when you feel this way, look to your co workers for support and encouragement. Try sharing a bad end to a call with a co worker to let off steam and suggest you go for a quick walk or take a coffee break together to shake off the rough call. Your co workers have likely all had to deal with a bad call or an angry customer and can offer words of sympathy and encouragement., Another way to improve your sales record as a telemarketer, and make your job that much easier, is to be willing to take constructive feedback from your superiors or your co workers. Agree to extra training on how to be an effective cold caller and listen attentively to any suggestions from others on how to improve your cold calling skills.


By focusing on how you can get better at your job, you can also avoid getting bored in the role or feeling unfulfilled. Learning new skills in the role can keep you engaged and excited about doing your job.

, Many telemarketing companies have quotas their employees must fulfill every week or month. These quotas can be stressful, as you will be under a lot of pressure to meet the quota, especially in the last several days of the quota period. Rather than focus on how you are going to land a high amount of sales, which can lead to stress and anxiety, think about connecting with each customer every time you pick up the phone. By looking at each call as an opportunity to connect with someone, you will be less overwhelmed by pressure to fill a quota and will likely improve your sales record by being genuine and enthusiastic.It can also help to keep in mind telemarketing is a very difficult job, with a high level of turnover. Having a strong pre calling plan and approach and practicing your ability to connect with customers on a daily basis will make you a stronger telemarketer and help you thrive in the role.

Learn from experience.",How to Be a Good Seller," You should sell high-quality products that the customer can actually derive benefit or pleasure from.


Buyer's remorse is a reaction you should try to avoid at all costs. You may have made a one-time purchase, but a customer who regrets purchasing your product won't return a second time and probably won't recommend you to anyone else.;
, Customers will only consider buying from you if the product you offer can compete in quality and price with similar products.Determine who your competition is, then spend some time researching your competitors' products.
If you sell within a broader online marketplace (like eBay, Etsy, or Amazon Marketplace), you'll need to focus your attention on competing sellers within that marketplace.
Similarly, if you sell products in person, you'll need to research local competitors to make sure that your prices can compare positively with theirs.

, Buyers prefer to see the exact product they'll be purchasing. When possible, they will usually want to handle the product directly before agreeing to purchase it.


This is a fairly simple task to accomplish in person, but when you're selling online, succeeding visually will require the use of high-quality photographs.
Photographs of your products need to show each item in the best possible light and from all possible angles. Your primary photograph for the product should show the item at its best., Communication is important, but in most cases, the buyer should be able to find out everything he or she needs to know about a product without saying a word to you.


The price of an item should always be visible, as should any information regarding the contents or origin of the product.
This point is especially crucial for online sales. Most customers will never speak to you before deciding whether or not to buy from your online shop, so any information you would usually state in conversation should be provided in the item's description.

, May people use both their hearts and minds when making a purchase. You'll need to use emotion to grab the customer's attention and reason to seal the deal.For instance, a book's catchy title and appealing cover art appeal to a prospective buyer's emotions. The back cover summary of the book's plot appeals to the buyer's mind by presenting information that lets the buyer know if he or she might actually enjoy the book.

, Invite open communication from the beginning through the end of the overall sales experience.


Anticipate questions and answer them before your customers have to ask.
This can be especially important for online sales. Keep your customer updated on the status of the order. Let the buyer know when you've processed payment and when you've shipped the item. Check in later to make sure that the item arrived safely.

, It may not be feasible to build a close relationship with every potential customer you meet, but you should try to establish a temporary connection with each prospect you come into contact with.By showing the customer that you view him or her as a human instead of a paycheck, you encourage the customer to view you as a fellow human, too.
When selling a product in person, carefully observe the approaching prospect. Try to find something you have in common or offer an honest compliment.
When selling a product online, thank the buyer for his or her interest. Demonstrate interest in the buyer's needs, too, by asking questions that can direct the buyer to the best product for his or her circumstances.

, No two customers are exactly alike, so you'll need to pay attention to each customer's personality and act accordingly.


On a basic level, introverted customers usually like to be left alone while extroverted customers may prefer to be actively engaged.
For sales made in person, you'll need to pay attention to body language.
For sales made online, you'll need to wait for the customer to reach out to you with a question or comment. Once that happens, try to respond with the same level of enthusiasm demonstrated by the customer's words.

, Customers want their money's worth; in other words, they want to buy good products that will last a long time. If a customer has some concern about the value of your product, you need to address that concern honestly and tactfully.


Some buyers will have a direct question about your product, like an inquiry on the size, weight, or functionality of the item.
Oftentimes, though, concerns are masked by misconceptions. It is your job to identify and correct the perception that prevents the buyer from purchasing your product.

, No matter what your customer asks or says, your reply must always be honest. You should never overstate the value of a product or ignore sour details for the sake of making a sale.


If the customer catches you in a lie, you'll almost always lose that sale. Even worse, that customer may never consider buying from you again and could even discourage others from buying from you, too.
On the other hand, you might still lose the sale by being honest about the shortcomings of a particular product, but you'll build a good reputation with that potential buyer. That positive reputation may bring the buyer back to your shop for a different product.

, The sales environment can be a stressful one, but if you want to succeed as a seller, you'll need to learn how to handle that stress in a calm and collected manner.


Rude customers can be especially trying, but you'll need to resist the urge to return discourtesy with discourtesy. Being friendly with a rude customer might be impossible, but you should still be polite and professional.

, Nobody likes to feel pressured during a sale, so when interact with your customer, you need to avoid any statement or action that may create tension.


Persistently and consistently engage the customer, but once your customer starts backing off, you need to do the same. Doing otherwise may make you seem pushy and intimidating.

, Depending on the circumstances, you might be able to increase the sales total by recommending products related to the main product your customer has decided to buy.


Choose items that may genuinely benefit the customer. The add-on product should either improve the original product or address some fear related to the original purchase.
For instance, you might recommend matching earrings to a customer interested in buying a necklace or security pens to a customer buying a checkbook cover.

, At minimum, purchases must be packaged safely before being handed or shipped to the customer. It's also good to package purchases in an aesthetically pleasing manner.


Products that can break must be wrapped in an adequate amount of padding or tissue paper to protect them.
Consider printing shopping bags with your company's logo or including customized business cards inside boxed packages. Even small details can make the buying experience more exciting for the customer.

, Encourage customers to buy another product later by including a free sample of that product with his or her original purchase.


For example, you might include small sample tubes of lip balm when a customer purchases other lip care products from you, or a sample swatch of perfume when a customer purchases a matching lotion.
Unlike samples, free gifts won't encourage the customer to buy any specific product from you in the future, but they can build your reputation with the customer and cause him or her to visit your shop again. Gifts should be small but meaningful. For instance, a seller at a book store might throw a free bookmark into the shopping bag before handing it over to the customer.

, When an unforeseen circumstance damages the product after the transaction has already concluded, and neither you nor the buyer are at fault, you will need to take the loss instead of forcing it on your buyer.


You may never encounter this issue if you sell in person, but you'll probably deal with it at some point if you plan to sell online. For example, if the purchased product gets lost or damaged in the mail, you'll need to be willing to offer a refund or replacement if you want to keep your customer happy. Happy customers are more likely to buy from you again and recommend you to others.

, When appropriate, consider following up with the customer after the transaction is complete. Doing so suggests that you genuinely care about the customer beyond his or her wallet.


If you've made an online sale, for instance, send an e-mail to the customer a few days after the product was due to arrive. Ask if the package arrived in good shape and if the product meets his or her needs.
For sales made in person, following up might not be necessary. You should make it easy for the customer to contact you again by providing business cards or by printing contact e-mail addresses and phone numbers on the sales receipt.

, Build on past success and correct past mistakes. Selling is a skill you'll need to continually improve if you want to survive in the broader marketplace.


Review your past successes. Ask yourself which tactics encouraged the customer to buy from you and include those in your future selling experiences.
Likewise, review your past failures. Try to identify things that drove the customer away and avoid making similar mistakes in the future.

Plan ahead.,
Create different pitches.,
Cater to your customer.,
Ask questions.,
Focus on the solutions.,
Address objections.,
Close the deal.,
Follow up.",How to Be a Good Salesperson1," Before you give a pitch, learn about your buyer and how your product can help that customer. Also identify the objective of your pitch. Do you want to make a sale? Do you want to introduce the customer to your company and start a relationship? Consider the amount of time you have to give your pitch as well.Appealing to your audience is the most important part of your pitch.
Write down your talking points and get some feedback from a friend, colleague, or family member. Try to find people who are similar to your target audience.;
, Your pitch will depend on the method you use to deliver. Prepare a pitch for in-person, phone, and elevator speeches. An in-person pitch is a formal presentation that you give to one or more people. Your phone pitch is for cold calling or following up with people who have expressed interest in your company. Your elevator pitch is for informal situations and should only last 30 seconds.Any pitch you give should include your name and the company name, the product you are selling, and how the product can help your customer.
Your pitch should have a beginning, middle, and end.
When you give an elevator pitch, be sure you have a business card with you since you are limited on time.

, A sales pitch is not one-size fits all. It must appeal to the needs of each customer. Think of who your customer is, what your product can do for them, and what other products you are competing with.For example, if you were selling a natural, organic cleaning product to a family with small children, you may emphasize how effective yet safe the product is for children. If you were selling this product to a young millennial, you may emphasize how the product is environmentally friendly.
For the family, you may say, âI think you will love this product. Safe and gentle products are really important to our company. We developed this with families and children in mind.â
For the millennial, you may say, âOur company is really concerned about making sustainable products that do not harm our environment. We are socially responsible just like our customers.â

, You do not always have time to research your customer. You can understand your customer by asking questions. Once you understand the customerâs needs and wants, you can tell them how your product is a solution.You may ask the customer:


About work or school
Their frustrations
Their goals
For example, if you were selling a computer, you may ask: What do you use your computer for? What do you like about your current computer? How would you improve your current computer?

, You may have the best product out there, but you must show how your product will help your customer. Instead of focusing on the specific qualities if your product, focus on how the product will help your customer.For example, instead of talking about the large hard drive and processing speed of the computer, you would talk about how your customer would be able to surf the web faster or save more pictures, videos, and music files.

, Think of some of the most common objections to the product that you are selling. Is it the price? Is it a new or unpopular product? Is the product similar to something else on the market? Write down the top 10 most likely objections and come up with a response.Practice your response to these objections before you pitch the product. Your response should be very natural.
Never ignore or discredit an objection. Say, âThatâs trueâ or âI completely understandâ to acknowledge their feelings.

, After you have addressed any objections, it is time to move the conversation forward. Do not expect the customer to close the deal. Here are some phrases you may try:âSo, when would you like to make your first purchase?â
âIf I can give you a discount today, would you be interested in purchasing?â
âBased on your needs, I think this product would work really well for you. Would you like to give it a try?â
âCan you commit to doing business with us today?â
âIf we can resolve the one issue you have with our product, would you be willing to a sign a contract in the next 2 weeks?â

, Your customer may not be ready to make a purchase. If your customer does not give you a firm âyesâ or âno,â tell them that they should think about it and you will follow up with them later. To follow up with a customer:Exchange contact information
Set a time period for follow up (e.g. 1 week, 2 days)
Do not give up until you get a final answer. Many sales are made during the follow up period.

, I really emphasize it. This does not mean you become a pest to a potential customer, instead keep adding the seeds for growth. Patience and nurturing of the seeds will flourish when done skillfully.

, Itâs OK to have the feelings that come with rejection but have them for a few minutes and then move on. Rejection is part of selling and we need to accept it. After a rejection plan a new strategy to go after that business. â This is when excitement kicks back in; we now have a new challenge.

, If you are enthusiastic about your product and/or selling, the enthusiasm will carry over to the customer. Youâve heard this from management and probably read it in books, I agree 100% - enthusiasm sells.

,, You walk away because the sell is turning into a lose-win situation and walking away may turn it back into a win-win by showing you are in control. Careful! One needs to feel a high level probability that the need for their product/service was sold.

, You must act based on logical business decisions.

, No one will know you were out of your zone unless you tell them.

Encourage your prospect to make decision.,
Follow through on potential sales.,
Stay in touch with clients.",How to Be a Successful Salesperson," You'll never succeed in sales, or in any job, if you don't love what you do. The best salespeople love the struggle of gaining sales leads, talking and listening to prospects, and closing the sale. Only by truly wanting to be there can you put in the extra work and effort required to be the best of the best. If you don't already love your job or the product you are selling, quit and sell something else. You may not make money initially, but your hard work will pay off eventually., Salespeople walk a delicate line between making a prospect realize that they need a product and trying not to be overly forceful. By being assertive, rather than aggressive or passive, in your statements and questions to prospects, you can move the conversation forward without making them angry or defensive. Assertive statements get your point across directly and clearly without threatening the prospect. For example:


A passive question would be, ""Is there any way you could let me know when we can meet again?""
An aggressive statement would be, ""You've got five seconds to make a decision before I walk out.""
An assertive statement would be, ""Let's meet again next week. Think about my offer and have a decision ready by then."", You should always be assessing what you're doing right and using that improving upon your sales process. The best thing you can do for yourself is to keep learning and improving over the years. You should read books related to sales, attend industry seminars, listen to podcasts, and follow famous salespeople who inspire you on social media. Immerse yourself in learning and your field and you will learn skills and new developments that you can use to further your own goals., Start by imitating the best salespeople at your company. What do they do? How do they talk to people? Ask them for tips and advice. Older salespeople, those close to retirement, are often very willing to help newcomers. You can also search for blog posts and seminars by highly successful salespeople and modify your behavior to match theirs., Even if the company you work for has set goals for you, set your own even higher. Work to be the best salesperson in your company. The competition will drive you to innovate and work harder. When you have success, set your goals even higher. Even when you think you've reached a plateau, you can always do at least a little bit better., There are several ways the beginning of a conversation with a prospect can go wrong. For one, many salespeople immediately launch into their ""elevator pitch"" without giving the prospect a chance at a real conversation. Others spend too long making small talk and force the prospect to ask why they are there. The sweet spot is right in the middle: tell your prospect in a few sentences who you are what business or company you represent. Don't talk about yourself or your product until you've had a chance to get to know the prospect., In recent years, salespeople have realized that the best way to draw a prospect into a sale is by asking questions rather than making statements or promises about a product. The truth is that people are resistant to being sold to. To make a sale, you instead have to ask your prospect questions until you can understand if and how you can help them. Start by asking them generic questions about their business or industry. Get to know what they care about., Slowly direct your questions towards assessing your prospect's problems. Is there something they wished was better about their business? Look for opportunities to ask about a problem they are having with a product similar to your own that they are already using. Ask them what they think could be changed to make it better. Again, don't make any promises or explanations about your own product yet. You still haven't convinced them of the need for a change.Try forcing the prospect to think about the problem further by suggesting that they consider what might happen if they don't solve their problem. What would be the cost in lost sales? What would they not be able to do?, During this whole process, you may find that your prospect is not responding adequately to your questions. Notice their behavior and body language. Are they looking away frequently or talking quickly? Do they seem upset in any way? If you see these signs, simply ask if a different meeting date would be more appropriate. Realize that your prospect may be having a busy or difficult day and respect that by giving them space., Once you've assessed your prospect's problems, compare them to what your product offers. Can you actually help them? If not, move on; you can't make a sale when the customer doesn't want or need your product. If you can help them, ask them what they would do if you solved their problem. Formulate your questions such that you draw them into wanting to know about how you plan to solve their stated problems., At this point, you can finally launch into an explanation of what exactly your product is, what it does, and how it can solve their problems. However, don't give them a full technical product description. Instead, focus on the parts that relate to their problem and business. They can usually get full information on your company's website if they need it, so don't worry about giving it to them here., When you've completed your explanation, ask the prospect if they have any questions. If so, answer them to the extent they demand. Once they are comfortable in their knowledge of the product and what it can do for them, ask them flat out if there is anything stopping them from moving forward with a purchase. At this point is where your true salesman tactics should kick in. Work to think critically about their situation and what kind of accommodations or solutions you could provide them., Don't ask them to decide directly, but rather coax them into making some sort of decision, whether that is meeting with your again for a demonstration or ordering a few units. If you need to, give them a few days to consider your offer and get back to you. Make sure you leave several different forms of contact information so that they can reach you easily., If you think that you have even the slightest chance of convincing a prospect to buy, keep contacting them. If the prospect asked for a week to think about your offer, call them in a week's time and ask for their thoughts. Spend the time in between thinking of better ways you might be able to help them or how you can convince them to buy., After a sale, your relationship with a client shouldn't just come to an end. Instead, you should work to maintain it so that you can gain return business from the client and also hopefully get referrals from them. Work on staying in touch by sending simple reminders to your clients, like birthday or anniversary cards or messages on social media. Other ideas include:


Sending clients informative articles relevant to their industry.
Crafting a newsletter to email to clients.
Scheduling get-togethers for coffee or lunch.
Finding creative ways to stay in touch that will stand out to clients."
"
Have empathy.,
Be responsible.,
Stay optimistic.,
Strive for excellence.",How to Be a Good Salesperson2," To sell a product, you must be able to feel what your customer feels and then adjust your sales strategy. While you may enter an interaction with a specific sales pitch, you must adjust your pitch if a customer is not responding as you hoped.Pay attention to your customerâs body language and facial expressions. If the customer is folding their arms, not making eye contact, or fidgeting a lot, you may need to try a different approach.


When you show empathy, acknowledge whatever concern the customer has and let them know that you are on their side.For example, if a customer is saying that your product is too expensive, you may say, âI understand that. I know that price is an important factor, and you are looking for the best value that suits your needs.â

, Do not blame other people when you are unable to make a sale or meet your numbers. If you have made a mistake, take responsibility and come up with a solution to the problem that you face. Also be open to any criticism or suggestions you receive about your work.For example, you should never say, âItâs not my fault that people arenât interested in the product.â Instead have the attitude that says, âWhy arenât people interested? What can I do to change my approach?â, As a salesperson, you will get turned down a lot. Think of rejection as just part of your job. Remember that the customer is not rejecting you as a person, but the product that you are selling.Think of rejection as an opportunity to try out a new strategy or go back to the drawing board.
Use your failures as a learning tool. Keep a written record of your sales approach and the associated outcome. This will help you figure out which strategies work best.

, Most successful sales people have an ego. They strive to be the best at what they do and are self-motivated. Set performance goals for yourself and do whatever it takes to meet them.For example, a goal may be to speak with 5 new customers a day or make a new sale once a week.
If you work on a sales team, try to be the top performer. If someone is doing better than you, try to step your game up.
Being competitive is good, but do not sabotage your coworkers or lie to customers to get the job done.

"
"
Know the benefits and features.,
Identify the price.,
Research the competition.",How to Be a Good Salesperson3," You should know your product better than anyone. What are the features of the product? How is this product helpful to customers?The features are the characteristics of the product.
The benefits are what the product will mean to your customer.

, Your product probably sells for a specific price. You may offer discounts or deals to get new customers or make a sale. Be clear about what type of deals you can offer and how low you can go.


It is important that you know the price options before you speak with a customer. You do not want to make an offer that you cannot stand by or get in trouble with your supervisor or company.

, Any product you sell will have competitors. You must know what your competitor is selling and how your product is different and/or better. If your customers bring up another product, you will be able to tell them why your product is better able to meet their needs. You should know:The price of the other products
How your product compares
How they reach out to your customers

"
"
Choose your strategy.,
Give a time deadline.,
Come prepared.,
Nurture a relationship.,
Smile and make eye contact.",How to Be a Good Salesperson4," There are three types of closing: hard, medium, and soft. Your closing strategy should be based on your intended outcome and your knowledge of your customer. Prepare a closing in each one of these categories.A hard close requires your customer to respond âyesâ or âno.â
A medium close is more of suggestion.
A soft close is a suggestion that makes the customer believe they are acting based on their own free will.
If you have an indecisive customer, you may starts with a soft close and then give them a hard close when you follow up. You may say, âWhy donât you think about what we discussed today, and I will give you a call Friday morning.â When you call Friday morning, you may say, âThe deal that we discussed is for a limited only. I need an answer today.â

, If you need an answer from a customer by a certain time period, give them a deadline to act. This is useful if you are offering special discounts or pricing or if you are trying to meet e deadline yourself. Try some of the following:Hard close: âThe special pricing ends this week. We need an answer today.â
Medium close: âThe discount is only running through the end of this month.â
Soft close: âThink about what you want to do, and I will give you a call tomorrow afternoon.â

, Have a pen, a note pad, and a hard copy of the proposal with you when you go to close the deal. The customer should be able to see in writing exactly what they are getting. You should always have your pen in case a customer is ready to sign on the dotted line.If you are not prepared and a customer is ready to close a deal, the customer may be turned off and change their mind.
Remember that you are representing your company. You need to look organized and trustworthy.

, Just because a customer is not interested in buying your product right now does not mean they will not be interested down the line. Work on developing a relationship with the customer to build trust. If a customer likes you personally, they are more likely to buy from you.Offer to take the person to lunch, dinner, or coffee. People are a little more relaxed outside of the office setting.
Send your customer an interesting article related to their business or personal interests. For example, if a person was interested in new farming equipment, you may send them a press release about a new product. You can simply send an email saying, âHi Ashley, take a look at this article. I think itâs something you may be interested in. Hope to speak with you soon.â

, When you make eye contact with a customer, you are saying that you are confident and interested in them. If you do not project confidence, the customer will not be confident in what you are selling. You should also smile and maintain a friendly attitude no matter what the customer says.This takes come practice. Practice smiling in all different situations. If someone is kind, irritating, annoying, smile through it.

"
"
Satisfy your customer.,
Listen.,
Give your full attention.,
Demonstrate your product/service's value.,
Know your field.,
Close.,
Build relationships with your customers.,
Create the impression of urgency.,
Flatter shamelessly (but subtly).,
Make customers feel obligated.,
Don't rush a sale.,
Be responsible and reliable.",How to Improve Your Sales," Above all else, try to keep your customer happy and satisfied. Humans aren't perfectly logical creatures - if someone likes you, they're more likely to buy from you, regardless of the deal you're offering. Be friendly, charming, and open with your customer. Give her peace of mind. Whatever your customer is looking for, that's what you should try to provide.


This applies both to your conduct and to the thing being sold. Not only should you be a customer's friend up to (and after) the point of the sale, you should do your best to convince the customer that whatever you're selling will give him exactly what he wants - that it will solve his problem, save him money in the long run, etc.;
, It's pretty difficult to satisfy a customer if you don't know what she wants - luckily, most of the time, all you'll have to do to figure this out is to simply listen. This isn't hard - at the beginning of your pitch, ask a customer what you can help with and let the customer describe her problem or desire. Once you know what she wants, you'll be able to decide which products, services, etc. best meet her needs.


Don't just listen to what a customer says - try to pay attention to how she says it in terms of facial expressions, body language, etc. If, for instance, a customer seems impatient or tense, you'll know that you can probably satisfy him by offering him a quick, easy solution to his problem, rather than giving him a lengthy sales pitch for your whole range of products.

, When a customer is considering making a purchase, you want to give the impression that you're available to fulfill any needs or answer any questions that may arise. You don't want to give the impression that you're distracted or that you're attending to your customer as an afterthought. Whenever possible, interact with customers on a personal, one-to-one basis, returning to your other duties only when the job is done.


This being said, try not to be an annoyance to customers. When you've gotten a sale, you can back off somewhat and allow your customer some breathing room. For instance, you might say something like, ""Great, I think you'll be happy with this purchase. I'll meet you at the register when you're ready!""

, When it comes to convincing a reluctant customer to make a purchase, flowery, glowing praise for your product or service is only going to get you so far. To really get the customer on your side, show your customer how the thing you're selling will make their life better. Whether it will save them money and time, give them peace of mind, or simply make them feel good, make sure your customer understands exactly how the item you're selling benefits him in real, practical terms.


This is a common sales tactic. For instance, car dealers let customers go on test drives and guitar salesmen let customers play on their instruments - even department stores let customers try clothes on before they buy them. If the thing you're selling is intangible or something you can't let customers touch before buying, think of another way to show customers its value. For instance, if you're selling solar panels, you might help customers estimate the savings they'll have on their electricity bill.
An old saying goes, ""Sell the benefit, not the product."" Focus on what your product or service allows your customer to do, rather than on the product itself.

, Customers like buying from salespeople who seem knowledgeable without being condescending. Be a friendly resource for your customer. Ideally, not only should you know the products and/or services you're selling like the back of your hand, but also those of your competitors. If you know this information, you'll be able to make comparisons that cast your product or service in the best light possible and your competitors' in a less favorable light. You'll also be able to intuitively recommend certain products based on your customer's unique situation.


For example, if you're selling televisions and you're approached by a single father wrestling to control 3 unruly children, you might want to use your knowledge of your products to recognize that a certain model has extensive parental control options and to use this information as a selling point.

, It's relatively easy to get a customer to like a product, but your commission ultimately depend on whether your customers buy your products, which is another matter entirely. Try to get a commitment from customers the same day you first meet them - a customer that leaves the store to ""think about it"" might not come back. If a customer is reluctant to make a purchase immediately, try to sweeten the deal - offer a minor discount or ""throw in"" extra bonuses in exchange for a customer's commitment.


Additionally, try to streamline the purchasing process so that it can be completed with a minimum of hassle. Accept multiple methods of payment, offer options for enrolling in an installment plan, and keep paperwork to a minimum. Not only will this make your customer's overall experience more positive, but it will also reduce the likelihood that customers will get cold feet before completing the process.

, Customers that feel that they've been respected and satisfied by a business are likely to give it a good review to their friends and may even return for future purchases. Building happy, respectful relationships with customers is a great way to give yourself a long-term sales boost. Try to genuinely connect with customers - when all's said and done, even if it can be tempting to think of customers as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet, remember that these are real people with real emotions and that nearly all of them appreciate human warmth.


After making a major sale, consider sending a quick note or making a phone call to make sure your customer's enjoying his or her purchase. This can give the impression of a friendly, personal relationship. However, don't overdo it - most customers will eventually want to be left alone.

, Most customers, whether they're conscious of it or not, hate the idea of missing out on a good deal. Giving the impression that, by passing on a sale, your customer is missing a special offer or a limited-time deal is one of the oldest, most effective tricks in the book for getting reluctant customers off the fence. To do this, try to call attention to certain deals that won't be offered forever or certain products that are almost out of stock and encourage customers to ""jump"" on these opportunities.


Some business even take this to a borderline-unethical extreme, increasing a product's price so that a big, appealing, limited-time deal reduces its price to normal levels. This sort of trickery is unfortunate, but, sadly, common.

, The stereotype of the salesperson as a slimy flatterer isn't entirely unearned - by playing to a customer's ego, you can increase your chance for success on almost any given sale. The trick here is to genuinely flatter your customer without seeming transparent, cloying, or phony. Pour on the honey, but don't overdo it: when your customer takes your exclusive deal on a new car, she's smart, not an absolute genius. When a heavy customer tries on a suit, he looks slim, not astoundingly dashing. Flatter, but be reasonable and realistic.


When in doubt, it's hard to go wrong by complimenting a customer's taste at having picked a certain product. A simple ""great choice!"" or ""ooh, nice!"" can work wonders.

, Most people are more likely to do things for others when the other person has already done them a favor. Particularly sly salespeople can take advantage of this fact by giving the customer the impression that they've received some favor or act of kindness. Sometimes, being attentive and responsive to a customer is enough - for instance, a shoe salesman who tirelessly runs back and forth from the storeroom so that a customer can try on a dozen pairs of shoes has demonstrated serious kindness simply by doing his job well. Other times, small ""actual"" favors are necessary, like getting a customer a drink or clearing time out of your schedule for an appointment.


For best results, make sure your efforts are noticed. For instance, if you have to schedule an appointment with your customer, pull out a schedule book and visibly cross out another appointment when you write theirs down.

, It's tempting, especially if your commission is on the line, to pressure a reluctant customer into a sale, rush him to the cash register, push him out the door, and forget about him. Obviously, this isn't a smart way to make sales. Customers don't like the idea that they're being tricked or swindled, so sales tactics that rely too heavily on making fast, high-pressure pitches can build hostility. Even if these tactics result in short-term sales gains, negative word-of-mouth can cause long-term downturns and tarnish your image.


The smartest salespeople present convincing pitches to the customer, then let the customer decide to buy the product, rather than pushing them to do it. While good salespeople do everything in their power to play up their product's benefits and minimize its downsides, they never attempt to actually make the decision for the customer.

, Other, slier sales techniques have their place, but if you do nothing else as a salesperson, try your best to have personal integrity. When you make a promise to a customer, deliver on it. When you make a mistake, offer a sincere apology. Respect is at the center of any sales transaction. Customers want to respect a salesperson enough to be confident they won't be swindled, salespeople want to respect customers enough to assume they'll get a good review for their hard work, and businesses want to respect customers enough to assume they'll be paid for goods or services rendered. When one of these respect-based relationships breaks down, sales suffer, so do your part and earn your customers' respect by being a respectable human being.

Get paid.",How to Become a Secret Shopper," Mystery (or ""secret"") shopping is a field full of untrustworthy companies trying to take advantage of trusting people. With a bit of Internet research, you'll get a good grasp of what companies are legit and which ones aren't.


For starters, never accept a gig that requires transferring money. Some places will send you to ""scope out Western Union"" or something similar and they'll issue you a false check. You'll transfer it, the bank catches up to you eventually, and you have to pay it off. No thank you.
In the US, you will not be asked any of your super-private (think SSN) information until you make $600 in one year from one company -- that's the mark when taxes start applying. If you do hit this, they'll send you a 1099 and everything will be confidential and official. Remember the IRS expects all income to be reported even if you do not receive a 1099. ;
, Very few people are mystery shoppers and only mystery shoppers. It generally pays between $8 and $10 per assignment (an assignment being 15 minutes to a couple hours), sometimes including a purchase.


The amount of gigs you get won't just depend on your availability -- it also depends on the amount of shops in the program and amount of secret shoppers in your area you have to compete with.
The assignments that require you to make hefty purchases (think at electronic stores) will give you a bit more for your inconvenience (you'll be purchasing the item out of pocket to be reimbursed later). But if you're being offered $30 a gig, it's probably a scam. Be wary.

, Mystery shoppers are independent contractors and therefore do not have benefits or guaranteed employment. While both will make you money, they are very different in the long-run.


If an individual is an employee, then any costs of workers' compensation, social security, and unemployment insurance, as well as federal income tax withholding and state income tax withholding are the responsibility of the employer.
If an individual is an independent contractor, these costs and tax withholdings are the contractor's, namely your responsibility. As long as you're prepared to keep good records, maintain your own health care needs, etc., you should be fine.

, Part of your responsibility as one is reading and understanding the Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) which is typically required upon registration with a company. Confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses are standard in these types of agreements, and they will also contain payment policies, dispute resolution policies, and other very important information. Read it, understand it, and be prepared to commit to it before you sign it.


If you'd rather someone else took care of such things, you're better off seeking a position as an employee. Further help can be sought from a reputable financial adviser or legal adviser. Local community organizations that specialize in consumer advice may be able to help you too.

, Legitimate companies will NEVER charge you a fee, ever, for any reason. You should never be asked to pay to obtain access to jobs, information, lists of companies, or training. Websites charging in this manner are obtaining the information from the free resources listed above and in many cases the information is outdated and/or altered by the time it reaches you via one of the ""pay to play"" websites.


Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. Even if it's $5 a month to access a list of assignments or companies, know that you don't have to do it. There are other ways around this.

, In order to make beaucoup bucks with this, you'll need to sign up with loads. Almost all of the mystery shopping companies have applications on their website. It's a good idea to begin with companies that are a member of the Independent Mystery Shoppers' Coalition, (IMSC), the only mystery shopper owned and managed association, Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA), International Association of Service Evaluators (IASE), or National Association for Retail Marketing Services (NARMS). You can always verify a company via the Better Business Bureau (BBB)if you're curious.


While not every legitimate company is a member of one or more of these globally recognized organizations, they are a good place to start. You can also find legitimate companies to work with at Mystery Shopping Solutionsand Volition .
Beyond that, there are many mystery shopping related groups, forums, meetups, and communities, ie., Market Research Pros on Facebook and Google Plus , and dozens of Yahoo! Groups . You can also do a search for ""Mystery Shopping Companies"" or ""Mystery Shopping Provider"" to find additional companies. Just be sure to verify companies before shopping for them or providing personal information. , All of this is done on your own time, so you'll need a few things to meet your deadlines and be a reliable shopper. The following things will keep the assignments coming:


A reliable computer with Internet access. You'll be doing all of your ""clocking in"" via computer by submitting surveys and working on your company's website. You'll also be uploading photos and whatnot, so take into account your internet speed.
Reliable transportation to get to each assignment. In most cases, your gas and transportation expenses will not be covered.That's why you stick to your immediate area!
The proper attire each assignment calls for. Most are casual but some shops are in upscale restaurants, apartments or retail outlets and you will need to dress the part to blend in.
A way to record your experiences. If you're hitting up a cafe for a to-go drink, you may not need to write down your experience while you're there. But if you're sitting down at a nice restaurant for a couple of hours, by the time you get home you'll have forgotten how the meal started. Bring a tablet with you, your smartphone, or a notepad that can masquerade as something else (you don't want to be obvious!).






A camera. Some assignments will require you to take pictures during your experience. You will also have to send these in, so if you're working with a digital camera (though a phone is better), you'll need the connecting cord, too.

, You will soon have many shopping assignments, and if you keep track of them from the very beginning, you will do a better job. You'll feel more in control and be able to take on more assignments. Use whatever means that work for you â computer, PDA or a simple notebook will do. Some mystery shoppers develop spreadsheets to help with organization, and there are many apps and tools that can assist with organization, like Notepad, Sticky Notes, Evernote, Google Docs, and OneNote.Make it a simple system. Include columns for company name, scheduler or company contact (companies can have multiple schedulers working on the same project), shopping assignment name, assignment location/address, due date, shopper fee and paid date. You might also like a comment column, to remind you of any particular issues, ie., requirements for receipt and photo uploads, date range or specific date/time when a shop can be completed, reporting or formatting preferences, etc., that you may experience.

, Save it in a Word document, email draft, or note taking program. Include writing samples, and lists of cities and zip codes where you are willing to shop. This time-saving tip will help a great deal. There are hundreds of legitimate mystery shopping companies, and most shoppers will register with 50 or more companies and actively work with up to 25 at any given time. Having this standard profile will make it easy for you to fill out the forms and to know whether or not a particular company is the right fit for you. For example:


Keep a list of all the zip codes you are willing to shop. You can then just copy and paste this info into the application.
Keep a sample of your writing in this file. Most companies will want you to provide them with a paragraph or two describing a recent shopping experience you have had. This is to make sure you know how to write, spell properly and are proficient at grammar and punctuation! Everything counts here, as it is the only way you can show them that you can do the job well and reliably. When the time comes to fill out applications, you can just copy and paste these paragraphs into the form.

, This is a form or file on your computer of all the mystery shopping companies that you have signed up with, along with your user name and password. You'll need it when you're working with piles and piles of them.


Make a column for notes to keep track of anything out of the ordinary that each company requires. While this may be a lot of work now, you'll be thankful in the future when you can't distinguish company 3 from company 49875A3F.

, It's just like any other job search -- they're not going to come knocking on your door while you sit on the couch eating Doritos. It's not at all uncommon for a scheduler to call a shopper and offer an assignment, but this should never be expected. It's simply not possible for schedulers to call each and every shopper.


When the time comes to begin your first assignment, record it into your log, print out the instructions for the shop from the companyâs website and print the form that you will need to fill out about your experience. You will actually fill out the form online in most cases, but it's important to review those report forms ahead of time so that you know the questions in advance and can find the answers as you shop. It's never fun to have to scramble for information, and you may have to repeat the shop at your own expense if you've forgotten something critical.

, You may need to make a purchase (out of your own wallet) for an assignment, so before you accept it, make sure you have the cash. If not, then look for the many shops that don't require a purchase, like banking inquiry shops, telephone mystery shops, parking shops, pricing audits, and theater checks. You can also find in-store demonstrations and merchandising assignments that don't require an out of pocket purchase. Many companies that offer mystery shopping will also offer these other types of assignments.


Mystery shopping often requires you to buy something, and with the delay in pay and factoring in variables such as gas, you may find it not worth doing that shop. Some companies will offer a ""bonus"" or ""travel incentive"" to compensate for gas mileage, while others do not. This is where routing can make the difference between a profitable mystery shopping trip and one that you didn't feel was worth your time. Choose carefully.

, Each assignment will have its own requirements and each business may have their own set of unique protocol. Some key things include:


Follow the directions of the assignment to the letter. If the directions say, ""Purchase a small drink"" do not order a large one, or you may not be paid!
Pay attention to every detail -- including names of every employee you come in contact with, what they are wearing and what the products are like. Forgetting details could result in not being reimbursed.
Always take notes after each assignment, especially if you are visiting more than one place. The last thing you want is forgetting details or confusing them. Companies will ""reject"" reports if they suspect this has occurred. Make every report its own individual story by providing details that are unique to that location and experience, and make sure that there is no overlap in your narratives (description of events) between one shop and another.

, When choosing appropriate attire for an assignment, remember that your role as a mystery shopper is to ""blend in."" Flashy attire and accessories may result in ""shopper detection."" Think of the average customer of the shop you're going to -- what might they wear or where are they coming from?


Generally, you'll be given tasks according to your demographic. If you're a 25-year-old female, they probably won't send you to a bait and tackle shop. This makes it a lot easier to just be yourself and use your own wardrobe.

, If you walk into a camera shop and you ask for, ""Err...the black one..."" but then rattle off some info about the current camera market and your specific still life photography needs, red lights are going to be flashing everywhere. Don't be obvious. You're just shopping. Don't think of it as pulling the wool over their eyes.


There will be times when things get awkward. You may have to ask several people their names and feign interest in something you wouldn't be caught dead using. Try to think of it as just a fun experience to widen your world. Be calm. Be cool. You're just shopping.
When you're taking notes, be discreet. The second you whip out a note pad, the service will be on you like a pack of blood-hungry hounds. While you may get served faster, you're creating an inorganic, unnatural environment. Don't let them know what you're up to. You want to see how the business normally runs.

, The task needs to be done at a certain time, so it's imperative that you fit it into your schedule. In addition, make sure your assignment is submitted well before your deadline, including written reports, receipts, and uploading media, like photos. If you miss your deadline, some companies will delete you from their system automatically.


If you are having a particular challenge make sure to reach out to your scheduler or company contact to request an extension, if possible. Some companies will offer you the chance to reschedule instead of cancelling. However, their clients give them specific days the tasks must get done and they may not be able to work with you.

, In general, mystery shopping companies are looking for people that have good grammar and punctuation, but that also are detail-oriented and can express themselves clearly. They also need to be very prompt and thorough!


Check spelling, punctuation and grammar. There are many free spelling and grammar check tools. Many shoppers find it easy to do a quick spelling and grammar check by copying and pasting their narratives into a Word document (though know that this isn't always 100% correct). This serves two purposes, because after completing the spell/grammar check, you can save that document to retain a copy of your narratives. This can come in handy and save you a lot of time if you have a power surge, connection issue, or get timed out on a reporting server. It's also important to retain this information in case questions come up later.

, Know if the company wants greetings and closings in a direct quote fashion or if the preference is for paraphrasing. Do you have to write in first person, singular narrative or from a third person, objective perspective? Does the company wants the associates' names used in the narrative, or do they not want names used at all? Sometimes clients prefer their employees to be called, ""associates,"" ""sales professionals"" or some other designation. These reports are for the clients, so adhere to those policies and preferences.


Your objective as a shopper is simply to report the objective factual data in many cases. However, some companies will ask for opinions or ""feeling statements"" (ie., ""She answered the phone abruptly and spoke so quickly that I wasn't sure I had called the right place. She spoke in a disinterested tone of voice, and I felt rushed. This made me feel unimportant. I did not feel valued as a potential customer"").

These instructions are just as important as the shop instructions and may also include formatting preferences, media upload requirements and instructions (ie., receipts and photos), or the company's preferences in providing descriptions. This information should be available in the instructions for the shop, commonly referred to as ""shop guidelines.""



, Schedulers and editors like to work with people they can trust to turn in a quality product, and you will get more assignments by doing the very best job you can each and every time. There is no need to make your experience more remarkable -- regardless of how it goes, you'll still get paid the same amount of money.


In general, each company has a representative working within an area. You may have actual interact with the company -- so be on your best behavior. You're not just some computer generated survey-taker.

, If you are having a particular challenge, make sure to reach out to your scheduler. Generally speaking, there is a 24 hour turn-around. However, some clients of your company may require it by the next morning -- either way, there's little time for dilly-dallying!, Though it all depends on the company and the assignment, you should receive payment (via check or PayPal) within a few weeks' time.If you do regular work, you'll end up with a paycheck two times a month. However, it may take one to three months to get that paycheck.Keep track of this! Legalities may arise, so it's best to have complete records. Once you start making major moolah, you'll have to think about taxes, so keep everything as organized as possible.

Read up on the different sources and fermentation processes associated with various types of wine, and learn about the vintages and pairings that people tend to prefer. Pay special attention to local wines, if this exists in your area.


Subscribe to periodicals like âWine Spectatorâ and âDecanterâ to keep up with current trends in wine. Wine magazines such as these feature reviews from established critics, interviews with wine makers and restaurateurs, trends in wine making, and âbest ofâ lists that highlight popular vintages to look for.Books that survey the wine world can also be great sources of information. For instance, âThe Oxford Companion to Wineâ is a respected authority on just about everything related to wines, wine making, regional variants, grape varieties, and more.;
, By joining a tasting group, you will have the opportunity to expose yourself to wines from different regions on a regular basis and find out how they are made. Tastings can also be a good place to learn about which wines pair well with which foods. You can find a tasting group near you by searching onlineTake advantage of your tasting meetings by asking as many questions as possible of the hosts. This is a great way to learn some insider facts about the wines and wineries you come into contact with. Distribute business cards to winery managers or hosts; these individuals could become professional contacts later on.
Take a notebook with you on tasting tours so you can record your impressions and things you learn throughout the experience. Do not do this if your tasting guide states that it is not allowed.

, On your store visits, take the time to find out what they stock. In restaurants, examine their wine lists and ask your server for details about those you are unfamiliar with. You can learn a lot by understanding what is on a wine list and why.


Purchase a range of wine varieties at a range of price points. As a wine sales rep, you will be selling wines of every caliber and should become knowledgeable on cheap wines, as well as the rare and expensive ones.
Take note of which types of wines are commonly found with specific restaurant themes. You might even want to create a spreadsheet so you can easily cross-reference wine types and see what food styles they tend to go with.

, Unless you already have a degree in viniculture or a related subject, enroll in classes at your local community college on subjects relevant to wine and winemaking. While not all colleges offer classes on these topics, many do. These classes tend to be popular with adult hobbyists, so they are often offered at night and on the weekends. Check with your local college for options.These classes can provide you with fundamental knowledge about winemaking culture and the processes behind growing grapes and producing wine. Even if you know a great deal already about wine flavors and vintages, you will benefit as a wine sales rep by understanding the work that goes into producing the wines you sell.
If you do not live near a college offering viniculture classes or can't fit them into your schedule, look into online course options. Many of these are available through colleges and universities, but can also be found on the Viticulture and Enology Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA) website., Many wine sales rep jobs require a couple of years of experience selling wine in a specific market. While knowledge of wine is important, you should also be able to navigate the network of restaurateurs and distributors in your region. It is immensely helpful to have hands-on experience in the industry when seeking and filling a wine sales rep position.


To get an entry level wine rep job, experience in the restaurant industry can help - whether as a manager, server, or bartender. You might also seek positions at wineries, even if they are not related to wine sales. Working at a wine shop is also a good way to get a feel for how the business works as you build your knowledge of wine culture.
Working in the industry in some capacity before transitioning to wine sales rep is also a great way to build relationships with potential future customers and get to know your region's big players.

, As with most careers, there are certain qualifications you must meet in order to be a wine sales rep. Many of these are not so much prerequisites for being hired, but qualities or traits you should possess in order to succeed. Examples include:Possession of a valid driver's license and clean driving record. This is often required because wine sales reps must travel frequently (to and from restaurants and wineries, for example) in the course of their normal work.
Ideally, you should be able to lift about 50 pounds (or about 23 kg) so you can easily tote around boxes and crates of wine when necessary. Alternatively, you should have some other means of doing this.
A wine sales rep should be self-motivated, enthusiastic, and outgoing. If you do not enjoy schmoozing and working with people, you probably will not enjoy a career as a wine sales rep. You will need to build relationships in order to make sales and earn commission., If you have been working in the wine industry already (at a winery, bar, restaurant, or wine shop), you should have a few contacts that can put you in touch with people looking to hire wine reps. Reach out to your contacts to ask about job opportunities instead of waiting to hear of something. For example:


Speak to a current wine rep who serves the restaurant, bar, or shop where you work.
Ask the manager of the winery where you work if he can set you up with an interview as soon as a wine rep position comes available.
Contact the wine distributor who sells your winery's product to restaurants and stores.

, Many wine distributors and producers advertise job openings on mainstream job search engines such as Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, etc. Create a profile on one or more of these sites and use keyword searches and location filters to see if there are any wine sales rep openings in your area.


Use fairly broad search terms so you are sure to see all relevant positions. For example, instead of searching for ""wine sales rep,"" try just searching ""wine.""
Upload a resume to your profile and make it visible to employers. This will open up the possibility of a recruiter contacting you directly if they think your goals and qualifications are suitable for their available position.

, The wine sales rep world revolves around interpersonal relationships and face-to-face interaction. Show up to the winery or distribution office you'd like to work for and ask to speak to the manager about employment opportunities. This will create a much better impression on your potential boss than an email or job application form ever could.


Practice your sales technique by selling yourself to the people who might hire you. They want to see that the people who represent them to their clients are competent and likable. Convince them that you are the right person to do the job.
Always bring a resume and business cards with you when visiting a potential employer. If you are not able to meet with the manager in person, leave the resume with a secretary or assistant. Some wine sales reps must have specific education and experience in order to be hired, so show them you are qualified right off the bat.

, If you are called for an interview, prepare by thinking about how you want to present yourself to the interviewers. Since you are applying to be a salesperson, it is important to show that you are personable, articulate, and knowledgeable about the product you will be selling.


Study the wines sold by the company you want to work for. You could very well be quizzed on specific details about the wines you would be selling, so you should go into the interview with as much knowledge as possible.
Brush up on details about the company you are interviewing with. Things to know include the name of the owner(s) and CEO/president, the year the company started, its general product line (including grape varieties and significant vintages), and who its major local clients are.

, As a sales person, a large part of your job will be making cold calls to restaurateurs and other potential clients to maintain steady business. A network of repeat customers takes time to build, so at first you may have to make unsolicited phone calls (and visits) to restaurants in order to break into the market.


Most of the time, actual sales will take place during in-person meetings. Sales calls function to keep existing clients well-stocked on their wine supply and to set up meetings with potential new clients.You may find that some clients are difficult to get in touch with over the phone. For this and other reasons, it is usually better to visit restaurants and stores in person to speak to the decision makers face-to-face.

, If you work as a sales rep for a specific winery, then a big part of your job is to market that winery's brand. Promotional events can be particularly effective ways of doing this and attracting new customers. Promotions can be held at wine and liquor stores, at restaurants, or at events such as festivals. Note that depending upon the event and location, special permits and permissions may be required in order to promote alcoholic beverages.


Research exists to show the sorts of promotions that tend to be most effective in promoting wine sales. In general, offering specific recommendations and free tastings appear to be the most effective strategies for boosting sales.If you work for a wine distributor, your promotional deals are more likely to involve discounted bulk purchases for restaurant or liquor store clients.

, This job task might be performed as part of a winery tour (if you are a sales rep for a specific brand) or as a special event at a restaurant, wine bar, or retail store. Such events are usually not led by inexperienced wine sales reps, as a great deal of knowledge and expertise is usually required to ensure that any patrons' questions can be adequately addressed.


Find out from your employer or senior wine sales reps at your company what is involved in organizing a wine tasting event.
Remember that the purpose of a tasting is to generate business. Do not be afraid to turn up the salesmanship where appropriate in order to win over customers.

, If you have restaurant clients, ask to set up training sessions with the wine servers there in order to teach them about the wines they will be selling to restaurant patrons and demonstrate proper serving techniques. You might also wish to go over the restaurant's menu with the servers and identify appropriate pairings.


This is something you should do as a wine sales rep regardless of your type of employer. Both winery and distributor reps sell to restaurants, so plan to conduct training sessions like these.
You will need to obtain permission from your employer and restaurant management before setting up a server training event. The client will likely need several weeks notice in order to put the word out to all of its servers and ensure high attendance.

, Some wine sales reps are in charge of their own marketing (to an extent). Requirements and restrictions will vary by employer, but the most common modern marketing technique for expanding brand recognition is the use of online tools such as social media. You should expect to maintain a constant online presence for your brand(s) in order to effectively take advantage of digital marketing.


Millennials currently account for a huge portion of wine market expansion, so individuals of that age group (people in their twenties or early thirties) are a valuable target for marketing strategies and campaigns. Data suggests that millennials can most easily and effectively be reached via social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, for example).If your employer provides you with a marketing budget, consider advertising on popular websites that are likely to see lots of traffic. These online ads can be effective, but you might have to coordinate with your company's advertising department (if applicable) to assist you with an undertaking like this.
Don't discount the value of advertising via traditional media. Flyers, billboards, and mail circulars may also be good ways to drum up business.

You will use stakes, flags, and other markers, as well as special measuring equipment. Once you have collected the data, you will then punch the information into a computer. This information can then be accessed by cartographers, engineers, and construction companies.As a surveyor, you are part of a larger process and your primary role is to collect geographic data that will be utilized by other experts in the field. You will also need to have excellent math skills and be confident with recording data with accuracy and clarity. You should be able to clearly see distance and size in a landscape.
You will often be working with other surveyors or in a team, so you also need to be able to work and communicate effectively with others.;
, Surveying is a primarily an outdoor job and requires lots of time spent navigating outdoor environments. This means you will need to be prepared for adverse or harsh weather conditions and lots of walking and standing for extended periods of time. You will also need to carry heavy equipment through rough weather and terrain.Occasionally, you may need to travel quite a far distance and stay overnight to access certain sites. However, you can also be an office-surveyor, where you spend more time in the office preparing incoming data from surveyors in the field.The pay scale for surveyors averages $57,000 a year or $27 an hour. Most surveyors are paid a stable salary wage for their work and receive employee benefits, especially if they work with a large surveying firm. A complete list of average salary for surveyors by state can be found here: http://www.environmentalscience.org/career/surveyor-cartographer.

, Surveying is expected to grow by 10% in the next 10 years, and is considered an in demand career. Many surveyors work for private engineering or mapping companies, as well as state and local government agencies.This also means that job opportunities in surveying will continue to grow as there will be a continued need for construction surveying and engineering surveying as the countryâs infrastructure continues to expand and grow.

, To be a surveyor, you must earn your high school diploma or GED equivalent. Though some surveying companies only require a high school diploma, many companies are starting to look for candidates that also have additional training in survey technology and geography as well.If you enjoyed geometry and trigonometry in high school, land surveying may be right for you. You should also take courses in algebra, drafting, computer aided drafting (CAD), and geography in high school to better prepare for the surveyor role., Due to the growing technical nature of surveying, many employers now require a bachelorâs degree in surveying, mapping, or geomatics. These degree programs often include courses in calculus, geographic information systems (GIS), and cartography.Some states may also require you to complete a degree program that is approved by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

, Depending on what state you are planning to work in as a surveyor, you may or may not need to get a license to become a surveyor. However, no matter what state you plan to work in, you will need to take the Fundamentals of Surveying exam, which is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).Once you pass this test, you can begin hands on training under the supervision of a licensed surveyor. This hands on training usually lasts about two years.
After you have completed the required work experience, you can take the Principles and Practice of Surveying exam, also administered by the NCEES. Some states may also require you to take a state licensing board exam and continuing education courses to maintain your license in the state.

, To gain more hands on experience, you may want to consider doing an internship during the summer with a surveyor company while you are still in school. Working with a survey crew every day will allow you to get a better sense of the expectations of the role and make connections with individuals in the field.

, There are several professional societies that focus on building the careers of its members and promoting new survey methods, including the National Society of Professional Surveyors (NSPS) and the Imaging and Geospatial Information Society (ASPRS). These surveyor associations can be great opportunities for networking, connecting, and learning more about the profession.More information on the National Society of Professional Surveyors (NSPS) can be found on their website. More information on the Imaging and Geospatial Information Society (ASPRS) can be found on their website.

, If you are fresh out of school, you may want to start by applying for entry-level surveyor positions with surveyor companies in your area or state. Look for surveyor companies that work in an industry you are interested in getting involved with and that have a strong sense of mentorship and learning. You will be working closely with more experienced surveyors and this can be a good learning opportunity as you progress in your career.You should prepare a resume that lists your key skills and your education as well any relevant hands on experience you have. You should also note if you belong to any surveyor associations, as this will show you are active in the community and are interested in expanding your knowledge of the field.
In your job interviews, you should highlight your key skills like your strong math and science skills, you ability to process surveyor data and your ability to work well in groups or with a team. It's important that you display confidence in your knowledge of the position but that you also indicate you are opening to learning and expanding your existing skills.

Include lists of sources for all of your data so can refer back to them as needed.
Create an organized filing system and naming conventions for your files so you can access them as needed.;
, Learn about the product inside and out, and strive to keep abreast of any new developments. Ask questions and read all available literature. Train yourself on the use of the product if appropriate. Learn the features of your product or service and the potential benefits to your specific customer. Don't rely on jargon or buzzwords to describe your business. Rather, assume your client has no prior knowledge about your company, and be prepared to discuss it in detail.Take care to distinguish between features and benefits. A product or service can have many features, many of which are not important to a prospective customer. The salesman's task to show how a specific feature will have a meaningful benefit to the prospect.
For example, features may include cost, size, usability, lack of maintenance, easy repair, or warranty, among others.
Have an exhaustive understanding about how the product is manufactured and packaged.
Know the history of your product and learn about any advances in product development.
Familiarize yourself with shipping procedures and policies.
Study the history of your company and how it has grown, and be prepared to discuss your company's values.
For services, identify important features and benefits like peace of mind, security, cost, ease of use, etc.

, Understanding who you're up against will make your presentation more meaningful. It will allow you to respond to questions and objections about how your company can better meet the needs of your prospective customer. If your prospect is already working with your competition, identify key differences that set you apart. These differences can be either product/service based or company-based. If required, a salesperson can distinguish themselves from other salespeople. Compel your customer to invest in you because of the higher value you offer.To beat a competitor, first try to determine their competitive advantage. That is, why customers buy their products rather than yours. Again, it is not the features that count but the perceived benefit that the customer expects to receive from the purchase.
Scrutinize the details of their product or service and how yours compares. If you are a caterer, for example, determine if you use fresher food or better ingredients, or if you prepare food in a unique way.
Learn their marketing and communication strategies and how they differ from yours. Perhaps you offer special discounts that they do not, or your printed materials are in full color and are printed on higher quality paper.

, To argue convincingly about the potential benefit you offer, you need an exhaustive understanding of your customer's products, services and clients. Learn how long they have been in business. Assess how adequately they meet their customer's needs. Know whether your competition is currently selling to them.Learn your potential customer's needs. If you can, talk to them before you pitch (by phone or in person) and learn as much as you can about what will really make them interested in buying. Do they need a lower price, better reliability, finance terms, faster delivery? Try to figure out their ""trigger.""
Consult the company's annual report, trade publications, website and the local chamber of commerce to learn this information., Characterize their target customers and what their expectations are. Identify their key challenges in meeting their clients' needs. Assess how you can help them to be more competitive.


Analyze their business and current economic indicators to determine if their product and services are in demand. A food services distributor, for example, could help a coffee shop improve their menu with new equipment or better ingredients.
Determine their biggest competitors and the benefits the competitor provides to the customer.To get a sale, you will need to offer a better benefit than what they might be receiving.
Consult trade groups, business magazines and academic institutions to learn about business trends and how your prospect could use your services to be more competitive., Once you've written your presentation, adjust your delivery style to match the expectations of your audience. Find out whether you will be presenting to a large or small audience. Speaking to a large group, a small group, or an individual is entirely different, and the amount of interaction necessary is directly proportional to the size of the audience. Tweak the length of your presentation, your presentation tools, and the amount of visual aids to deliver your message most effectively.Shape your presentation to the power-level of attendees in the meeting. Are they decision-makers, influencers, or gate-keepers? Understand (ask if you don't know) the process for making a purchase decision and who will be making it.
If the audience will be small, deliver a short, interactive presentation and then lead a discussion. Ditch the Powerpoint and instead try printing out a few detailed slides to pass out to the small group.Keep in mind the importance of body language and eye contact with your audience.
For a large audience, prepare a staged, formal presentation with polished visuals. Avoid distracting colored text or ClipArt. Use clear language, show enthusiasm for your product, and keep things moving at a lively pace., Whether you're planning a formal presentation for a large audience or an interactive meeting with a small group, write out every detail of your presentation in advance. This guarantees that no important information will be left out. An ad-lib presentation lacks structure, appears disorganized and confuses the audience with repeated or omitted information., Confirm your prospective customer's need (which you determined before the presentation) and how your company can help. State your understanding of the customer's objectives and get an affirmative response before proceeding. Then, detail how your product or service fills their needs, and repeat this constantly during the presentation. Discuss your company's history and what sets you apart (but only if this information will give you an advantage). Lay the groundwork for the rest of your presentation and create a compelling argument for why your prospect needs you.Use simple, short terms for more punch. Try using action verbs when possible.
A caterer pitching to a wedding planner, for example, would discuss their proven history of providing high quality food at a reasonable price.
A cleaning service presenting to an office manager would state that they can enhance employee productivity by keeping the office clean and organized.

, List all of your key tasks. Give an overall time-frame for the delivery or completion of all of your objectives. Be ambitious but honest about what you can deliver. Earn your customer's trust by providing realistic goals.Your opening should include a restatement of their objectives and the assurance that you will meet those objectives during the presentation.
A caterer's objectives, for example, would include planning a menu, ordering food, preparing food and arranging for delivery within a given time-frame.
A cleaning service would list daily tasks, such as cleaning the floor, sanitizing bathrooms and removing the trash. Less regular tasks, such as cleaning the windows or equipment dusting, would also be listed with the expected frequency.

, Provide details about how much time you need for each step. Include the results the customer can expect to see at the conclusion of a step. List deliverables, or tangible objects, the customer will receive at different intervals throughout the project.The steps for planning a menu, for example, might include meeting with clients and setting up taste tests. The deliverable would be a written copy of the menu.
The details a cleaning service would specify include how long it takes to complete tasks, the materials and number of personnel used and whether or not they bring their own equipment.

, Be as meticulous as possible. Disclose information about all potential costs so the customer knows exactly what to expect. Prepare detailed spreadsheets that fully explain the costs involved., This is not the time to be modest. Withhold no information about how valuable you are. Explain how your product or service can help the customer overcome their key challenges.A caterer would use this opportunity to emphasize their skill at timing food preparations so everything is perfectly cooked and doesn't get cold before it is eaten.
A cleaning service would highlight the positive impression that a clean, organized space makes on clients and how this also maintains property values.

, Find out the timeline for the sales process, if it is appropriate. You should have already learned the process and who will make the buying decision. If you are with the decision maker, ask. If it is a gate-keeper or expert who will make recommendation, find out when and to whom. Confirm that no other information is needed to make a decision. If other information is required, write down what is needed so that you can provide it., If your slides look like nothing more than your speaking notes, then you shouldn't even use them. A list of bullet points not only bores the audience, but it also reduces the likelihood that they will remember what you said. Pictures communicate messages more clearly than written text or even the spoken word.Find fresh graphics instead of using stock ClipArt or templates. If the budget permits, enlist the help of a graphic artist.

, If you are selling a product, have a model available for your customers to see. Allow them to interact with the product as you discuss its features and benefits. If you can't bring the product, bring a video or photographs., Not only are they noisy and unreliable, but the projector obscures the screen for some audience members. If you must use them, arrange the room so everyone can see the screen and speak audibly to be heard over the motor. If at all possible, opt for digital presentation tools.


Make sure you check the visual aids and sound equipment that might be available in the venue, and find out the requirements for use.

, If appropriate, use a whiteboard and record comments. Write neatly and legibly, and make your letters large enough that all audience members can easily see them. Use black or blue for writing since other colors may be difficult for others to see. Take notes as necessary, but limit the amount of time spent with your back to the audience.If a smart board is available, use it to annotate graphics with your customer's feedback. Save your annotations at the end of your presentation so you can review them later.
Bring a flip chart or whiteboard and an easel for taking notes and recording comments if an interactive smart board is not available. Test your markers ahead of time and only bring those that work. If your paper is unlined, draw lines with a pencil to keep your handwriting horizontally aligned.

, Share them at the beginning only if the presentation contains complicated charts or graphics, which may be easier for audience members to read in a handout than on a screen. Save handouts with relevant summaries of key information for the end of the presentation. Otherwise, audience members may read the handout instead of listening to you.You would only distribute them if you are not talking to a decision maker who is not ready to make decision.
Be aware that anything left with the client may wind up in the hands of a competitor.

, Commit it to memory so you need only glance at your notes. Practice your mannerisms, enunciation, and the pitch and volume of your voice.Record yourself or go through the presentation with a friend or colleague in order to identify areas that need improvement.Avoid slang and jargon and never, ever curse.

, Smile and shake hands when entering a room. Make eye contact and address people by name. Stand up straight with your shoulders back. Wear the appropriate clothes and be sure your shoes are polished. Keep your hands out of your pockets and don't fidget during quiet moments.If you are giving a presentation to a very large audience, don't just stand on the stage as people file in. Mill about, introducing yourself and greeting people you know.

, Practice working with a smart board or with a laptop and projector so you can troubleshoot any problems ahead of time. If necessary, bring your own equipment with you. If possible, set up all technology in advance on the day of the presentation., Go through your presentation and write down any potential questions or objections on a separate piece of paper. Ask a friend or colleague to role play as the customer and ask questions or raise objections that you did not anticipate. Draft answers to all possible objections and be prepared to deliver them., Pause for questions where appropriate. Watch body language that indicates your audience doesn't understand something. Maintain your energy and enthusiasm throughout the presentation. Try to control the meeting by announcing when questions will be taken. This can help you to avoid interruptions at a critical time. Recognize, however, if you are speaking to a decision maker, you might not have a choice., Ask if you have the authority to proceed with the order. Request a signature on an order form. Confirm delivery and invoice addresses. These actions communicate that you expect to receive the customer's business., Use customer objections as an opportunity to explain a benefit your product or service provides. If a customer raises an objection about the price, for example, discuss the added value you provide with higher quality materials or craftsmanship. A caterer might respond by discussing their use of organic, local produce for better taste and freshness, or extra staff for more efficient food preparation. Be careful, however, not to contradict the customer or dismiss their concerns., Examples include flexible payment schedules or expedited delivery. If necessary, offer compromises to help you close the deal. For example, if you normally charge for delivery, but the customer has an objection to price, consider offering free delivery in order to make the sale. , If you sense that the customer is not yet ready to commit, show you are serious about doing business by scheduling a follow-up meeting or phone call. Schedule that follow up before you leave the office. Otherwise you risk never hearing from that customer again., Prepare open-ended questions that assess your customer's interest. Ask how your product or service can benefit the customer or whether you haven't covered something that is important to them. Take notes so you can adequately respond to the customer's comments."
"
Share your love of the product.A good salesperson believes in the product that is being sold, and transfers this enthusiasm to the customer.,
Anticipate your customersâ motivations.. You want to be able to answer any questions that customers may have about a product, but even more importantly, you want to anticipate those questions.,
Practice breaking the ice with customers.,
Convert the customer's motivations into the product's characteristics.,
Be honest about your product.,
Close the sale.,
Give customers time to consider.",How to Sell a Product2," There are numerous ways to show your love of a product.


Donât neglect body language and tone. You will convey energy and enthusiasm if you speak clearly about a product, and show expression when discussing it. On the other hand, if you mumble when customers ask questions about a product, or cross your arms over your chest, then it will appear like you are distant and donât care about the product.
Be prepared to discuss how you use the product, or how other satisfied customers have. Specific stories about the product make it relatable to customers. For instance, if youâre selling a shampoo, you can tell a customer something like: âMy hair is usually so frizzy, but ever since Iâve started using this itâs been as smooth and straight as it is right now.â

, This shows that you understand customer needs. Make sure that you are able to connect emotionally with customers by addressing those needs.Think about your typical customers. What motivates them? What needs do they have? Are they young? Single? Wealthy? Do they have families?
Once you have an idea of your customers in mind, think about how your product can help them meet their needs or reach their desires.

, If you are working in direct sales, the way you connect with people is critical. Instead of asking the close-ended question ""May I help you?,â ask the more positive, open-ended questions like ""Are you looking for something for yourself? Or a gift for someone special?""In addition, be ready to make remarks about your product that will interest customers and start deeper conversations. For instance, if you are in clothing retail, you might say: âYou know, ugly Christmas sweater parties are really popular right now. Have you ever been to one?â

, In marketing, this is known as ""positioning,"" and it consists of equating the product with the customer's hopes and desires. A number of factors are important when positioning a product:


Position the product in the best spectrum of the market possible. Donât pitch the product too high or too low in terms of affordability and luxury.
Position the facts about the product according to the person you're selling it to. You may have a handful of different facts, but it's up to your skill to know which of those facts best serve each individual sale.
Don't fudge facts or lie outright. Product positioning is about perception, not deception.
Position the facts so that they transcend the product itself. This means that the desirable, positive values associated with the product are what sell it. Companies that excel at this include Coca-Cola, Apple, and many designer goods or labels. Think about how your product will connect with a customerâs lifestyle or values, and not simply serve a function.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a relatively high-end minivan to a wealthy older person, you might mention its luxurious features. Do this by saying things like: âTake a look at that wood trimâitâs just beautiful. And those soft leather seatsâtheyâre so comfortable. Theyâre perfect for taking a nice sunset drive.â
If you were trying to sell the same minivan to a family with three children, however, you would emphasize its more utilitarian features. For example, you could say things like: âThe third seat adds lots of room for carting friends around. It also folds down when you need room for hauling groceries, sporting gear, and things like that. And did I mention that side air bags and anti-lock brakes come standard?â

, Long-term lovers of your product will only come about if you've been honest with them. This means being transparent in your delivery of product information and also admitting your own lack of knowledge or mistakes you've made. Don't be afraid of honesty; it builds trust.


If you ever are not able to answer customersâ questions or supply them with what they need, offer to follow up with them later, as soon as you are able to.
Make sure customers know they can come back to you later if they have questions or concerns.
If it ever turns out that a product isnât right for a customer, be honest about it and help the customer find what he or she really needs.Even if you donât make the sale today, your honesty and generosity will be remembered, and can translate into future sales.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a sports car to customer who eventually tells you that he has five young children who he drives to school everyday, you could say something like: âWell maybe youâd be better off with a good minivan or SUV. But if youâre ever in the market for a second vehicle, come back and talk to me and Iâll help you get a good deal.â

, There are many styles and methods of closing a sale, but one of the most effective has the mnemonic, ABC: ""Always Be Closing.""As you confirm your prospective buyer's interest in the product, put forward trial closes like, ""Does this sound like the product you want?"" or âSo what do you think? Will this meet your needs?â

, Appearing overly pushy is a turn-off for many buyers.They may want to go home and do a quick online search for more information. Let them do so with your enthusiastic and supportive pitch in mind. If you've been truthful, helpful, considerate, and enthusiastic, and the information you've given them matches with what they read online, they are likely to come back to your product.


Sometimes, it pays to let your customers take the lead. Give them time to consider, and keep quiet while they do. Only offer more information when they request it.Donât let customers get away without knowing how to contact you. If you are working in a store or on site, make sure customers will know how to find you again (especially if you will be moving around). Make sure to tell customers something like ""I'll be right here at the counter if you need me,"" or ""Just ask any sales associate to page me if you have any questions.""
You can also give customers your contact information so they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want more information. Slip the customer your business card or other contact information and say something: ""Call me anytime if you have questions, and you can also find me right here in the store on weekdays.""
Use your instincts. If you think a customer is close to buying, stay nearby without being intrusive. Youâll want the customer to be able to find you quickly. The last thing you want is for a potential buyer to decide to purchase and then be unable to find you.

Familiarize yourself with all aspects that feed into the end sale of a product.,
Market your product.,
Review your sales performance.You should analyze your sales at regular intervals.,
Troubleshoot sales, if necessary.",How to Sell a Product3," As an owner salesperson, that is, one who owns the business that is selling the product, you have the ability to affect more than just the interaction with buyers. In addition to the strategies mentioned in the rest of this article, you can also use other functions to improve your sales. Advertising, merchandising, and marketing are support functions for sales.Selling is the goal of these support functions and a good owner salesperson needs to have a decent understanding of each of these.



Read basic texts on marketing. These will inform you about many of the tactics and techniques underlying advertising, merchandising, and marketing.

, It is important to make your product information available through as many channels as possible. Today, the range of potential placements has increased a great deal thanks to the advances in communications. Give your potential buyers many possible places to find out more about your product in numerous ways, such as:


Word-of-mouth
Advertising (radio, TV, print, email, social media, online ads, etc.)
Sales representatives
Trade shows
Conferences
Cold call sales
Product placement in movies, sports, etc.
Local community events (for instance, donating a product to a local benefit auction will draw attention to your product and serve a good cause), Is the product selling well? Is stock low or high? Are you profiting? How are your competitors performing? Being able to answer these questions will help you maximize your sales, and keep growth steady.

, If you are not selling well, you will need to enter problem-solving mode. Improving your sales will involve reassessing your product, customer base, and marketing.Change your tactics periodically. If customers hear the same sales routine over and over again, or see the same display month in and month out, your product might start to seem irrelevant.
Consider deleting a product from your line if it is not selling well. Stock can be sold at discounted prices to liquidate it.
Review your target market and sharpen your sales focus. Your buyers might be changing, and you will want to keep up with them, or else find a new market.
Re-evaluate the product design, distribution, packaging, etc. Tweaking the product with your target market and sales strategy in mind can improve your sales.
Change the price of your product. By studying your sales data and competitorsâ performance, you may be able to tell if you are charging too much or too little for your product.
Make the product exclusive, or available for a limited time only. Sometimes, controlling supply in this way will increase demand and sales. Make sure that this tactic works with your overall sales strategy, however. If you are marketing a product as perfect for everyday use, it may not work to also market it as exclusive.

Provide your contact details.",How to Do a Handover in an Office," You should start by having a detailed discussion with your manager to determine exactly how they want you to handle the handover. Depending on your job and how your manager likes to work, you may be asked to contribute extensively to the handover. This could include the new person shadowing you for a few days or longer.In most instances you will have to at least prepare a formal handover document.
Discuss this with your manager and find out how much you are expected to contribute, and what the focus of your handover should be.;
, Once you have a clear idea of your managerâs expectations, you can start by drawing up a draft handover document. This will help you to organise yourself, and catalogue all the various tasks and pieces of information that you will need to pass on during the handover period. This document should include:


Detailed information on your day-to-day activities, tasks and priorities.
An outline of the key points of the role.
An clear outline of what is expected of your successor.
A list of any essential files that will be handed over. This might include a particular contract, or work programme., If you know you will be leaving your post soon, it can be helpful to put in a little extra work to make sure that you tie up any loose ends. You will get a sense of satisfaction at achieving this, and you will also be helping your successor start off with a clean slate. Doing this will also help ensure that you leave on excellent terms and with a good reputation.This wonât always be possible, but if you have something that is nearly over the line, put in a little extra work to get it done.
A new person coming into a deal right when it is near the line may struggle to get it closed, because they are unfamiliar with all its intricacies.

, Before your successor is due to start, try to make some time to talk to your colleagues about the handover and ask if there is anything your colleagues think you should highlight. If there is a developing issue that you are unaware of, this is a good opportunity to touch base and find out.


Developing issues are not likely to affect your final days, but if you are aware of them then you can flag them up to your successor.
This is also a chance to make sure everyone knows youâre leaving and when. Let your colleagues know about the handover period, so that they can take it into consideration.
Your productivity is likely to slow during the handover, so its good practice to give your colleagues some advance warning.

, The final step of your handover preparation is to complete a formal handover document. You can build on the draft document, but try to elaborate and include all the important information. You will need to run through the document with your manager and any other key staff it will affect. Try to have this completed and sent to your successor at least a few days before they are set to start. The content will vary from job to job, but it may include some of the following:A list and timetable of actions.
A briefing of ongoing issues.
A calendar of forthcoming events and deadlines.
Passwords and login information.
A list of useful contacts.A guide to navigating files and folders on the computer system.

, When your successor begins in the office, you may still be around and be asked to do a more complete handover. The length of this will vary, but in some instances you will be given a few days or longer to help the new person get to grips with the job. Generally the more time you have available for a full handover, the more information you will be able to pass on.


There are bound to be things that you forgot about, and having someone shadow you is a good way to expose them to the variety of day-to-day activity.

, During the handover, it is good practice to ensure that all the key pieces of data and documentation and handed over personally. This will help you to make sure that the most important things are dealt with appropriately and priorities are clearly set out. Handing over documents face-to-face means that complex information can be discussed fully before you leave.

This will also give you an opportunity to provide nuance and context in a discussion that might have been overlooked otherwise., If you are in the office with your successor, you should always be attentive and proactive. Make the effort to identify and help resolve any occurring issues. Your successor may be a little shy or intimidated in their first few days, and may not want to hassle you with questions.


Make sure you make it clear that you are there to help, and you welcome queries.
By doing this, you will be helping to foster a situation in which the responsibility for the handover is shared between you and your successor., The last thing to do before you leave and complete the handover, is to do full handover meeting with your successor. Ask your successor to bring along any outstanding questions they have, and the notes they have made. This meeting is a great opportunity for the new person to ensure that they understand their role and responsibilities.


Any uncertainties can be cleared up in the meeting.
Depending on where you work, it might be prudent to invite your manager or supervisor to attend the meeting.
You should certainly inform your manager of when and where it is taking place, and ask them if there is anything they would like to add., Try to think of the handover as an opportunity for you to really contribute to giving someone the best possible chance to succeed. You are not just trying to hand off tasks and jobs, but are trying to help your successorâs professional development and your former employerâs long term-health.Do this by pointing out any relevant training opportunities that you know of.
Perhaps when you started the job, you received a suite of training to help you adapt and develop.
Be sure you mention this to your successor, and encourage them to explore the possibilities.

, If you are spending time with the person who will be filling your position, itâs important not to focus solely on technical aspects of the job. Each place has a unique working environment and culture that can be intimidating or confusing for a newcomer. Be sure to set some time aside to give the new person the lowdown on how the office functions.


Make the effort to take them around the office and introduce them to everyone.
Be sure you clearly define the role of the new employee as well as existing employees.
If the job description of the new arrival is slightly different to yours, or their responsibilities and priorities are focussed elsewhere, make sure existing staff recognise this., If you really want to go the extra mile, you could provide the new employee with your contact details. You might say that they can contact you if there is a major issue or they need a little guidance. Not everyone will be happy to do this, and it is likely to depend on your relationship with your former employer.


Often a problem can be resolved with a simple email.
Offering to help out after you leave will make a good impression and help boost your reputation."

Do what you love most.",How to Be a Designer," Try to notice what you like or donât like about a design, and begin thinking about what makes some designs better or more suitable than others.


Nearly everything in the man-made environment has some sort of design behind it, whether itâs a graphic, a website, or a fashion accessory.
Notice how well the design functions for its intended purpose, as well as how it looks.
Practice being specific about aspects of particular designs, and how these aspects work together as a whole.
For example, if you are looking at a graphic design, notice how the colors, lines, proportions, text, and shapes make the design more or less pleasing, and how clearly it conveys its message.;
, While it strives to make things look good, design differs from other types of art in that it has a practical application.


A logo, for instance, is a type of graphic design that helps make a brand or company quickly recognizable.
An article of clothing serves the purpose of covering the body, in addition to making the wearer look more attractive.
A carâs dashboard is designed to make it easy to read the various gauges, as well as enhance the look of the carâs interior.

, Designers need to be able to make drawings or other representations of their designs in order to refine them and explain them to other people, such as design colleagues and manufacturers.


By learning how to visually convey what you imagine, you can improve on it and work out the details. There is only so much you can picture in your head or describe with words.
Drawing is a powerful tool for designers, but donât worry if you canât draw photo realistically. Designersâ drawings donât have to be masterpieces, just a way to quickly capture ideas that will lead to the finished product. Tracing is also totally acceptable.
In addition to drawings, designers also use things like mock ups, prototypes, and computer imaging to visualize their designs.

, When you work as a designer, you not only have to consider what is pleasing to the eye, you always have to consider how your design will be implemented.


Shoe designers have to decide on technical aspects of creating a shoe, such as where the leather will be sewn together and what type of sole will be used.
For an object like a cellphone case, industrial designers need to think about what kind of plastic and molding processes will be used, and how each part will be attached together.

, In addition to design magazines, look for books about the process, principles, and methods of design.


Try looking at textbooks and technical videos for things apparel construction, manufacturing methods, and various craft techniques.
Even if you donât understand everything, try to get a feel for what kinds of technical processes you might be interested in working with.
Learning about design goes deeper than reading fashion and decorating magazines, although these are a good resource for current trends.

, Finding out about their personal philosophies of design, educational background, and working habits can give you insight into your own interests and ambitions.


Do internet research, read biographies, and watch documentaries about famous designers, and pay attention to how their careers were shaped.
Remember that you can be a successful designer, even if youâre not from Paris or New York. Think about how your own background and imagination can make your designs unique.
Try looking at designers you donât like as well. Find out how they contrast from the people you admire--or perhaps gain a new-found appreciation for their work.

, Design schools are a great way to gain information about design, learn good work habits and techniques, and network with other designers.


A 4-year design program at a specialized design school is an excellent start, but itâs not the only option.
Many universities and colleges also have design programs.
Consider taking a workshop or short diploma course at a design school. There are many excellent intensive programs that take as little as 3 weeks to two years.

, Donât worry, also, if an interest in design is not something you anticipated earlier in your career path.


Many designers started out in other fields, such as fine art, architecture, or marketing, and others never studied formally.
It often takes some time to discover what aspects of design youâre good at, and sometimes you canât anticipate the reception your designs will get.
The only way to figure out where your design career will lead you is to keep designing and showing your work!

, Study and practice is good, but the thing that will really take your design to the next level is real world experience.


When people have to pay for your work, it will become a lot clearer what is really expected of you as a designer.
This can actually cut through a lot of indecision, on your part. You will find out what itâs really essential to complete in a project. Sometimes as students we tend to be too finicky.
Consider getting an apprenticeship or working as an intern at a design firm. This will give you a good feel for working in a professional environment.
You can also take freelance projects. Tap your personal contacts and look online for freelancing opportunities, and gradually build up clients.

, As a professional designer, you will often work with other people on a team, and will have to know how to share and delegate work.


Itâs important to maintain a cooperative, rather than competitive attitude towards other designers. This will lead to being able to do more work, faster, and getting better projects.
Donât underestimate how much you can learn from your peers. While one person can have a lot of good ideas, more heads are always better than one.
Collaboration can also make decisions more efficient. Often, you can really benefit from another perspective.
Donât insist on doing everything yourself. Often itâs more important that the work gets done- even if itâs not exactly the way you imagine. Learn to compromise.

, Itâs important to nurture your own style, but at the same time, itâs important not to panic if you canât decide what that is at first.


Sometimes it takes a while to figure out what sort of work is really unique to you, and usually this just happens by accident.
Donât be afraid to take inspiration by what others have done, and incorporate it into your work from time to time. Itâs important to try a lot of different things.
Of course, you donât want to copy a design outright, but designers are often influenced by each other. Avoid falling into an âidentity crisisâ while worrying about not being unique enough.
Remember that a style evolves over time. The signature styles of great designers often become more apparent a bit later in their careers.

, Donât focus too long on any one project, especially if youâre just starting. As a beginning designer, you will make lots of mistakes, and the faster you can get through them, the better.


Instead of making one design at a time, consider working on a series. This will give you room to test a lot of ideas, rather than worrying so much about making the wrong choices for one piece.
Also consider doing preparatory work for important designs. Make a lot of sketches and prototypes quickly, first, in order to economize on materials and avoid costly and time consuming mistakes.
Look for quicker ways to make things. For prototypes, make things out of cheap materials that are easy to work with. You donât have to hand carve everything from mahogany.

, Have a camera and sketchbook handy, and collect designs that you find particularly interesting.


Look for inspiration everywhere. Inspiration doesnât have to come from other designs or design trends--often it can come from nature or things that happen by accident.
Have a good filing system and go through your collection of ideas regularly.

, Itâs not normal to feel like designing 24/7, so donât get discouraged if your enthusiasm wanes sometimes.


Actively look for inspiration. If you feel stuck, go to a museum or look at interesting designs.
Have regular hours when you work on your designs. Often inspiration wonât hit until you actually sit down to work.

, Understand that from time to time you will have doubts about your talent, or get negative feedback, but this is all part of the learning process.


Donât worry if your work really is terrible sometimes. Mistakes are often better teachers than successes.
Donât take criticism personally. Just because someone doesnât agree with your approach doesnât mean youâre a bad designer or person.
If you get a negative reaction, consider how you could have done better. Be open to valid suggestions for improvement.
If you violently disagree, get more opinions. Not everyone has to like your designs, and perhaps you need a different audience.

, Sometimes you have to let your unconscious mind work on a problem, so you can go back to your work with a fresh perspective.


When you work for too long without stopping, sometimes you can get stuck in a rut, start to panic, or make mistakes. Learn to notice when you are losing focus.
Try to determine your optimal schedule for working and taking breaks. Everyone has times in the day when they are more productive. Try to notice when yours are.
Planning to have some downtime is essential. Working too hard can burn you out, and make you less productive in the long run.

, A portfolio is a showcase of your design skills, and essential for job interviews, some school applications, and freelance work.


Always show your best work, and present it as professionally as you can. Avoid having to explain your work, or showing unfinished work.
Consider an online portfolio as well, so that your potential clients and employers can view your work more conveniently.
Research how to make a properly formatted, professional looking portfolio. For some tips, check out this guide.

, Professionalism and a little bit of business savvy are absolutely necessary for a successful design career.


Even the most talented designers have to market themselves. Taking the time to strategize from a business perspective doesnât mean youâre âselling out.â
Whatever kind of design you engage in, clients and buyers will only hire you if they think your designs will improve the success of their business.
Understand how your designs can help make profit for others, and this will help you figure out how to sell yourself.

, The more you are able to support yourself through design, the more time you can spend designing. Look for ways to get paid for doing what you love.


Think creatively about ways to market your designs. If there are certain types of designs you like to do, consider what kinds of establishments might be we willing to pay for them.
Find out how much clients are willing to pay designers for certain types of work, and see what you can do to maximize your earnings.
Also, paid work leads to trying new things that can help you progress further as a designer. See making money as a tool for learning about what works and what doesnât.

, There are many different types of design work, and you may not, as a beginning designer, be aware of all your options.


There are many types of design professions, and some of them are not well known outside the design industry.
Keep your options open, and do some research on lesser known design careers. Many people go into design thinking they will be a big name designer, but there are many other exciting jobs available.
Here are a few less well known design careers:

Package designer
Environmental designer
User-Interface designer
Product developer
Fashion public relations specialist
Merchandise manager



, As a designer, looking and acting professional are the medium through which you communicate your ability to accurately gauge the world around you.


People will anticipate better work from you if you are able to show competence, not only through your work, but through the way you present yourself.
Do your designs justice by paying attention to your professional image. Look and act the part of a talented designer at all times, and people will tend to look more favorably on your work.

, Wanting a glamorous or prestigious design career can drive you to work harder, but always look for motivation from the work itself.


Ambition by itself will never make your designs any better. Look for problems to solve that fascinate you, and projects that you feel are truly beautiful and helpful.
Furthermore, if you truly love what you are doing, chances are you will find a market for yourself. Whatever happens, donât give up!

Understand the goal.,
Make sure that your heart is in it.,
Figure out who you're trying to satisfy.",How to Do Things Right1," What are the things that you are trying to do right, and why are you doing these things? You might be referring to a specific task or set of tasks â or you might just want to do things ""right,"" in general, over the scope of your life.


If you want to do a specific thing rightâsay, court a girl the right way, or complete a sensitive task at workâthen you need to know what it means to do that thing right. If it's a task at work, then your supervisor or employer has probably given you some guidelines to define what you're supposed to be doing. If you are trying to treat a girl right, you'll need to answer the question: ""right"" in whose eyes?
If you want to learn to do more things ""right,"" then it might help to examine what you mean. Do you want to be more precise, more structured, and more mindful? Do you want to bring your deeds in line with a certain moral code or value system? Do you want to impress or appease someone?;
, Check in with yourself: are you doing these things to satisfy your own sense of purpose, or only to please someone else? If you're acting to please someone else, think about why you want to please this person. Ensure that they aren't taking advantage of you and your time. Trust yourself, and remember that you always have a say in the matter., Correctness can be deeply subjective, depending on the goals, people, and tasks in question. Thus, in order to do things right, you'll need to answer the question: right in whose eyes? Decide whether you are going by your own concept of ""right,"" or trying to do something right for someone else, or sticking to a broader value system that determines right and wrong.


If you are trying to do something right according to your own standards, then ask yourself what is important to you. Is it more ""right"" to be precise, or to be thoughtful, or to be truthful?
If you are trying to do something for someone else, then you'll need to ask them to be clear about what they want. You're going by their concept of correctness, so it is their responsibility to clearly communicate their vision.
If you are trying to stick to a standard or a value system, try to learn the system as well as you can. Immerse yourself in this set of rules or way of thinking. Try to internalize it â but not without a grain of salt!"
"
Read the instructions.,
Ask someone.,
Research on your own time.",How to Do Things Right2," If you are trying to do a specific thing right, be sure to absorb any directions or advice to which you have access. The path laid out in the instruction manual is probably not the only way to do things â but it is certainly a way to get your bearings. Trust your own internal compass, but don't be too proud to have a look at the guidelines.

, If you aren't sure how to do things right, the best way to learn is to ask for help from someone who does know how to do these things right. If you are at work, for instance, and you are doing things for your supervisor: the best way to get on track is to ask your supervisor for advice and support. Ask questions about specific examples, and try to get the clearest possible picture of your ""ideal performance.""

, If you want to learn more about a process or a discipline, you'll need to put in some dedicated work to wrap your head around it more completely. Use your passion, your drive, and your curiosity as motivation.


Take classes. If you want to know more, then you might consider finding a more structured way to study what interests you. Take free classes online, or find a private tutor, or enroll in a course at a local learning center.
Peruse the Internet. There is a wealth of information out there for your learning convenience. Start with a simple web search, and follow interesting links until you are engaged in your research.
Read books! Buy or borrow a book on a subject that relates to the things you want to do right.

"
"
Get started.,
Practice.,
Keep perspective.",How to Do Things Right3," Do not let the desire to do something perfectly stop you from doing the thing! Precision can be very important, but only up to a point. Make a plan, and think about the contingencies, and think about what it will mean to do this thing right â but then do it! Don't wait, and don't procrastinate. You may find that once you get started, everything becomes much more clear.


Self-doubt can be crippling. Remember that you can only give what you have. Instead of focusing on some rigid ideal of ""rightness,"" think about how you can put your own uniquely ""right"" spin on the situation.

, Exercise discipline and stay accountable to yourself. Learn how to do what you need to do, and do it more often as you improve. Make a commitment to becoming more effective. The more practiced and confident you are, the easier it will be to do things right.

, It is a wonderful sentiment to want to do things right. However: correctness can be narrow and subjective, and it is important to remember that there are often many ways to do a thing. Don't be too hard on yourself! Try to do things right, but also try to do them thoughtfully. Make sure that your heart's in it.Do not lose sight of why you're trying to do things right. Do not let your obligations and responsibilities cloud your purpose.
Don't be afraid to challenge and change the way that things are laid out. You are the one doing these things! You have the power and prerogative to take ownership of your actions and set your own course.

Place the documents in a large trashcan.,
Pour in Â½ Gallon (2L) of bleach.,
Add 5 Gallons (19L) of water.,
Push the documents down into the bleach water.,
Let the documents sit for 24 hours.,
Blend the documents with a paint turbine mixer.,
Lay out in sunlight to dry.,
Dispose of the pulp.",How to Destroy Sensitive Documents1," You will want a container tall and wide enough to easily contain all of the documents and liquids you are pulping. Similarly, the material needs to be strong enough so that it wonât deteriorate or lose its form when in contact with bleach and water. Since you will be using roughly 22L of liquid to dissolve the documents, choose a trashcan that is greater than or equal to 30L. This will give you enough room to properly churn the documents. Plastic trashcans work well and can withstand the effects of diluted bleach.Large plastic trashcans are available at home improvement and construction stores, as well as general commodity stores like Kmart, Target, and Walmart. They are also available online.
Remove the documents from any envelopes or packages.;
, Many stores sell brand name and generic bleach with a 8.25% concentration; this is perfect for your purpose.Bleach is going to help break down the paper. Commonly used in the recycling of used paper, it will also destroy the colorants of ink.This will guarantee a more complete destruction of any secure information in your documents.


Bleach is a hazardous chemical and can cause serious illness if not safely used. Avoid contact with your skin and eyes; do not ingest bleach. Only mix bleach with water. Combining with other chemicals â such as ammonia or toilet bowl cleaners â can produce toxic, potentially deadly fumes.It is advised to wear long sleeve clothing, pants, close toed shoes and an eye cover when working with bleach.In the case you accidentally swallow any of the solution, immediately drink a small glass of water or milk. Call poison control at 1-800-222-1222., Although bleach is the more chemically harmful (and stronger) part of this mixture, simple water is doing a lot of the work. Once the paper is completely saturated, youâll be able to reduce it to an unrecognizable pulp.

, All the documents need to be submerged so they are completely saturated and can be broken down. If you have more documents that liquids, then you can do one of two things: work in smaller batches, or work with a larger container. If you choose the latter, make sure you increase your proportions of water and bleach to match.


Do not use your bare hands to push the documents down. This can cause great harm to your skin. Instead use the paint turbine mixer, a broom stick, or else wear long rubber gloves.
For example, assume you have 30L plastic bin with 22L of liquid. If you have too many documents for this and purchase a 90L bin, you should be using 6L of bleach and 57L of water.

, Sitting in the bleach-water solution for 24 hours will effectively break down the sensitive documents and make them easy to pulp. If this is an emergency situation, and/or the documents need to be destroyed more quickly, consider the other methods listed here.

, After waiting 24 hours, the documents should be soft and discolored. Using an electric mixer, blend the paper until it becomes a soft, uniform mash.


If at any point you reach into the pulp to check the contents, always wear rubber or nitrile gloves to prevent skin exposure.Broomsticks, canes, staffs and other long handled tools work as well. Anything that can reach deep into the container to churn and break apart the paper will succeed.
Sift through the pulp looking for any large clumps. If there are pieces where you can still identify the information, break them apart by hand and then continue mixing.

, Putting the pulp directly into bags may lead to leakage and could possibly be rejected by the garbage men. Instead, lay out a large plastic tarp and pour the pulp evenly over the surface. Allow the pulp to dry completely before disposing of it.


Some people decide to use this dried pulp as mulch for their yards. However, if you go this route, itâs advised to not use bleach during the pulping process.

, Place the dried remains in garbage bags and leave them out with the regular trash. Anyone who goes digging through your garbage â such as identity thieves â will be hard pressed to learn anything from your pulped documents.

Set up an outdoor fire pit.,
Start a fire.,
Place the sensitive documents in the fire.,
Check the ashes.,
Burn any remaining pieces.,
Scatter the ashes.",How to Destroy Sensitive Documents2," Standard fire pits are ideal for burning documents because they stand off the ground and have top covers. This allows for better airflow, which leads to a more complete burn of your documents. Also, it somewhat prevents the escape of document fragments from the fire.


Be advised that in most cases it is illegal to openly burn trash in residential areas and cities. In some cases you will need a permit. Check your city specific regulations by searching your stateâs name and âopen burn regulationsâ.
Another excellent option is professional burn cages. These are metal cages that function as outdoor incinerators.
Burn barrels are another option. Steel drum barrels of 55 gallons are the most common, and will do a better job of keeping document fragments within. However, it is not recommended to use as they produce harmful toxins, and their use is illegal in some states, such as Illinois.It may also be safer to burn the individual piece inside of a cast-iron bathtub. Make sure that there is nothing in the bottom, such as plastic foot grips. This way, if it does somehow manage to get out of control, you have the tub with a ready supply of water.

, It is generally easier to start a fire if you begin with kindling (smaller pieces of wood that are easier to burn), and paper. You can even use the sensitive documents as fire starter. Once the kindling is lit, add progressively larger pieces of wood until you have a stable burn.


For your safety, there should be no flammable shrubbery, paper, or material of any kind around the fireâs perimeter. To guarantee fires accidentally start and spread beyond the fire pit, pour sand around the perimeter. It is also advisable to place stones around the firepit.
If you are having trouble getting the fire very strong, use lighter fluid. Be careful not to drop the bottle in the fire or spray too much at once. It is possible to create large explosions and bursts of flame that could injure you. Stand further away from the flame while spraying the lighter fluid to avoid singing your face, chest, and arms.

, Donât dump them all at once; this could cause small pieces of information to fall by the side. Burn individual pieces, holding them with metal tongs, to ensure they are completely burned. Once the fire has been burning for a while it may have a stable heart (center of hot embers). With a stable heart, you can place more of the documents in at once and allow them to burn, protected by the wood.


When burning, proper ventilation is important, not only to avoid smoke inhalation but also to ensure a full and proper burn. The open grate of a fire pit allows for this ventilation; so does limiting the amount of paper you insert at once.
Watch the make sure no document fragments are blown from the fire. Even small amounts of information could be the exact valuable pieces other people desire.
Burn the sensitive documents along with other pieces of scrap paper. If by accident a part is not burnt, the remains of the scrap paper mixed in will help confuse anyone who tries to read your information.

, Once you think everything is burned and the fire is out, shift through the ashes and look for any unburned paper. The easiest to spot will be paper that somehow still has a white sheen. However, also be on the lookout for pieces that have turned grey, but still have legible text. Even these must be burnt more completely.

, Gather all the sensitive debris and store it in a safe, closed compartment until you have the fire burning again. Using protective fire gloves, or long metal tongs, securely place the document fragments in the fireâs center.

, Wait for the fire to go out, and for the ashes to cool to a safe temperature. Using a shovel, gather them in a bag that will not rip. If you have a yard, scatter the ashes evenly throughout your yard.


It is also possible to use a small amount of ash in composting units (so long as you did not use lighter fluid to make the fire).Ashes spread around garden plants discourages slugs and snails.
It is also beneficial to pour ash around the base of hardwood trees."

Gain access to a crosscut shredder.,
Shred the documents.,
Separate the pieces into separate bags.,
Dispose of them on the scheduled day.",How to Destroy Sensitive Documents3," When shredding sensitive documents it is important to use a crosscut shredder (as opposed to a more basic strip-cut shredder), because it produces thinner strips of paper. This protects you from would-be thieves of this information from reconstructing the complete pages from the strips. Chose a machine that creates strips less than or equal to 1/32nd of an inch with a Â½ inch crosscut.


Paper shredders can be purchased at office supply stores and are classified into six security levels based on the thinness of cut. One is the widest cut; six is the thinnest and approved for Top Secret government documents. Anything less than a 4 (1/16 * 5/8â) is not recommended for sensitive documents.Most offices have paper shredders or record destruction services. Check with your office manager and see if you can bring in your own documents for destruction.

, Once you have a satisfactory shredder, begin sending all of your documents through the deviceâs mouth. Continue until all of your documents are done. If you have more documents than the machine can hold at one time, be sure to take the ribbons of paper out before continuing.


Do not put your hand or fingers in direct contact with the shredderâs mouth. Hold the documents by the end so that there is distance between you and the mouth. Once the shredder has the paper within its grip, release the documents. Above all, protect the safety of your hands.
Traditional shredders (that cut paper into strips) won't keep someone from putting it back together. Hand ripping isn't a good idea either, especially on small documents (it takes 2 centimeters to find out a person's Social Security Number).

, Beyond reducing them to unrecognizable small pieces, this is one further security measure. Take a portion of each document and place them in separate bags. This way, any would be thieves cannot find matches within the same bag; they will have to sort through everything.

, If garbage is picked up from your house/business on a Tuesday, donât put this out on a Wednesday. You want to leave as little time as possible between when the garbage goes out and when it is collected. Ideally you will keep it inside until the day of collection, and bring it down just before the city employees arrive.

Delete the documents.,
Overwrite the hard drive.,
Degauss the hard drive.,
Physically destroy the hard drive.,
Permanently delete incriminating emails.,
Clear your browser history.",How to Destroy Sensitive Documents4," Locate all the files on your hard drive containing sensitive data. Right click and send them to the trash. Empty your trash. If there is no risk that someone will use more advanced techniques to retrieve your data, this is an acceptable and simple method. However, it is fairly easy to recover âdeletedâ files, as there are a number of file recovery programs on the market.Do not use this method if there is a risk others will make an effort to recover the sensitive information.
Do not use this method if the sensitive information could be used to cause you harm or distress.

, All the information on your hard drive is represented in binary numbers: 1âs and 0âs. This is the computerâs language. Overwriting programs â available online â go through and replace all the information on your hard drive with random strings of 1âs and 0âs. If you decide to choose this method, be advised it is semi-permanent and it may be impossible to recover the data in question.


Most overwriting programs do multiple âpassesâ of your data. Three passes are considered standard by U.S. government.Back up any information you wish to preserve on an external hard drive.
There are also programs like Eraser that allow you to manually overwrite specific files.

, Degaussing refers to exposing magnet-based technology (e.g. hard drives) to a powerful magnetic field that destroys the data. Ideally it will entirely get rid of the deviceâs magnetic charge and make it impossible to use. Purchasing your own degausser can cost up to $4000.However it is possible to rent one or pay for the professional services of IT companies like Securis.


Although overwriting can potentially be reversed, the degaussing process causes permanent damage, and none of the data can be recovered. Be sure to back up anything you want to preserve onto an external hard drive or cloud storage.
Do not operate a degausser if you have a pace maker, as it can cause damage to this important medical equipment., The most complete method available is physical destruction. Hammering, high heat, and drilling are all acceptable methods. Whatever method you choose, first remove the hard drive from any outer framework. If hammering, apply extreme force directly on top of the hard drive. If drilling, ensure that you punch several holes directly through the drive. If using heat (e.g. blow torch), completely melt through the hard drive.


When using a blowtorch, wear heat resistant gloves, as well as a protective face shield. It is safest to work over dirt or sand to prevent fires or explosions.
While working with a hammer or drill, wear protective gloves and a face shield to protect yourself from flying debris.
It is also possible to shoot holes through the hard drive with a gun. Do not operate a firearm unless you are licensed to do so.

, Select all the emails containing sensitive information and then select âdeleteâ or âtrashâ depending on the program. Many online mail services â such as Gmail â will hold onto âdeletedâ files for 30 days before rendering them unrecoverable to users.Once youâve deleted the emails, go directly to the âDeleted Messagesâ and âTrashâ sections to see if there are any recoverable versions of your email. If so, delete these too.

, Itâs possible you want to prevent others from knowing what websites youâve been visiting. Many browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer have this option. Go through the âmenuâ option to locate your history and delete any incriminating history.

Schedule a time to talk to your boss.,
Make a list of times when micromanagement limited productivity.,
Ask your boss how you can improve.,
Tell your boss youâll give updates in return for independence.,
Schedule one-one-one meetings to check in with one another.,
Create a trial period for your boss to adjust their management style.,
Look for other job opportunities if no changes occur.",How to Deal With a Micromanager1," Itâs important to have a one-on-one, in-person conversation with your boss about this issue. Donât just start chatting about the micromanagement in the break room. Make sure you bring it up during time thatâs dedicated just to this.Be open and honest, but also polite during your meeting. This will encourage your boss to listen to what you have to say without getting angry or defensive.
Open the meeting by saying something like: âIâve noticed that you use hands-on, involved management with my work. Iâd like to make sure that Iâm doing everything I can to provide you with the best work possible, and that Iâm not taking up too much of your time by requiring you to give me this much oversight.â;
, More than anything else, your boss wants good work to get done quickly. Itâs likely that your bossâ micromanagement has actually slowed down your process. Be prepared to give specific examples of each time your bossâ management style led to inefficiency (and lost money for the company).Donât make this list sound like a series of accusations. Instead, use it to demonstrate that you can handle your assignments.
You could say something like: âI know that for our most recent project, you logged about 3 hours double-checking my work. Were there consistent problems you found during this check?â

, If you ask your boss for suggestions, this will feel more like a back-and-forth conversation. This should add a friendly tone to the room. Your boss may also feel more comfortable backing off once theyâve provided you with really specific details about how they like things done.Try: âI really admire how youâve advanced in this company over the past several years. I hope to follow a similar path. Based on my work so far, could you give me some advice on how I might be able to do that?â

, Your bossâ micromanagement may come from their fear that your screw-up could become something they have to deal with. Help them overcome this worry by agreeing to provide weekly updates on ongoing projects. Youâll be trading constant micromanagement for something limited that you can control.These could be emailed updates, conference calls, or even in-person meetings.

, In addition to more frequent updates on projects, see if your boss would also be willing to do monthly or bi-monthly check-ins. These could be broader meeting where they have the opportunity to comment on your work.Try not to get frustrated by having to agree to check-in meetings. Look at them as opportunities to learn from someone in a higher position than you (even if you donât like their management style). And remember, limiting micromanagement is better than dealing with it all the time.

, If your boss is surprised or even resistant during your conversation, ask if theyâre willing to change things up for a month or two. Suggest providing updates and having meetings while you take the wheel on projects.Maybe no other downtrodden employee has ever been brave enough to bring up this problem. You could be the first! In that case, your manager might simply need a little time to adjust.
The trial period is a great way to show your boss how wonderful a micromanagement-free workplace can be. Be sure to be on your game during the trial.
Bring up the trial period by saying: âIâd really like to test out a new approach for a few months, if youâre on board. I believe it could speed up our process, and Iâll ensure that the quality of our work remains high.â

, Your boss may be unwilling to budge. If this is the case, the workplace could become damaging to your self-esteem and mental health. Start searching online job boards and websites like LinkedIn to find new career possibilities.Try to give any new job at least a year before moving on. This will look better on your resume, and your boss will be more likely to give you a good reference.

Leave work at work to give yourself a break.,
Set rules for yourself to keep your schedule balanced.,
Remind yourself of reasons you enjoy your work.,
Try to understand your bossâ reasons for micromanagement.,
Hang out with your co-workers outside the office.,
Do yoga or other exercise routines to relax.",How to Deal With a Micromanager2," Donât spend all your time obsessing about problems youâre having at work. This could lead to lots of anxiety, lost sleep or appetite, and feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Take your time at home to unwind and be with your family and friends., Itâs important that you donât work yourself to death to try to satisfy your micromanager. Stick to your scheduled hours, and make sure youâre not skipping breaks or lunches.If you donât have regularly scheduled breaks, add a strategic one to your daily schedule. Take 10 minutes in the afternoon when your energy is really down. Go up and and down the hallway a few times, breathing deeply as you walk.

, As frustrated as you are, thereâs a reason you applied for and got this job. Make a list of the reasons why you like the job, putting stars next to things that you find especially rewarding. Keep this list on your desk and glance at it when youâre feeling upset.

, Itâs important to empathize with your boss. They may be micromanaging you or everyone in the office because theyâre running up against a tough deadline or are feeling pressured by their own boss. Put yourself in their shoes and remember that youâre all on the same team., Getting to know your officemates may really help you feel better at work. While you shouldnât gossip about other people at work, take some time to share your mutual frustrations and challenges. You all may be struggling with the same things.Be sure to keep these conversations out of the office.
Talking to each other in this way may help you all think about strategies for creating a better workplace environment, such as having group meetings to talk about team success.

, Being stressed at work creates a lot of tension and unspent energy in your body. Be sure to release this by doing yoga, going for a 20-minute walk or jog, or taking an exercise class at least a few times per week."
"
See if anyone else is being micromanaged.,
Ask yourself if youâve made mistakes recently.,
Ensure that youâre giving your job your full attention.,
Check if you and your manager have different work styles.,
Ask for a performance review to pinpoint the problem.,
Wait a few months if youâre new.",How to Deal With a Micromanager3," Itâs important for you to figure out whether this is general problem, or one that only youâre having with your boss. If itâs happening to everyone, itâs likely your bossâ management style. If itâs just you, your bossâ micromanagement might be happening because they have a problem with your work., If youâve recently screwed up (even if it was a mistake that seemed small to you), your boss could simply be watching to make sure it doesnât happen again. Small and big errors can sometimes cause huge problems for companies. Be patient while you wait to regain your bossâ trust with high-quality work., Even if youâre getting your work done on time, maybe youâre not getting to the office right when it opens. If so, your boss could feel like youâre distracted or donât care about your job. Refocus your attention on work and see if this shifts your bossâ attitude toward you.If youâre supposed to work a set number of hours and youâre meeting those hours, donât go overboard trying to impress your boss. If they want to pay you overtime, thatâs one thing. If not, itâs time to have that conversation about backing off a bit.

, Observe what you wear to work versus what your boss wears. Check out each of your offices. If one of you is super neat and the other tends to be messy, your boss could be judging your appearance and/or work style. You can either accept this or have a conversation about it.If youâre new to this job, you may want to wait a bit while they get used to you. Once they see how brilliant you are, they might back off naturally.

, Your manager may have specific feedback for you that could explain why theyâve been observing your work so closely. If you donât ask for that feedback, you may not get it.Performance reviews are often automatically scheduled once or twice per year. Instead of waiting for that meeting, ask for one in the next week or so.

, If youâve just started this job, expect a little extra hand-holding. You may feel like you donât need it, and this time could be frustrating for you. Still, itâll take a while for people to know they can trust you. Be patient.Wait at least three months at a new job before you begin investigating alternate sources of the micromanagement.

Work out what kind of papers you are handling.,
Work out what office it is relevant to.,
Work out also how they will be stored.,
Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each.,
After you have worked out exactly the needs of each section, start with selecting your filing method.,
Pick the kind that makes running it and referencing the easiest.,
Be consistent, as that makes the system easier.,
After you have chosen the most practical method for the need,


Purchase all filing goods and equipment such as staplers, hole punches etc, files, archive boxes and storage equipment.,
The maintenance is an ongoing duty.,
For large scale systems, its often recommended as part of the system that staff members notify the archive department by phone or email in advance to collection so your team can have everything organised prior to them coming.,
Congratulate yourself.",How to Create a Document Management System from the Ground Up,"


Are they confidential or legal documents.
Do they require quick referencing or can they sit in archives.
Are they required for market history research.
Do the documents have a time limit, so they are active for 12 months, then are no longer active (such as warranties etc)
Can you run one system, or does it need two (or more).;
, Consult with these people as they might have ideas for a very efficient system, or a wish list of things to avoid.


Stores & Receivables
Human Resources
Maintenance
Finance & Admin
Sales & Service
Registration & license
Legal
Marketing
Medical
Historical or Biographical.
Engineering or R+D.
Etc

, Digital copies can be filed simply, but often the original paper copy needs to be kept.


Upright files on a shelf or cupboard.
Upright Filing/File cabinets (with drawers)
Sliding door or drawer systems for large needs.
Pigeonhole or similar.
Satchel, box or envelope.
Will it need to be a formal system or a flexible system, Larger systems are better formalized anyway.
They can be from one central system or localised filing centres.

,


For example: Upright files have limited storage, but are easier to access like pulling a book from a library shelf. Archive boxes store more, but its easier for papers to become loose and lose their filed order.
Envelopes make good ""stash and forget"" for simplified personal filing, but can be very difficult if the envelopes themselves are not well archived or in order themselves as they quickly become messy.

, You can have the choice of alphabetical, chronological, document type, region or a file per entity.


They may be a mix of both, but take into account the purpose of the management. Is it to keep them in order and stored, or is it active information that needs referencing?

, Consider installing these three things:


Copies of the filing system method on each rack, or the filing cupboard door where people can read them so they can quickly learn where things are.
A reference index which shows where an admin or staff from a different section can locate what they need. This is more useful for large archives.
A history page per file, glued to the envelope or file to show who took the file and when, as well as when it was returned. If required, give room to state what was done to the file contents such as copies made or papers added/removed.

, Aim to install a system that runs itself because there are times you may be on holiday or ill and someone will have to run it.

,
Prepare your site so files can then be stored.
Collect all relative papers and collate them in order they need to be.
Make digital copies if needed and save them to the correct drive and sub files. Protect them and save them as read-only files so no accidents occur.
File the papers away in the correct file, box or satchel and then store them.
Take note of where you filed it for the index if needed.

, Consider various ways to cover the following common problems:


Files are getting too big or damaged - in which case you can get another file or a box.
Data contained is no longer current - for these you can archive them and store them. If they are of no future use and it is authorised to dispose of them, shred and recycle the papers.
For damaged works, copy the original and leave the copy in the file and place the original in a safe place for such needs. In some cases the integrity of the original is essential. Label the copy as a copy and record when this was done (as they may need certifying or witnessing).
Keep the index up to date and keep refining the system should there be a need for it. Ensure people know the changes made.
Ensure that files are returned in the condition they left, it rarely happens, but when it goes back on the shelf it must restored to a good condition.
Do a monthly audit to ensure all files are there, in order and complete. This is also an opportunity to check for the above problems.

,


The benefits are that what is requested gets supplied, they save time and don't have to wait in your section, or involve non archive staff in your section. It also smooths the system so people know they can access papers easier, especially should it be an urgent need.

, Your system should be active, in good order, accessible and can be used by anyone.

Negotiate salary, benefits and a start date.,
Give the applicant you want to hire time to think about your offer.",How to Conduct a Job Interview," As any good surgeon, lawyer, or politician will tell you, it pays to be prepared. Preparing for your interview will ensure that your questions are on-point, your demeanor is professional, and your information is solid. Remember that, in a sense, you're being interviewed as much as you're interviewing the candidate. Keep this in mind.


Review the job description. If you need to revise the duties, skills and responsibilities, do so now. Make sure they're an accurate representation of what the candidate, if accepted, is expected to do.
Gather any reasonable information the candidate might ask for, including, but not limited to, information about the company and company goals, would-be team members, would-be supervisor, pay scale, etc.;
, There are lots of different types of interview methods, many of them quite different from the standard ""Tell us where you see yourself in 5 years"" interviews. Decide which interview method you want to employ based on the job description and the qualifications of the candidates.


Behavioral interview. Instead of asking you how you would behave in a given situation, behavioral interviews ask you how you did behave in the past. Behavioral interviews use â you guessed it â your past behavior as an indication of future success.
Audition interview. An audition interview requires the candidate to show evidence of his or her skills by either solving problems or performing a skill in real time. An audition interview, for example, will look much different for engineers than it will for middle-managers.
Stress interview. Stress interviews are designed to measure the candidates mental fortitude. They typically involve hurling a bit of verbal abuse at the candidate, staring at them silently, and even making them wait long times before being seen.
Tag team interview. Tag team interviews involve several of your colleagues sitting in on and participating in the interview. This gives you more than one perspective off of which to judge the performance of the candidate.

, Before you develop questions you want to ask, take some time to think about who your ideal candidate is. Is she no-nonsense, brutally-efficient, and a results-first person? Or is she a people person who is method-oriented? Is she something in between? Knowing what you're looking for and being clear with everyone involved in the job selection process will make your task much, much easier.

, Your main objective is to ask question that will allow you to see the personality, skill-set, motivation, history, and problem-solving ability of the candidate. The type of interview questions you ask will largely depend on the type of interview you are conduction (see above step).


Ask open-ended questions, leading with ""how,"" ""why,"" ""tell me or what.""
Ask about previous experience. For example, you could ask, ""While working as the comptroller at , what were the steps you took when planning your annual budget?""
Learn about skills. Ask questions or pose statements such as, ""Tell me how you would connect an access database to a tour website.""
Find out more about the person's successes. Ask, ""What achievement are you most proud of?""

, Generally, one hour is plenty of time to complete the interview without feeling rushed. Do your best to stick to the schedule, especially if you have several candidates to interview during the day.

, Do this by:


Reading their CV/resume, cover letter, and any tests or performance evaluations they may have filled out in the initial application process.
Reaching out to any references supplied during the initial application process and asking about past experience, personal demeanor, professional suitability, etc.
Doing a background check (optional but recommended for certain jobs).

, Thank the candidate for coming to talk to you and begin to outline the format of the interview so that they know what to expect. You can keep it vague â ""I'm going to ask you a few questions about your experience and we'll take it from there"" â or you can go more in-depth.


This might also be the time to tell them a little something about yourself and about your role in the company. Make it brief but informative before turning the focus over to the job candidate.

, Include responsibilities and key duties of the position. Make sure you go over any additional requirements, like having the ability to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time, physical strength, dexterity or agility necessary in performing specific tasks. Some medical conditions may prevent the applicant from meeting these requirements.

, Remember the types of questions you can ask in an interview. They include:


General or fact-based questions, e.g. ""What sort of technical experience do you have after 5 years of working in IT?""
Situational or hypothetical questions, e.g. ""How would you confront a situation in which a boss consistently took credit for your innovations?""
Behavioral questions, e.g. ""How did you handle a recent situation in which you were criticized?""

, You won't remember everything you talked about during the interview, and the notes will be helpful later when comparing applicants, especially when interviewing many candidates.

, Some of the interview will hinge on prior screening and careful analysis, but a lot of the interview will hinge on whether you feel like the candidate could perform successfully in the environment for which they are applying. This is mostly about intuition, so don't be afraid to use it in order to evaluate the candidate.

, Throw a lid on the interview once you feel you have developed a good sense of the personality of the candidate, gotten good information, and have adequately discussed the job.


Allow the applicant the opportunity to ask additional questions. While questions are not absolutely essential to leaving a good impression, many hiring managers believe that candidates who ask questions are more educated, eager to learn more, and more motivated about the job.
Let applicants know when you expect to complete the interviewing process and when they can expect to hear from you.

, Interviewing is an art. Asking the right questions in the right way, maintaining the right demeanor, and being able to weed out fact from fiction are all important skills that you need to hone as you continue to interview. Did you have them during the interview? If not, could the candidate benefit from another opportunity to exhibit his or her skills in a different setting?

, This will help you do several things. For one, it will help you differentiate candidates who performed well during the interview from candidates whom you merely likes. Second, it will keep you from hiring someone who is not qualified for the job but who's still the best candidate from a particular round of hiring.The rating system will obviously depend on the job position and whether the previous hiring manager has developed a similar rating system or not. You might take the following as an example of which factors to base the system on:
Proficiency in a certain amount of computer languages
Years managing other people or total number of people managed
Number of marketing campaigns launched



, Why? Certain candidates may be very strong compared to others but still not meet the criteria established by the needs of the job. If you are desperate to hire a good candidate, measuring them against one another is acceptable. If, however, you want to hire the right candidate, it's best to wait until your criteria are met by a candidate.


Upon completion of the interviewing process, two candidates may stand out who meet all the job requirements. You might consider inviting both candidates back for a second interview and tell the applicants you are considering them for the position along with one other applicant. Ask each applicant ""Why should I hire you?""
If you do this, you may decide to offer the job to the applicant who best answers the question, has the best qualifications, and appears to be a good fit with your team.

, You have two goals in negotiating a salary for your would-be hire: you want to get good value out of the new hire (ensuring that your company remains profitable) while also making the new hire feel that s/he is happy and being compensated justly for their time and expertise.

, A week is usually the upper limit, as most hiring managers want a decision within a couple days. If the candidate is especially promising, you might want to offer him or her any perks, bonuses, or options you or your company can reasonably afford during this waiting period.

, One of the most engaging options is to use an audio-visual presentation. This makes the entire session lively and interesting. If you are opting for a PowerPoint presentation, be sure to put together something that's informative but also engaging and appealing.

, Devote your optimum time slots to the most important topics. Provide a brief overview of the future growth plans/ acquisitions and major achievements of the organization. Detailed information about company policies and administration support is always helpful for the new beginners, too.


If you're bringing in outside trainers or managers to conduct any parts of the training sessions, coordinate with them early on to ensure their availability and willing participation.

, Depending on your company, it's probably a good idea to host your induction meetings in a board room or auditorium. Go through any necessary steps to book the space and coordinate with other parties who might be using it. Confirm availability and details as the date approaches. If you are using your own projector or microphone, try to take a practice session before the actual show.

, Depending upon the length of the process, normally snacks and other administrative arrangement s are provided by the company. Make sure to communicate the schedule with the providers also.

, The role of a human resource professional in these sessions is to be a host. Ask your audience individually what they expect from this session and welcome their goals. Try to meet their expectation level and answer their questions.

, Try to conduct the session in a lively environment. Be sure what your message is and accordingly plan the session. Try to focus on opportunities for bonding and embracing the company mission; try to incorporate some role-playing, brain games, and storytelling sessions along with any training you're required to provide.

, If you are planning to cater the employeeâs learning need in this session, coordinate with the trainer and any managers involved. If you're able to conduct the training yourself, go ahead and provide it.

, Try to summarize the complete process at the end and ask each participant what their take-away from the session was. Encourage them to ask questions and express any doubts. Wish them luck for their professional growth with the organization, and give them your contact information if you're available for any future questions and concerns.

Get your group together.,
Hang the work evenly, tack all curling corners down, make sure nothing is in a shadow, or partially hidden.,
Always begin with a positive statement about the work.,
Try to indicate one or two things that jump out that aren't working, could use improvement, refining or changing.,
Become a more savvy and informed viewer of art.,
Refer to the Elements of Design in talking about a piece:


Form/Shape, such as geometric or free form.,
Refer to the Principles of Design and how they are used in the piece:


Alteration, repeating in a definite pattern, like wall paper,
Balance, formal and informal,
Contrast/Conflict, refers to ""the opposite of"" such as light/dark, rough/smooth, soft/hard, etc.,
If you have a question, begin by asking the group to focus on it.,
Be open to the thoughts and ideas generated, but don't let others' opinions deflate your enthusiasm.,
Be silent.,
Get past the fear of hard work, sometimes, especially with watercolor, you will need to do the piece again.,
Pay close attention and you will learn almost as much from what is said about others' work as your own.

",How to Critique Your Peers' Art Work," Getting started is as simple as agreeing to hang work to look at it and comment on it. Â Pass this article around so everyone understands the basic rules. Remind artists that no two people could ever do the same work we are all unique in the way we paint, our marks, like our handwriting is our own. So, there is no fear of somebody copying your style. Reiterate that being competitive is not productive; we are where we are as artists on that day in our journey. Some are bound to be more skilled, but each and every person is an equal.;
, People who have to leave early get to go first. Older work may be hung, but it will get attention only after the new work is critiqued. No finished pieces can be critiqued, because once the artist says, ""Finished"" there is nothing to change.

, Â You will be offering your thoughts and opinions about what you see before you, so always begin with, ""In my opinion,"" or ""To my mind."" Â General statements such as ""I like it"" or ""It's nice,"" are meaningless, so try to isolate what works for you and be specific. Â Be sincere, above all.

, Â Avoid picking the piece to death. Â Use the positive voice and be specific. Â Keep it brief and try not to repeat what others have already said. Â If you have nothing to say, simply pass.

, Ask yourself these questions when faced with giving a critique of an artwork or when viewing a work on display at a gallery, museum, or in a book.


What is the most striking thing about the work, what pulls me in from across the room? Can I sum it up in a sentence?
At what point do I enter the work, how is my eye led around and through it?
Is anything leading acting as a directional sign to lead the viewer's eye out of the piece?
How important is the medium or technique? Would I do it differently?
How is the medium used, could I duplicate it?
How much help is the title? Does it fit the piece?
What, after a time away, floats back to my mind about the piece?

,
Line/Movement, straight or curved.
Space, negative or positive, mass versus emptiness.
Hue/Color, primary, red, yellow and blue, secondary, green orange and violet and tertiary, yellow-green, blue-violet, red-orange. Colors can also be analogous or next to each other on the color wheel, Complementary or opposite each other on the color wheel, or other combinations. Chroma is the intensity or brightness of a color.
Value, the pattern created by lights and darks,
Texture, the surface quality of objects as interpreted by sight or touch, for example, rough, smooth, soft, hard, etc.

,
Dominance, one element having greater importance,
Gradation, closely related qualities organized progressively, in a logical sequence,
Harmony, those elements that are similar,
Variation, a thing made different from the others present,
Repetition, the act or process of repeating again and again,
Unity, the quality of oneness, a complete unit.

, However, keep in mind that sometimes, just hearing ""gut reactions"" Â is best. People will be offering their opinions on the work, but you are in charge of what happens eventually---if anything. It's your work and you are under no obligation to make changes.

, If something cuts too deeply, let it all go for a day or two and you will gain perspective and your confidence will return. Do keep putting up your work. Seeing it along with others' is an education in itself. You'll cross pollinate ideas and get new ideas for directions to explore.

, You are there to listen not argue, defend, or describe. Â People are reacting and commenting on what they see, at that moment, before them, not what you intended to do or how you plan to alter the piece. Do ask for clarification, if you need it. Thank people for their time and interest in your work.

, Put the piece away and after time passes, you will be able to be your own judge.

Be certain about your instructions.,
Use the actions that you have taken in the step above as the grounds for your complaint.,
Request the manager.,
Inform the venue organizers that you will be expecting some renegotiation of the prices.,
Always remain polite as you assert your rights.",How to Complain to a Conference Venue About Its Service Delivery," Before you even arrive at the venue on the day, if possible, you should already have visited it and met with the manager responsible for organizing your event. Personal contact is the number one key to good service. However, for events being organized from a distance, this hands-on approach will not always be possible and you will need to aim for clarity in your correspondence and phone calls. Consider such things as drawing up room layouts and sending or faxing these through, writing letters or emails with precise instructions (bullet points are excellent) and provide precise details of anything that you consider would differ from the venue's normal operational expectations.;
, If you arrive to a poor layout, a missing refreshments table, poor signage, lack of seating etc., immediately seek out the person in charge of the organizing and show them your documentation of how things should be. This means that you must always turn up well in advance of the event to make sure that any changes needed can be accomplished prior to the arrival of attendees.

, If the event organizer is either unhelpful or absent, go straight to the manager of the venue. Often this person is not the actual organizer but will be in charge of overseeing the work and will want their venue to keep a good reputation. Tell this person what has gone wrong, point out that you took many steps to ensure that the venue would be properly prepared for your event and that action must be taken immediately to fulfill their side of the bargain to ensure that the event works smoothly.

, If the event was not organized well, inform them at the wind-up that you will be disputing the invoice and that they will be receiving a detailed letter with reasons. Ask the manager if they are willing to discuss it on the spot but if not, send this letter.

, Be willing to accept comments about the non-clarity or uncertainty of your own communications at any stage but if you have the paperwork, you can talk this through and hopefully demonstrate that you were not clear. At the same time, remain firm where you are in the right; events are not cheap and reputation matters because people will talk about its success or otherwise. It is fine to tell the venue that if they remedy the situation they will continue to be considered, but if not, they will not receive your business again and that you will be letting other businesses know about your experience.

Get a dictionary.,
Ask a neighbor.,
Look on the computer.,
Guess.,
Find a new word.,
Look it up in a thesaurus.",How to Check Spelling," Even if you are the queen in your spelling bee, having a dictionary is absolutely necessary for everyone, for references, synonyms, origins, etc. It's so easy to look up a word in the dictionary. Figure out the first letter and find it.


If you take a language, it may be helpful to get dictionary of that language to your own language. Example: English to Spanish dictionary.
You can always use an online dictionary, but nothing beats an old fashioned, hard copy of a dictionary.





;
, Somebody has to know how to spell the word you are looking for. Ask a classmate, teacher, parent, etc. Just say, ""How do you spell..."" It's that simple. If they don't know, ask someone else, or look it up.

, The internet or the dictionary application is an efficient and easy way to find the spelling and definition of a word. If you type in the word, and it's the wrong spelling, it will suggest a better spelling, because someone else in the world must have spelled it the way you did.

, Go with your gut and choose the best guess. It's a great way to perfect further mistakes: learning from them! Don't rely on this way, and do have another source you can check the spelling from, but if you're in a hurry, take a guess. Even on hard words this works; unless it's one with many vowels, this is usually easy. Don't guess if you're really not sure, though.

, If you really can't figure out how to spell it no matter how many sources you've tried, find a different word. Seek for one that means the same thing but is spelled in a different, easier way. Who knows...this one might even fit better.

, If you know the meaning of a word yet not sure of its spelling and don't know where to start, try searching with the meaning instead. An online thesaurus works wonders!"

Close the door.,
Switch the phone to answering machine or voicemail.,
Don't check emails while you're in non-interruption mode.,
Use your body language to convey an end to a conversation attempted after you've been interrupted.,
Have an office meeting to discuss interruptions in the office.",How to Cope With Office Interruptions," If you have an actual office, close the door when you need to get something done. Make it absolutely clear, either by sign or by oral discussion with colleagues, that when the door is closed, you're out of bounds but when it's open, you can be interrupted. Be sure to make a good balance between shut and open door times though; no shutting yourself off all of the time!


For those working in cubicles, it's a lot harder to create a physical barrier to shut people out for a set period. Perhaps try using a sign that says ""Please don't interrupt the flow until 3pm"" or move your chair, a bookcase, a filing cabinet, large plant or something else in such a way that makes it hard for anyone to get near you or at least indicates that your privacy is currently paramount.;
, Don't take calls for set periods of time when you need to get something done.

, That way, you can get on with things without being sidelined by usually non-urgent email messages.

, If someone does wander into your office or over to your desk, try this simple solution. After hearing out their first few sentences, simply stand up. Don't move away or say anything, just stand up. This is such a pace changer that the other person will get the message that they need to wrap up and move on.

, Develop codes together for indicating politely when a person doesn't wish to be interrupted.

Determine if you need an all-in-one photocopier.,
Ensure that your photocopier can handle every paper size you need.,
Calculate the benefits.,
Choose the copy control features you need.",How to Buy a Photocopier for an Office1," Consider whether you need only a photocopier or a machine that will also serve as a printer, scanner and fax. Although a multi-function machine will be more expensive, you may ultimately save money over buying a separate scanner, fax and printer. It will also be desirable if your current multi-function machine isn't keeping up with the needs of your staff.


The ability to make color copies will add to the cost of your photocopier. If you only occasionally make color copies, you may want to buy a small multifunction machine to make them rather than add the feature to a large photocopier.;
, If you need copies on sizes commonly used outside the United States, such as A-series or B-series sizes, or on unusual sizes such as folio or junior legal, you will want a copier that will accommodate them.

, Weigh the cost of features that allow copies to be made and finished quickly against the cost of having staff members wait for copies and finish them by hand.


Copy speed refers to how quickly the photocopier can scan the original document and produce a copy.
Paper capacity varies from trays that hold less than a ream (500 sheets) of paper to those that will hold as many as 10 reams. You should also consider whether you want multiple paper trays, each holding a different size paper, or a tray that can be adjusted for different sizes. Refilling and adjusting paper trays can be time-consuming for your staff.
Automatic document feeders allow staff members to copy multiple pages without being forced to lift the lid of the photocopier, remove the page just copied and replace it with a new page. This can mean a significant savings in time. Most automatic document feeders will also turn the pages over and copy the reverse sides.
Finishers offer a variety of sorting options. They can also automatically staple, fold or punch holes in copies.

,


You can get a photocopier that requires each staff member to enter an identification code before making copies. This will allow you to break down your photocopier expenses by department or staff member. You can also have your photocopier require a client or job code if you want to include copying expenses in invoices to your clients.
If security is a concern, you can acquire a photocopier that will not retain any information about the documents being copied in memory.

Have employees create a team-building activity.,
Host office potlucks.,
Start a sports league.,
Consider hosting a charity event.",How to Build Teamwork in the Office," At its core, a team is a group of people working together to accomplish a shared goal. In any teamwork-building effort, you'll need to remind your employees that they need to work together to accomplish that common goal.Remind employees why the team they're on exists, and emphasize the importance of collaboration and cooperation.
Prioritize team efforts based on the common goal being worked towards.
Consider creating a motto, award, or motivational poster that emphasizes and rewards teamwork.;
, In addition to having a shared goal, you may want to consider drafting a vision statement for your employees to follow. Your vision statement should reiterate the importance of teamwork, shared values, and inclusion in the workplace.Your vision statement should specify what inclusion should look like in the workplace.
Try to establish specific behavioral expectations of your team. These expectations should foster a trusting, open, and cooperative environment.
Give concrete recommendations for your employees. Don't use abstractions or metaphor; be clear, concise, and specific.

, As a manager or supervisor, your role is sort of a coach to your employees. But each employee should have a role as well. These roles should be clear to the employees, and should help work towards the shared goal you have for your company.Review each employee's role from time to time, and remind your employees what their roles are.
Reiterate responsibilities and expectations when delegating work and assignments.
Help your employees find ways to help one another.

, Miscommunication is threatening to the wellbeing of any organization. It could cause the team of employees to lose focus, trust, and morale.It's better to accidentally over-communicate than to risk under-communicating.
Try to understand every aspect of the issue at hand.
Clarify errors and clear up misunderstandings as soon as they arise.
Reinforce teamwork and cooperation, and recognize your employees' efforts.

, At some point, if you oversee operations and lead a team of employees, you may encounter someone who rejects teamwork and has a hard time being a team player. This person may be a ""loner"" type, or might simply not believe in the shared goals you've laid out for your employees. No matter what the situation may be, you'll need to address this behavior head-on to prevent your other employees from being affected.Have a calm, direct conversation with your employee to address his behavior. Explain why his behavior is a problem, and encourage him to modify his behavior for the betterment of your work environment.
Remind your employee that he's part of a team, and he must embrace the ethics and morale of that team.
Try creating a special niche role for your employee that he can successfully and productively fill. Take his experience, skills, and length of employment into account when designing a role for him.

, Before you turn your employees loose in a round of team-building exercises, it's important to establish what the point of each activity is and what you hope to accomplish with it. Activities can (and arguably should) be fun, but they should ultimately serve a purpose and strengthen the bonds between your employees.Make sure your goals determine the activity you choose. Don't waste time with aimless activities just because they're fun.Communicate to your staff in advance what the purpose of each activity is., One way to foster stronger communication between coworkers is to use children's building blocks to design small sculptures. This requires observation skills, strong leadership abilities, and group communication.


Break your employees up into small teams (no more than four people per team).
Build a small sculpture using children's building blocks. Make sure the sculpture is hidden from the teams.
Hand out the necessary building blocks to each team.
Choose one instructor from each team (perhaps supervisors or managers) to come up and view the sculpture at the same time. Their remaining team members should remain at their stations, out of view of the sculpture.
Each instructor may only view the sculpture for 10 seconds at a time. After 10 seconds they must all return to their groups and direct their team mates on how to complete the sculpture., A good way to build trust between coworkers is by having one employee lead another. This is an excellent opportunity to pair together people who don't get along or don't trust one another.


Set up an obstacle course using chairs, boxes, cones, and anything else you might have lying around the office - just be sure you don't use any objects that could hurt someone.
Split your employees into pairs. Again, focus on pairing together people who might not work well together normally, as this is an opportunity to improve their relationship.
Blindfold one person, and instruct him not to talk.
Have his partner lead him through the obstacle course by giving verbal directions only. The goal is to have each blindfolded employee make it through the obstacles and reach the far side of the course., A good team activity for your employees is the ""watch your back"" exercise. This forces your employees to work together, have patience for one another, and coordinate their movements to work as a team. You can instruct your employees to carry over the coordination and patience they have for one another during this exercise into their day to day work lives.Make a start line and a finish line.
Instruct everyone to stand side-by-side with their arms linked at the elbows.
While keeping their arms linked, have your employees move together as a unit towards the finish line without losing anyone.
To really build patience, you can time them and have your employees repeat the exercise until they can get to the finish line under a certain time limit. Figure out a time limit that is both challenging but realistic for the distance you're expecting them to cover.

, Having your employees devise and implement their own original team exercise can change things up and get your employees motivated to succeed. It also requires teamwork in and of itself, as each group of employees must work together to develop an activity and agree on how best to design it.Create a fake problem. Tell your employees that you were going to spend an hour doing a problem solving activity, but you didn't want them to rehash something they've done before in the past.
Have each group of employees devise their own unique problem-solving activity. They'll need to work together and form some type of consensus on whether the activity will work.
Once each group has come up with their own activity, have each group of employees participate in one another's exercises.

, Buying your employees a meal (like a pizza party) from time to time can help boost morale. But hosting a potluck might be even more effective at fostering a sense of teamwork and cooperation. Each employee will participate and work together to feed the staff with their own specialty, which also works as a metaphor for inter-office cooperation.Announce the potluck a week or two in advance so that your employees can buy and prepare whatever foods they'll need.
Ask your employees where their culinary strengths lie, and encourage them to create their own healthy, delicious contributions.

, Team work is a vital part of office productivity. It's also a natural part of team sports, which explains why so many offices host after work sports leagues. Starting a softball or bowling league can give your employees a chance to work together as a team while also relaxing and enjoying some down time together.Talk to other offices in your area and see if they'd be interested in joining a friendly recreational sports league.
If other offices aren't interested, consider starting an intramural league that only involves your employees.
Contact local venues (like ball parks and bowling alleys) to find out how to start a league, and ask about discounts available for larger teams.

, Another great way to have your employees bond while working towards a shared goal is a charity event. You can organize your own event, or sign up your employees to join in with an existing event.If you're starting your own event, seek feedback from your team. Talk to your employees, and ask them to vote on an event to participate in, as well as a charity to benefit from that event.
Have employees who are interested in participating raise money or collect donations. Don't make donations mandatory, but remind your employees how important it is to help out the charity they choose.
You can join a walkathon, for example, or simply offer your employees the opportunity to volunteer with an existing charity.

Buy a small, inexpensive photocopier, especially if you can afford to buy its replacement as well.,
Lease large, expensive photocopiers.",How to Buy a Photocopier for an Office2," The least expensive photocopiers will last several years without needing maintenance, but when they do malfunction, you may not be able to find a repair service.

, This allows you to avoid a large capital expense. Leasing often includes a service contract that will allow for regular preventive maintenance and the ability to have a repair person dispatched quickly in case of malfunction. Leasing also allows you to upgrade your copier as technology and your needs change.

A lamp is just not a source of light on your reading table.,Factors to Consider When Selecting a Desk Lamp

And just like with any other accessory, there are a lot of choices or varieties of desk lamps to choose from. Here we are going to explore how to select the right desk lamps, as well as what considerations you should factor before the actual process.;
,,, Most people just eyeball the size of the area that the lamp will be set. This usually results in the buyer actually having remorse, as the lamp does not fit well. To avoid this catastrophic scenario, it is advisable to appropriately measure the table height and the tableâs circumference. The desk lamp should not overlap the desk.

, The lamp should be heavy and sturdy, if your desk is located near where kids play or where people pass through to get from one spot to another in the room. This way it will be harder to knock over the desk lamp and damage it. However, if the location is not too âbusyâ you can opt for a lighter desk lamp.

,, The lamp has to fit in with your dÃ©cor, or it will stick out like a sore thumb. There are so many styles to choose from, but here are just a few: Modern, Classic, and Global. The classic types have a traditional feel to them, plus the 3 were designed many years ago. Have a look around the room and see which color or style of lamp would best suit the desk and the area around it. The modern types of lamps have a sleek design, and are meant to blend appropriately with todayâs heavily polished metals.

, A crystal base on a lamp adds a hint of glamour to the desk. An iron base will provide richness. You can also go for a lamp with a clear base, so as to create an illusion that the desk has less weight on top of it. For a more traditional old school feel, which is also luxurious, you can purchase a lamp that has a porcelain base. You can also go exotic with a Moroccan based lamp, which is a wonderful choice despite how basic your dÃ©cor might be.

,, The primary function of the desk lamp is to provide light at the desk for you to see clearly. The task of the lamp is intertwined with the task of the desk. Most desks and their lamps are meant for reading. In this case, you should select a desk lamp with a translucent shade such as quality paper shades. If the lamp is meant to brighten the room or just for decorative purposes, then select a lamp that has opaque shading. This lamp will cast the light from the floor to the ceiling, but not outwards. Shades are important on the lamps, because an exposed bulb can produce a glare that is dangerous to your eyes.

, Obviously, if the task of the lamp is to assist you while reading or drawing, then the lamp should have a higher wattage. If the lamp is basically a decorative fixture, then the wattage of the bulb in the lamp should be slightly lower.

,, There are two choices here; swiveled, or fixed. Swiveled desk lamps allow you to shift the direction of the light source as you see fit. The fixed desk lamp is stationery, but it will always illuminate in the general direction that you want it to.

Find the number of unemployed people.,
Find the number of employed people.,
Remove people who are not considered to be in the labor force.,
Divide the number of unemployed people by the total number of employed and unemployed people.,
Multiply the decimal number by 100 to get the percentage.,
Find the employment rate by subtracting this number from 100.",How to Calculate Unemployment Rate1," ""Unemployed"" people are defined by the federal government as people who are able to work and who have actively looked for work in the last four weeks.


Actively looking for work fits a broad category that includes having contacted an employer directly with a resume or through an interview, going to a public or private employment agency, asking friends or relatives for work opportunities, going to a school employment center, placing advertisements looking for work, or filling out job applications.People who are unemployed, but who have stopped looking for work because they don't believe they can find one in their line of work, they were previously unable to find work, or because they feel they are too old, or too inexperienced to work, are considered to be ""marginally attached to the labor force"" and are therefore not considered to be part of the labor force.
The federal government finds this number through surveying 60,000 US households every month.;
, The employed population of a nation is accounted for by people who have full-time jobs. They are also considered to be employed if they are self-employed, if they work part-time, or if they work for a family business for more than 15 hours a week, even if the work is unpaid. People who are on maternity or paternity leave, on sabbatical, or on vacation from work are also considered employed because they do have a job to come back to.


Even if a person is employed part-time or works in a job below his or her pay grade, that person is still considered to be employed.
The federal government also finds this number through surveying 60,000 US households every month., People who are not part of the labor force are people who are not actively looking for work or people who are otherwise occupied, whether they are students, homemakers, or disabled. People who are not part of the labor force include people under 16 years of age, people in institutions, such as prisons and nursing homes, people in the armed forces, people who are retired, students, and the disabled.


It's important to know which people are not considered to be part of the labor force so that you don't mistakenly count them as part or not part of the labor force and skew the equation.

, For example, if we have 4 million unemployed people and 40 million employed people, we can divide 4 by 44 and get a decimal of .09.


Note that, when calculating the real unemployment, the figure will not be so nice and neat.
You may notice that the original numbers were in millions but we dropped all the zeros, choosing just to divide the prefixes. If you divide the numbers with their full digits in the millions you will actually get the same exact decimal. Try it, you'll see!

, This calculation is as easy as moving your decimal point two spaces to the left, for example converting .09 into 9%.

, If you want to take it a step further and would like to find out what the employment rate is, then all you have to do is take the unemployment rate and subtract it from 100.


So, for example, 100 - 9 = 91. This means that the employment rate of our fictional land is 90%, or that 90 percent of the people who are able to work and able to find work have found it. That sounds a bit nicer, doesn't it?

Give your brain a break.,
Fill your surroundings with positive things.To reduce stress, it is recommended that you create a âzenâ space in your office.,
Get some exercise.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat right.,
Check on the ergonomics of your work area.,
Vary your activity and sitting or standing position from time to time throughout the day.,
Organize your time.,
Keep germs away.",How to Build Healthy Office Habits," Often, life at the office is not physically demanding, but mentally draining. The pressure to meet tight deadlines not only takes a toll on your mental happiness, but also on your bodyâs physical comfort. The effects of stress are never positive. People who are stressed out are less productive and less energetic in the workspaceâcharacteristics that no boss appreciates in his or her employees.


Use the same time to give your legs, arms, eyes, and back a break, as well. Step away from your screen for at least a minute or two every hour.
Install a program on your computer or phone to remind you to take breaks. Workrave is a free program which tracks your mouse and keyboard time, and gives a reminder at intervals you set, for short (30 second) breaks and for longer (3 to 5 minute) breaks. Some programs, including this one, also suggest simple exercises to perform during breaks. If you tend to get heavily focused on computer work, give this program, or something like it, a try.;
, Keep a plant, goldfish, or a couple of sentimental pictures on your desk; such items will make you feel more at ease in your office space. The more relaxed you feel at work, the more level-headed you will be when completing important work-related tasks.

, Take full advantage of the office supplies around you during your work breaks. You can use an office chair to stretch your abs, back and legs. It might sound totally silly, but you can even use a bunch of copy paper to do arm lift-ups. Donât forget to stretch your neck and wrists as well. All of these exercises are crucial to your bodyâs well-being.


Take advantage of your building, too. Take the stairs to come and go. Park further from the door.Try using a break room or washroom on a different floor, or walking the long way around to get to the printer or copier.

, Make sure that you are drinking enough water to keep yourself hydrated. Water helps each cell in your body absorb nutrients and expel waste products. Moreover, drinking water can help you lose weight; water can help suppress your appetite, so that you donât mindlessly snack and pack on the pounds! Sitting for long periods of time can cause you to easily gain weight around your waist and legs., Keep some healthy break room supply snacks with you while working. Popping a cherry tomato or baby carrot into your hungry mouth might quell the urge to purchase a candy bar at the vending machine.



Bring your own lunch and healthy snacks so you decide exactly what you eat.

, Even if you have improved it once, you may need to make adjustments, particularly if your work habits or most frequent tasks change. Also check that you are working with neutral, relaxed body position, and not overreaching, bending, or leaning against hard or sharp edges.

,


Consider a standing desk, especially the sort which will adjust to let you alternate between sitting or standing.

, If you can get your work done while you're supposed to be there, you may not have to stay late or give up parts of your weekends just to keep ahead of it. If you consistently have more than you can handle, see if it's possible to hire more people to help.

, To keep germs away from you, follow these tips:


Wipe your desk with disinfectant wipes
Donât eat at your desk without a plate or napkin.
Wash your dishes and utensils regularly.

Clean your keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and mousepad periodically. Clean your telephone if you use it.

Wash your hands before and after leaving work, and after using the bathroom; and
Sanitize often.

Find the number of employed and unemployed people using the federal standards.,
Calculate the federal unemployment rate.,
Calculate alternative unemployment percentages.,
Add the alternative unemployment percentage to the federal unemployment rate.",How to Calculate Unemployment Rate2," You can use the federal bureau of labor statistics numbers, which are calculated through a survey of 60,000 households every month.As stated in method one, the number of unemployed workers does not include all those without work, but instead only counts those that have ""actively"" looked for work in the last four weeks and fit other specific parameters outlined by the federal government.

, In order to calculate this percentage you will need to calculate the federal unemployment rate by dividing the number of people who are actively seeking employment, but who cannot find a job, by the total number of people who are employed and those seeking employment. Follow method one to complete this calculation.

, The federal unemployment rate does not give the full picture of the true number of people who do not have an employment.A person who has not actively sought work in 4 weeks, even if he has thought about it or even perused ads about it, does not count as unemployed, and is considered not part of the labor force. If you would like to calculate a more accurate percentage of people who are without work you will need to add some of those not included in the federal calculation.


To calculate those who are unemployed but who have not searched for a job in the last four weeks, the percentage should only include those that want and are available for work, as opposed to those that are permanently unemployed, such as the retired.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics makes this type of data available on their website, in addition to the more traditional data they use for calculating unemployment. It can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm


, This number gives a fuller picture of the percentage of people who are without employment.

Greet guests with a smile.,
Assess your guests and their needs.,
Make light conversation with your guests.,
Enquire about your guestsâ stay.",How to Work the Front Desk at a Hotel2," Your face is the first thing hotel guests will see upon arriving, which makes you the ambassador for the hotel. So it is very important that you are smiling while working the front desk, especially when you greet guests. A genuine smile will help guests feel happy and welcomed about checking-in.To personalize the experience for your guests, refer to them by a title and their last name, for example, Mr. Smith.

, While you are checking guests in, ask them questions about their stay so you can anticipate any future needs. Additionally, use cues like body language to ensure that your guests have a comfortable stay while at the hotel.For example, ask your guests if their stay is for leisure or work.

Clear your schedule.,
Prepare all documents.,
Learn procedures.,
Get to know the managers personally.,
Starting your first day.",How to Work at Wendy's," You're most likely to get hired if you can work any time any day; this gives you points with the managers right off the bat. If you can't give all of yourself, try to give as much as possible. Keep in mind that if you are in school, especially if you tend to procrastinate, work may interfere with your studies; don't be afraid to ask for less hours, at least give a week's notice if you are going to be absent.;
, This means having an ID (Driver's License or Passport), your Social Security Card, bank account number and other necessary documents to your work orientation. Any other documents needed will be mentioned during the interview.

, Know all of them by the book - this means the managers can count on you to be their right hand person and that's who you want to be. Don't be afraid to ask questions during your first few months, just don't ask when a manager is busy.

, They are an excellent source of information, and will begin to guide you in the proper direction. Some managers are okay with being friendly, but some may be inclined to be more professional. Respect both and remember that the manager on duty sets the tone for the shift. Don't expect special treatment just because a manager is friendly- they are still your superior, and it is their job to ensure you are doing yours.

, Even if you know how to do everything already, allow the manager(s) to show you how it's done. This may be annoying, but you may learn a thing or two you didn't already know before. You will probably start with the fry station. Cook it as you normally would, dump it into the tray, salt it and mix. The 4 sizes used are kids/value, small, medium and large (formerly Biggie). Cook quickly and make sure to not waste fries; remember, if it's not busy, only one batch per tray. The two nugget types are regular and spicy, the size choices are 4.PC, 6 piece and 10-piece, which go in the value, small and medium cartons, respectively.

Scope out the scene.,
Greet the table.,
Bring the drinks to the table.,
Take their order.,
Ask the parents if they want the childrenâs food to come out before the rest of the meal.,
Give the child their food first.,
Keep hot plates away from children.,
Talk to the children.,
Check on the table periodically throughout their entire meal.,
Thank them.",How to Wait on a Table With Children at a Restaurant," This may sound odd but that is exactly what you do. Determine the age of the children. See how they are acting before you walk over to the table.;
, You will greet them the same as you would any other table-introducing yourself and asking for drink orders. Talk to the child just as you would the adult, making them feel important too.

, Children always receive their drinks first. This is an important rule! Parents serve their children before they serve themselves and you should do the same. (The parents will for sure notice this!)

, Ask the children what they would like first. Most of the time the parents will order for them but asking doesnât hurt anything. Continue with the rest of the order as usual.

, The order the food comes out is the same in most restaurants. Appetizers, salads/soup, entrees, and then dessert. When there are children involved you should always ask if they want it put in early or wait until the rest of the entrees come out. Parents notice the extra gesture and like the options you have opened up. How the parents answer the question will determine if you wait or bring it out first.

, If the food comes out with the others, hand out the childrenâs food before the others. The same rule that applied with the drinks applies with the food!

, When handing out the food, there is a good chance the plate will be hot. If that is the case, warn the parents and do not place it within arms reach of the kid. Every parent will be very unhappy if their child burns their hand because of the serverâs incompetence.

, Depending on the age of the child will determine the conversation. If they are playing with a toy, comment on it. Ask questions and be interested in the answer. Parents love when the children are entertained, so that is exactly your goal. Entertain the kids even if it is just for a few minutes!

, Do not hover but do not be negligent either. Get them refills if necessary and anything else they may need to enjoy their meal.

, Always thank the people for coming into the restaurant and invite them back. Make sure you personally tell the children bye! Adults are fine with a group farewell but children are not.

Go directly to hotel websites for job opportunities.,
Consider whether your experience matches the duties of the job you're seeking.,
Think creatively to get the job you want.,
Start at the bottom, if you have to.",How to Work at a Hotel," Hotel jobs are abundant, and properties update open positions every day. Dig a little further when you search for jobs at major hotel chains that have more than 1 local property. Go to each individual hotel's home page. A job you're interested in might be open at one franchise but not another.;
, What experience do you have that's relevant to a specific job in the hospitality industry? Many hotel jobs are directly correlated to positions outside the hospitality industry. Restaurant workers often find work at hotels waiting tables, tending bar or preparing meals. Experienced landscapers can find full-time work at large properties. But even if your skills aren't directly transferable, you may be able to emphasize your relevant skills. If you have experience in telemarketing, you may be able to secure a position in reservations. If you can demonstrate superior organizational skills and the ability to multi-task you may be qualified to work at the front desk.

, Consider your areas of expertise beyond conventional job skills. Luxury hotels, in particular, have to meet the specific recreational needs of their guests. If you've earned a professional license or vocational certificate, or if you simply have a vast knowledge of the region, you may be able to find a specialized role in the hotel industry. Some of these jobs include:


Tour guide: Some hotels will offer guided tours of local attractions. People who can demonstrate a deep understanding of the region or specific activities can sometimes find jobs as guides. Avid anglers can parlay their expertise into roles as fishing guides. Some resorts may need experienced outdoors men to lead groups through rugged local terrain. If you are fluent in a foreign language ï¿½ particularly Chinese, Japanese or Spanish ï¿½ you may be able to find work leading groups of tourists from overseas.
Local pro: Golf and tennis resorts cater to active guests. Properties with adjacent golf courses usually have a PGA-certified professional on site to provide lessons and regulate play. Hotels with large tennis facilities will often employ a pro to oversee operations and provide instruction to guests.
Lifeguard: Luxury resorts often have large pools open to guests until the late evening. Many hotels will have a lifeguard on duty at all times to make sure that the pool is enjoyed safely.
Massage therapist: After 18 holes of golf or 3 sets of tennis, guests may opt for a relaxing massage. Many hotels are expanding the features they offer to include on-site massages. If you hold a credential in massage therapy, you may be able to find a full- or part-time position at a top resort.
Nurse: Huge resorts will often keep a licensed nurse on the premises to respond to guests' acute health issues 24 hours a day. This provides an excellent moonlighting opportunity for registered and licensed-vocational nurses or other health-care professionals.
Housekeeper: Most hotel employees work in housekeeping. Retired homemakers usually can transition into housekeeping positions very easily. Trustworthiness might be the most important quality in a hotel maid since they usually enter rooms when guests have left for the day's activities.
Sales: While you may have a background in product sales, hotel chains require sales associates to demonstrate a thorough understanding of their pricing strategy, group packages and demand generators.

, Many managers encourage workers to learn the hotel business from the ground up. This gives employees a better understanding and appreciation of all facets of the industry. Entry-level workers are regularly pulled off front-desk duties to bus tables, deliver room-services meals, or tend to any other guest needs. All new hotel workers can expect to draw graveyard shifts. Overnight duties often provide the best learning opportunities for new hotel employees, forcing workers to make decisions covering the full range of hotel functions.

Appreciate the flexibility.,
Enjoy the social interaction.,
Welcome the fast pace.",How to Make the Best of Working in a Fast Food Restaurant2," Since fast food restaurants are open all week, typically for many hours a day, employee work schedules are usually flexible.This industry is especially accommodating to employees who want extra hours, an opportunity that is not always available with a strict 9 to 5 schedule. Take advantage of the opportunity to work at different times of the day and request shifts outside of typical work day hours; this will allow you to avoid rush hour hassles, and possibly cut down the time of your commute., Working in the service industry provides you with an opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. You're likely learning how to read people, which is a valuable skill; additionally, the camaraderie and fun you may develop with your fellow employees doesn't exist in all working environments. Social interaction is a crucial part of human life and is thought to be a factor in extending lifespan.To bond with co-workers, try:


organizing after-work outings
sitting with them during your breaks
participating in team-building activities sponsored by the company (charity events, sports, etc.)starting discussions about workplace experiences (e.g. ""I just served a really difficult customer. How do you deal with that kind of situation?"")

, Most jobs are stationary - in other words, many people have desk jobs where they are required to sit for long periods of time. Sitting for too many consecutive hours on a regular basis can result in neck and back pain, an increased risk of heart disease, poor posture, and difficulty concentrating.To avoid getting overwhelmed by the fast pace of your fast food job, take advantage of your break time to regroup, relax, and focus on your breathing.Having a job that requires physical activity not only makes the time pass quickly, but it keeps your body active.


Make sure to take care of your feet; buy a pair of comfortable shoes and breathable socks to prevent injury and hygiene issues while you're on your feet for long periods of time."

Working on days that you would prefer not to shows dedication, loyalty, and professionalism - qualities that will earn you recognition from your supervisors. In addition, postponing your own celebrations will allow you to celebrate during off-peak times, which can be less hectic and expensive., Working in the service industry means that you will inevitably encounter angry or rude customers from time to time. Remember that this is part of your job and not something that you should take to heart; customers donât know you personally, they can only speak to their experience of the product or service you are providing. Do your best to handle each difficult situation in the best, most professional way you can and, if possible, take a few minutes to yourself if a situation really gets you down., One of the biggest disadvantages of working at a fast food restaurant is the low wage you are likely to be earning. Do what you can to make the most of your money; work out a firm budget for your spending, open an account at a bank with low fees, and shop around for a high-interest savings account. These efforts to bolster your savings will make a difference over time.You may also take advantage of the non-monetary rewards of your fast food job, like free or discounted food and drinks.

Listen to the guest.Let the customer say everything they need to say.,
Try to picture the problem as the customer explains it.For instance, a customer may say, âI was eating my soup and there were several little peas in it which were quite hard.â In your mindâs eye, envision the soup in question.,
Clarify what the customer says.,
Stay calm and show youâre concerned.,
Apologize to the customer.,
Act quickly when handling a complaint.When a customer has a complaint, no matter how serious, correcting it should take priority over anything else.,
Solve the problem.Solutions take a variety of forms, each dependent on the specific situation.,
Share information about the customerâs complaint with your teammates.For instance, if a customer says the soup is too salty, you should inform the cook who made the soup.,
Thank the guest for bringing the issue to your attention.Many customers might be too considerate or too proud to complain about their experience.",How to Handle Customer Complaints About Food," If they are interrupted, they may feel the need to start over. Nod to show youâre actively engaged in what they have to say and that you empathize with their predicament. Be attentive but relaxed. Look the customer in the eye as they speak.


Keep an open mind when listening to the customer.In other words, donât listen for what you think the problem is or might be. Rather, hear the customer out and understand their actual problem or issues.
Donât contradict or argue with what the customer says. Even if they are wrong, informing them of their error will only exacerbate their frustration.
Do not minimize the customerâs complaint. Do not, for instance, say âSometimes food is a little cold when it comes out. Itâs no big deal.â This will not make the customer happy.;
, Imagine the peas. Are they large or small? Round and smooth, or somewhat dimpled? Are they bright green, or more of a pine color? Finally, the texture. Imagine you have several between your hand which are soft and pliant. Several others are hard and undesirable in soup. You will better understand the customerâs problem armed with this mental vision.

, There are two ways to clarify a customer complaint in order to better understand and handle it. The first way is to ask questions about the complaint.The second way is to repeat the customerâs complaint back to them in different language.


For instance, if youâve just arrived for your shift and a customer is complaining about the soup, you might not know what soup the customer is referring to. Ask questions as needed. You might inquire, âDid you have the pea soup or the vegetable noodle?â Donât assume which menu item the customer is talking about; always follow up by asking for specifics as they explain their issue.
Once the customerâs complaint has been explained, repeat it back to them in different language.For instance, the customer might complain that the food was cold. You could, after hearing the explanation, summarize their problem by saying, âSo your food did not arrive at the temperature you wanted it to be at? Is that right?â If they agree, youâve listened well and can move on to fixing the problem.

, Do not smile or laugh while listening to the customerâs complaint. Adopt a solicitous, concerned facial expression. Furrow your brow slightly in the center and turn down the corners of your mouth. This will make the customer feel as if you are truly concerned about what they have to say.


Even if the customer is using profanity or yelling rudely, do not respond in kind. Exercise patience and compassion. Listen patiently to the entirety of the customerâs complaint.
If they are being particularly boisterous, direct the customer to follow you into a more private quarter of the dining establishment. There you can continue to listen to their tirade without drawing negative attention to the situation or disrupting the other diners., An apology is an acknowledgment that you made a mistake.Tell the customer, âI am so sorry for the error.â This will make the customer more inclined to forgive you and/or your restaurant. Be specific in your apology. If the soup was too cold, say âI am sorry the soup was too cold.â If the order was wrong, say, âI am sorry I brought you the wrong order.â


Always act sincere when apologizing, even if there is no real reason for you to apologize. It will make the customer feel better.
Many customers appreciate an explanation, but do not appreciate excuses. For instance, you could say âIâm sorry, the line cook was confused about your order. Iâll fix it immediately.â But do not say, âThe line cook mixed it up, not me. Just hang on while he fixes it.â Maintain a sense of personal responsibility even if the problem is not your fault, and avoid excusing yourself or anyone else.
If you are very sorry, emphasize how sorry you feel by saying âI am very sorry this happened.â
Apologies work online too. If your establishment is active on review sites like Google+ or Yelp, you can write apologies in response to bad experiences. Write something like, âWe are sorry you had a bad experience in our dining establishment. I can understand why you were frustrated. We will investigate this matter in depth to ensure it does not happen again. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.â

, If a customer is waiting to order and another customer has a complaint, the customer with the complaint should be helped first. Only after their complaint has been heard and an apology issued should the other customerâs order be taken.


If the customerâs complaint involved re-making a dish, ensure that this remake goes to the front of the order list in the kitchen. Let kitchen staff know that they need to make the order a priority.
If it is not possible to resolve the customerâs complaint in a way which satisfies them quickly or within the time they have completed their meal, get their contact info so that they can be contacted later with a solution. For instance, if the customer orders takeout and doesnât have his order ready when he comes to pick it up, and doesnât have time to wait for it to be made, tell him to write down his name and number and he will be eligible for a free order of equal value later at a time of his choosing.

, Thinking about the customerâs mood, the customerâs problem, and the options available to you to solve it will dictate your course of action.


Ask the customer what theyâd like to have happen to rectify the situation. Consult with your manager or coworkers in order to determine how to move forward. If the customerâs request can be honored, do so. Otherwise, use the information you received from your coworkers or manager in order to propose an alternative to the customer.
Think about how irate the customer is. If theyâre extremely irritated and angry, you should go above and beyond to ensure they are placated. Consider offering them a large discount, 50-100% off their meal.
If the customers is mildly or only slightly put out by the issue about which they are complaining, offer them a free drink or a free side.
If the complaint isnât terribly serious but intended more as an informational aside, such as âThe table is a bit sticky,â you might just need to clean the table up a bit.
Always follow your restaurantâs protocol when deciding how to handle customer complaints. Get your managerâs approval before extending an exceptionally generous offer like a free meal.
Sometimes food just needs to be reheated, sometimes it needs to be completely remade, and sometimes the customer will accept another solution entirely. Regardless, remove the undesired item with the customerâs permission.

, Tell him or her, âOne of my customers found the soup a bit too salty. Would you try it to see if it needs to be adjusted?â While itâs important for you to apologize and offer something else to the customer who complained, if there is a real problem with the soup, someone else will complain about it too, down the line, and then youâll have to go through the whole apology and replacement process again.


Speaking with your coworkers is also important so you can understand what kinds of solutions are possible. For example, if the customer wants a replacement side of mashed potatoes, youâll need to check with the kitchen before assuring the customer that you can replace them. It is possible that the kitchen has sold out of them for the night.

, The customers who do speak up are giving you an opportunity to improve on the dining experience, whether in the avenue of food quality, service, or dining atmosphere. Thank these customers by saying, âThank you so much for bringing this matter to my attention.â

Smile at everyone and be friendly.,
Come up with an upbeat way to greet your tables.,
Know the menu, especially if you work in fine dining.,
Bring out drinks right away.,
Serve the different courses in the proper order.,
Check back with your guests but don't be annoying.,
Ask if the guests would like dessert when they are done with their meals.,
Clear away any dishes as the guests finish each course.,
Offer boxes when someone has food left over on her plate.,
Try not to clean directly next to the your tables.",How to Get Bigger Tips as a Server," Guests like it when they feel their server is approachable. Smiles are also contagious, putting your customers in a good mood and increasing your tips.;
, If you sound bored or like you hate your job, they aren't likely to tip you very much. Let your guests know you will take care of their needs.

, People will sometimes ask how a specific dish tastes or what you recommend, so prepare yourself to answer these questions. You also need to know what ingredients are in each dish, as people do have food allergies and special requests. Saving a vegan from a dish made with chicken stock will boost your tip.

, Take the drink order, go get the drinks and come back after allowing the guests to look over the menu for a minute. Also bring out any complementary starters your restaurants serves, like bread or chips.

, If a customer orders an appetizer, that needs to come out first; don't bring the salads until they are done or almost done with their appetizer. Likewise, don't bring out the entrees right after bringing out the salads. Proper spacing between meals will make the guest more comfortable; rushing him will reduce your tip. If you need to, wait to send the entrÃ©e order to the kitchen to allow for the proper timing.

, After you serve the entrÃ©e, check back within two minutes to see if everything is cooked properly and if they need anything else, like condiments or napkins. Stay within a close radius so you can see if they ever start looking around like they need something. Always refill drinks as soon as they start getting low.

, In many cases, customers won't order dessert unless specifically asked; the high dollar value of desserts will add to the ticket and boost your tip. If they say no, offer to put it in a to-go box for them, but don't be pushy.

, This is called pre-bussing, and doing this will give the guests more room to spread out, which puts them at ease. Too many dishes makes the table feel cluttered and frustrates the guests. Wait to clear all of entrÃ©e dishes once everyone has finished. Clearing one or a few dishes but not all can often make guests who eat more slowly feel rushed or uncomfortable. This is never done at a fine dining establishment.

, Sometimes, people are willing to pay the high prices for dining out assuming they'll have leftovers for lunch the next day.

, While you may have to clean your section before you can clock out, you don't want to do it at the expense of your final tips.

Remember you are there to serve the customer.,
Be quick.,
Always smile.,
Write down your order.,
Never disagree with your customer.,
Do not touch the guests.,
Remember tipping is subjective.",How to Make Good Tips As a Waiter," As a server, in order to get big fat tips the first thing that we must remember is that we are there to serve. Let the needs of the customer guide you through your table service. Do what they need and ask and you will be rewarded handsomely.;
, Speed is essential to get good tips. The faster we can fulfill the wish of a guest, the happier they will be, and that's what it's all about isn't it? Making our guests happy? Yes it is! If they ask for something, do it immediately. Drop whatever it is you are doing and reply to the request. Do not worry that your bladder is full to aching and you have not had time to go to the restroom for six hours. If table seven demands more bread, do it right away! Your wallet will thank you later.

, Customers need to think you are enjoying waiting on them. It is important that you hide any disdain you may have for them because it will surely affect your tip. Plaster a big fake smile on your face and keep it there the whole time you are wearing your apron. You might want to try putting Vaseline on your teeth because it will remind you to keep that happy expression. Hey, if it works for Miss America, it can work for you, so smile darn ya, smile!

, Customers tend to think that we servers are ignorant and incapable of doing anything else with our lives, despite many of us having advanced college degrees. If you write down the order, the guest will have confidence that their order will come out the way they wanted it. Even if they only ask for a house salad with ranch dressing, at least pretend to write it down on your pad. Simply scribble a note or a doodle or maybe even something like, ""Oh man, this guy thinks I'm stupid."" The customer will see you diligently writing in your pad and take note of it.

, The customer is always right in every single possible situation known to mankind and cannot ever under any circumstances ever in a million years be wrong. It just is not possible. If they tell you that their food took 45 minutes to get to them and you know that it only took 18 because you can look at the computer to see when you rang it in, just nod your head, smile and agree. Apologize for being such a poor wretch of a human being and then offer them a complimentary dessert.

, You should never touch your guest. Even though there are studies that have shown that by gently touching a customer on the shoulder when giving them their change and thanking them they will give you a slightly higher tipdo not do it. in this day and age, someone can easily misconstrue that touch as something inappropriate.


On the other hand, if a customer touches you, let them, if it is something you are comfortable with. Simply laugh and say ""what can I get you?"" If you show that you did not like a perfect stranger getting into your personal space, they may find that reason enough to give you less of a tip and we do not want that. However, depending on the nature of the touch, you may find that it is not worth the extra tip. Your call.

, If you follow all of these steps, there should be no reason that you won't receive a 20% from your table. Tipping is subjective though, so don't be surprised if instead of a monetary tip you receive a verbal one like, ""You were the best waiter I have ever had!"" or ""I want to write a letter to your manager about how great you were!"" These are called ""lip tips.""

Some cities, like Chicago, have âdry precinctsâ where no establishment can serve liquor. Your local representative will help you identify whether or not you can get a license.

, In the United States, the licensing of alcohol permits often involves both local approval and state-level approval. In many states, you need local approval before you can apply for your state license. You can find your local board in the following ways:


Stop into your town managerâs office. They should have information about who to contact.

Think about your skills. Do you have experience cooking hamburgers and running a deep fryer? Can you roll a burrito by hand? These things will be helpful when you decide where to apply.


Become familiar with the companies where you are applying.Many fast food chains are similar, but some have very specific mission statements and expectations. Know which chains use fresh, locally grown food, which ones are religious affiliated, which ones are open 24 hours, and which ones promote from within. Make sure you will feel comfortable working for the company.
Know the basic requirements. This includes age - do you have to be 16, or can you get a job at 15 with permission? Do you have to have a high school diploma? Do you need experience to land a job?;
, Every company requires you to fill out an application. If you are applying for an entry-level position instead of a managerial or corporate position, you will probably not need to provide a resume. Only give a resume if it is requested by the manager or the online application guidelines. You can find the application one of two ways:


Online. Almost every company provides their application on their website. The website allows you to input your zip code and/or city, then lists the available positions. If there are a lot of positions in your area, you can choose your top location choices.
On site. Visit the fast food place and ask for an application. By going in person, ask if you could talk with the manager. This may give you a higher chance of getting the job. However, some companies prefer you to apply online. If you want to talk to a manager, never go during peak times.

, Set aside at least half an hour to fill out the application. Be truthful on the application.


When applying for a job, make sure you have all of your information ready. You will need your social security number, address, and phone number. You will probably have to provide your education and work history, which may require the phone number and address of the school or employer.
If you are applying by hand, make sure to write neatly.
To apply online, you need to have an e-mail address so you can create a profile and receive notifications. You can obtain a free e-mail address at sites such as gmail.com and yahoo.com.

, Most jobs require at least one reference. This can be either someone who knows you and can vouch for your character, or a previous employer or colleague who can attest to your work ethics.


It is good practice to have at least one personal and one work reference. You may want to have multiple of both. Just make sure the reference is okay with your providing their information. Also make sure the reference will say positive things about you.

, Every job application that you fill out will ask for relevant skills or work related experience. Before you go to apply, think about what you can bring to the restaurant. These skills range from experience in other fast food or food related service, cashier experience, and customer service experience.


Make the most of your experiences, especially if you've never had a job or worked in fast food. You need to demonstrate that you have leadership and teamwork experience, as well as the ability to work under pressure in high stress situations. Think about things you've done in school or other jobs that reflect these qualities.Sample real world situations you can use when listing skills are: participation in team sports, leadership roles in school, church, or community organizations, activities that required you to handle money, jobs where you had to run a cash register, jobs where you had to deal with the public on a regular basis, situations where you had to multi-task, and involvement in high stress situations. Think about instances where you had to work as part of a team, because being part of a fast food crew is about team work. Another qualification is the ability to multi-task, so emphasize your experience with multi-tasking.Be honest when you describe what you are capable of. If you say you can work a grill but have never worked one, it won't take long before they realize you have lied, which can result in termination.

, Depending on the company, the amount of applicants, and the need, it may take a few days to a couple of weeks to get a call for an interview. Wait at least a week before following up. You don't want to annoy the hiring manager. Either call or drop by during non-peak hours to speak about your application., If the company decides not to hire you, keep trying. They may not have any openings at the time or are looking for someone who has fast food service experience.

, Since fast food jobs are not office jobs, you do not need to go over the top. However, business casual attire should be worn to interviews. You want to present your best to place yourself above the rest of the applicants.


No matter what you wear, go to the interview looking clean and neat. Make sure you have showered and that your clothes are clean. Comb your hair and consider pulling it back if it is long.
Go into the interview looking professional by wearing nice clothes. If you are a woman, wear nice slacks, a skirt, a button up, or nice blouse. Do not wear anything too short, too tight, or too low-cut. Do not wear flashy jewelry or inappropriate shoes. If you are a man, choose khakis, a button up, or a nice polo. Don't wear baggy clothes or hats. No one should wear shorts, flip flops, or tank tops., Fast food jobs are customer service centric, so hiring managers are looking for positive people. When answering interview questions, avoid negative answers. Smile and keep eye contact with the person. Do not look around the room or seem bored during your interview., Every interview asks standard questions. Listed below are sample questions to expect with sample answers or tips for answering:


Why are you interested at a job with ____? You want to convey to the hiring manager that you will be a good representative. Talk about how much you love the food, the way the company is run, the principals the company stands for, the prices, the work environment. Don't make up stuff if you don't know for sure - don't say you like the money they give to charities if you don't know they do that. Also be honest with things like you need a job for your family, especially if you think the restaurant has better wages than competitors. If the place is open 24 hours and you need a night job, emphasize that. If it is not open 24 hours, talk about how you like that you can be home at night.
How would you deal with problem customers? This should be answered positively. Focus on how you would try to handle the situation to appease the customer, but then say you would hand it over to a manager if you had to. Don't say you'd offer to give the customer free food or a comped meal. The company may not do that, and it may not be within your power to do that.
Why should we hire you? Talk about how you are highly motivated, that you listen and learn quickly, that you are a team player and a friendly individual. You may want to stress that you can handle the physical demands of the job.What would you do if you caught a co-worker stealing food? Make it clear when asked a question like this that you will not cover up when co-workers are breaking rules or breaking the law, but also emphasize that you will hand it over to an authority, like a manager, and be discreet and professional.
What experience do you have in this field? Think about relevance. Highlight things you have done that are relevant to the job you are applying for. A hiring manager will expect you to talk about what you've done at a previous, similar job. If you have no experience in the field, think of skills that are similar - working as a team member, your work ethic, communication, and meeting deadlines. Most fast food jobs also require basic math and reading comprehension skills, along with following safety rules. Talk about your ability to do those things.Are you applying to other jobs? Answer yes, because this shows that you are serious about finding a job. However, make sure that you show preference to the restaurant you are interviewing for. Don't tell the hiring manager at Wendy's that you'd much rather work at Burger King.Try to keep your examples recent. Most employers are interested in recent experience, whether that experience is from a job, school, or volunteer activity. They may ask you questions phrased like ""Tell me about a time when"" or ""Give me an example of when"". Hiring managers want to get a sense of your competency. If you haven't given them enough examples or depth, they may ask you to clarify or give more information., One of the major selling points with a job in fast food is availability. If you can work any time, any day of the week, you set yourself apart from other applicants.Sometimes, the positions the hiring manager is trying to fill are for very specific time slots. If you are unavailable during the times they need, you will not get the job.Don't say you can work a shift you cannot. Make sure you have reliable transportation to get to work when you are scheduled.

, Fast food is an industry that has a lot of employee overturn. One thing they are looking for is employees who will be there longer than a few months. Many companies even promote from within, so demonstrating that you are interested in eventual leadership roles and moving up in the company can make you an appealing applicant.

, During the interview, make sure your answers demonstrate how valuable you will be for the company. You want to be enthusiastic, eager, and open to learning. If you've never worked in fast food, emphasize the things you have done in the past that have prepared you for what will be expected, or show them how eager you are to learn.

Knowing and using a guest's name is an important first step in creating a valuable repeat customer who may request your station when they return, and they usually tip much higher.


This might not be possible on busy shifts. That said, you can still help your guests by having waters ready and at the table, for example, right before they sit down.Checking in quickly to say ""hello"" or ""welcome, as they sit down is a quick, small way to make a connection before the meal begins.;
, If your table orders fries, you might be wise to bring ketchup (these are often called pre-sets or pre-drops). If your table orders messy food, bring extra napkins. Be a great waiter and anticipate their needs, donât make them ask. Keep an eye on the table whenever you pass by, and make a mental note of any pressing needs -- empty water glasses, dropped forks, etc. -- and step in when needed.

, Checking on them verbally every time you visit your section may backfire and become irritating. Your guest will let you know if they need anything when you are walking through. Providing refills, napkins, etc. will ensure that the only thing they should ask you for is the check.


There is a fine line between anticipating needs and annoying your guests. To help, imagine that your guests are always in the middle of a very important conversation. They don't want this conversation to be broken up or interrupted unless completely necessary. Refilling waters quietly, placing silverware, etc. are fine, but stopping them to ask ""if they need anything?"" every 5 minutes will quickly grow old.

, People will have questions, want to make substitutions, and may even want recommendations. When taking orders, stand close to the table, and even consider crouching slightly so that you're nearer to eye-level. In some studies the closer a waiter gets to the table, the higher their tips became.


Ask kids and women for their orders first. This is basic, but most waiters and waitresses miss it. When you follow this basic cultural rule you will be amazed how the tips just seem to roll in.

, Several studies have discovered that you earn more tips if you repeat the order of each guest exactly - not paraphrased. Your guests will then (unconsciously) think that you are similar to them and it will help to make a connection.


This also shows lets them feel like they are being paid attention to, and assures them that they will be taken care.

, This is so basic, but when not done well it can really hurt you financially. If you know they suck those things down, you might consider bringing them two at once. Don't feel the need to ask them for refills: if it gets low, bring another. When the whole table orders water, bringing extra doesn't hurt either., Print their checks after you send the order, desserts, coffees, etc. and place in a check presenter. No guest wants to wait for their server to return with their check so it helps to always have it on the ready. One minute to a server may feel like five to a guest.


Once the check is presented, don't disappear. When people get the check they're ready to leave, so you need to get it processed and finished to move them out the door.

, Instead of bringing your guest a box, offer to do it for them. Some will say no, in which case you may bring a box for them, but this will really be going the extra mile and will help your case when it comes time to tip.


Note: this is illegal in some states. - Make sure you know your employer's policies beforehand.

, You cannot earn your tips alone, and a chef with a grudge could always wait a little longer to cook your food if you've been rude to them. As a result, your table will be left to wait, and they'll likely pay you less in tips as a result.


This is not just for restaurants where the entire staff splits tips. You should always be kind, courteous, and helpful with your staff -- as neither of you would have jobs without the other.

These licenses are granted by state and local governments. You should find your state or local ABC board.


Type âyour stateâ and âABC boardâ or âalcohol licenseâ into a search engine. Your stateâs ABC website probably has links to local boards.
Write down the phone number and email address. You can contact them with questions.;
, In some places, you can only get a liquor license for your establishment if you have lived in the area for a certain amount of time. For example, in Harford County, Maryland, at least one person on the application must have resided in the county for at least a year before applying.


There are probably age requirements as well. For example, Kentucky requires that you be at least 21 before applying for a license to sell liquor., Most states offer a variety of liquor licenses. You should identify the one that best fits your needs. For example, most states probably offer the following:Restaurant license. This license is for establishments that primarily sell food, but sell alcoholic beverages as a secondary product. Alcohol must be consumed on the premises.
On-premises or tavern licenses. Bars that do not primarily sell food can get a tavern license or its equivalent.
Hotel liquor license. Hotels can get this license, which allows them to sell liquor that is consumed on the premises and in hotel rooms.
Club license. This license is for fraternal clubs that has a membership and hold regular meetings.

, If you donât know what license to get, you should contact your ABC board, which should be willing to answer any questions that you have. In Chicago, for example, you can meet with a business consultant., The application process for a liquor license is quite extensive. You will need to provide a lot of information about your business, so you should gather it ahead of time. For example, you will probably need the following information:corporation or LLC paperwork
birth certificate
driverâs license
federal tax identification number
state tax license
lease or deed to the premises
menu
approval of your local governing authority
health permit
other documents

, In some states, you might have to advertise that you want to get a liquor license. In Kentucky, for example, you must run at least one advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation stating that you intend to get a liquor license.Be sure to hold onto a copy of the advertisement, since that serves as proof that you ran it.
The newspaper might also need to complete an affidavit stating when the advertisement ran.

, You can usually get an application directly from your local ABC board, or you can download it from the stateâs website. The application should be quite extensive, and will include forms for background checks.


The application will probably ask for information about your business and the people who will manage the business.Fill out the application as completely as possible. If you have a question, you should contact the ABC board.
Enter your information neatly, using a typewriter if one is available. If the application is in PDF format, then you can usually type your information directly into the form before saving it and printing it off.

, The amount of the application fee should be stated on the application or on other materials that came with the application. The amount will depend on the type of license you are seeking.Remember to include your check with your application.

, Gather all required supporting documents and make a copy of the complete application packet. Then slide all of the application materials in a secure envelope. Mail it to the address provided.


Depending on your state, you might have to submit the application to your local ABC board for approval. The local board will then forward it on to the state agency.
In other states, you will send your application directly to the state.

, Before getting approved for the license, you will probably have to undergo a background check. Depending on your state, you may also have to give fingerprints at the police station.Generally, every owner and officer of the business will have to undergo a background check. If your business is set up as an LLC, then every shareholder may have to undergo a background check.

, Your state might require that you meet with an ABC representative to go over your application or to enter it into the system.You will have to schedule an appointment. Be sure to take your copy of the complete application with you.


Processing times vary depending on the state and the county. You should ask your ABC board for an estimate of when they will make a decision.
As a reminder, you canât sell liquor until you receive your license. You also canât order liquor from a distributor.

, States set certain restrictions on who can get a server permit. If you are the owner of a bar or restaurant, then you should check to make sure your servers qualify before hiring them. Each state will have different requirements, so get a checklist from your ABC board. In Tennessee, for example, all permit applicants must meet the following requirements:Cannot have a felony conviction within the previous four years.
Cannot have a felony conviction related to the sale of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances within the previous eight years. You also cannot have a conviction for embezzlement or a sex-related crime during the same time period.
Cannot have had a server permit revoked in a different jurisdiction within the previous five years.
Cannot have had any ownership interest in any beer license or permit revoked over the past eight years. This includes wholesale or retail licenses.

, Most states require all servers to take an Alcohol Server Education class from an approved vendor in order to get a server permit. Depending on your state, you can take it before or after submitting an application. The following people generally must take the class:managers
owners of the liquor license
bartenders
waiters
designated resident agents for the license

, Your state or local ABC board should have an application to complete. You should fill it out completely and keep a copy for your records. The application may need to be notarized. If so, wait to sign it until you appear before a notary public, which you can find in most large banks or at the courthouse. The ABC board may also have a notary public.


You probably have to pay an application fee, so remember to include that with the application., Many states grant servers a grace period during which they can begin serving before receiving the permit. In Tennessee, for example, servers get a one-time grace period of 61 days. You get this grace period once in your career, not once with each new employer., In case you are audited by an ABC representative, you should keep permits on the premises. If you donât, then your establishment could be found in violation of state rules.As the owner of the establishment, you should get a copy of each serverâs permit. Make sure that your servers have their original card on them during all business hours.

, Permits last only for a certain length of time, which will differ depending on your location. In Tennessee, for example, a serverâs permit lasts five years.You should renew permits before the expire, otherwise you will be serving alcohol illegally.


In New Mexico, you need to re-take an approved class every three years in order to renew your permit.Check your stateâs requirements.

Fall in love with your job.,
Look good and smell nice.,
Introduce yourself.,
Give the customers a little something extra, like a mint or simple drawing.,
Learn to turn tables over.",How to Earn More Tips as a Waiter or Waitress2," When you truly love being a server, it shows. You will become infectious with your good attitude and earn larger tips. People are proven to tip higher when they feel a social connection with their server, as if they could be friends. The best way to cultivate this attitude is to enjoy your work and interactions with others.


A big, open-lipped smile can increase tips up to 140%., Take some time to get presentable before arriving to work. A dirty waiter or waitress is unpleasant to look at and reflects poorly on you and the restaurant. Wash your apron and uniform, and make an effort to wear nice clothes when at work. While attractiveness hasn't been proven to increase tips for male waiters, effort and cleanliness definitely does.


Women should wear a little basic make-up to earn more tips, as a French study showed that 50% more men left tips to waitresses wearing make-up than those wearing none. Unfortunately, more attractive women have been proven to get higher tips than less, but you should exploit this fact for your own benefit as well.The same study found that adding a bit of personality to your outfit, like a flower or button, increased tips by roughly 15%. For women, this is particularly noticeable when wearing something in your hair., In order to build connections with customers, and thus increase your tips, be sure to let the table know your name. When you arrive, say hello and let them know your name before launching into the specials. Waitstaff who introduced themselves earned roughly $2 more per bill.If the table offers you their names, be sure to remember them and use them. The best way to do this is when you get the check. When returning a credit or debit card, be sure to thank the name on the card when handing over the check -- it's been shown to increase tips., When people feel treated or gifted upon, they generally try to ""pay back"" the person being generous to them. Even writing a simple ""Thank You"" on the back of a check was shown to increase tips, and simple smiley faces and pictures help as well.Being kind and generous during the meal can create the same effect. If someone spills something, or an order doesn't come out perfectly, you should offer to rectify the situation for them as best you can.

, This is especially crucial when it is busy or the restaurant is filling up. While you should always be kind and courteous, you want people to eat, pay, and move on so that you can get a new table, and thus a new tip. To do this, come collect the dishes once everyone has finished eating, and ask about further courses (like dessert) instead of waiting for them to ask you."
"
Become a product expert by knowing your menu back to front.,
Sell more food.,
Use ""suggestive selling"" to help your guests make decisions.,
Manicure the table as people eat.",How to Earn More Tips as a Waiter or Waitress3," Notice that when you meet a waiter or waitress that has tried everything on the menu, you tend to listen to their recommendations a lot more. If you want to earn more tips, make a decision to eat everything on the menu and then tell your tables what you enjoyed. They will appreciate it and tip you more.


You should, at a minimum, be able to recommend 3-5 dishes that you've sampled and enjoy. You should also know any common allergens in each dish, as well as basic dietary restrictions (vegetarian or not, gluten-free, etc.)Talk to the chefs about their recipes and food. They can offer you great little bits of information, such as drink pairings and where ingredients come from, that will make you seem all the more knowledgeable.

, When you have higher check totals you get bigger tips. Offer appetizers, drinks and deserts by name. Use enticing and descriptive words like rich, creamy, smooth, spicy, etc. Offer your guest an after dinner espresso or cappuccino. This will warm them up and give them time to think about how great you are and what a giant tip they are going to leave you.


You should always, at the very least, offer your guests dessert and/or coffee.
Be politely assertive about the food, saying ""let me bring you the dessert menu?"" instead of ""would you guys like to consider dessert?, To up-sell, suggest an add on item, like a side of shrimp to accompany a steak or chicken in a salad. Helping a group pair food and wine is a great way to suggest that they get an expensive bottle with their meal.


Be assertive with your suggestions. For example, it might cost extra to get cheese on a hamburger -- but you don't need to explain that. When someone orders a burger, simply ask, ""and you'd like cheese on that?""
This may be less productive for you during busy shifts. Adding $5 to a bill results in a small bump in tips, but getting a whole new group to sit down and spend $55 on dinner will result in higher tips overall., When the beverage napkins get soggy, replace them. When they are finished with dishes, take them away. If they make a mess, politely help them clean it. People feel better in a clean, tidy environment, and are more likely to get more food if they don't see the scraps from their last course.


If a dish is empty, politely ask if you can take it for them. Do not, however, take plates from anyone if someone is still eating. This makes the people still eating feel rushed.
Get rid of small things quietly and efficiently. Try and sweep by and avoid distracting the group from their discussion as much as possible.

These programs provide instruction on the preparation of various dishes using different types of kitchen equipment, safety guidelines, and kitchen management. While these degrees are not required for most positions, many restaurants look kindly on prep and line cook candidates who have both restaurant experience and a culinary arts degree., Some cooks may be able to obtain their jobs by working first as a dishwasher in the kitchen. This job allows workers to become familiar with the kitchen routine and team, and may lead to promotion to a position as a prep and then a line cook. This long-term experience provides a way for experienced restaurant workers to be hired without a degree.While this option will require several years of dedication, it could be less costly. Although you will likely have commit to several years of low-wage work as you slowly rise in the restaurant world, you can also avoid having to pay tuition to obtain a degree.

, Restaurants may advertise their job openings in various forums, so plan to search both online and in person. Start with Indeed.com for online searches. For in-person searches, visit the main dining neighborhoods in your area and talk to chefs about their current openings for prep and/or line cooks.

, Write a one-page resume appropriate for either a prep or a line cook opening. These positions have many overlapping duties, but they do differ slightly.For prep cooks, be sure your resume demonstrates your knowledge of food preparation and various ingredients, proper use of cooking utensils and knives, restocking practices, and general food safety.For line cooks, show that you can produce high-quality food by following the precise instructions of recipes and upper-level chefs. Also demonstrate your ability to use good time-management and multitasking skills while prepping food, assembling dishes, cleaning your station, and operating standard kitchen equipment., Restaurant supervisors will look kindly on candidates who can demonstrate knowledge of the menu and restaurant culture. Theyâll want to know that you can fit into their kitchen, so take some time to read the menu and review any press coverage the restaurant has received. This should impress chefs during any conversations or interviews they conduct with you.Some restaurants, for example, may only cook with locally-sourced food. If you know this going into conversations with your interviewers, you can discuss your commitment to that mission.

, The most important mission of a cook is providing good food to your customers. For every action you perform, remember that itâs all in service of giving a hungry person something enjoyable to eat. This will allow you to treat every task with patience and care., As a prep or line cook, youâll be responsible for keeping the kitchen clean. This is most crucial at the end of shifts, when you should take out the garbage and clean cooking materials and surfaces. You may also need to dispose of unused ingredients and dishes, returning them to their proper stocking locations, donating items, or throwing them away., Food safety violations can lead to unhealthy customers and punitive repercussions for the restaurant. Since youâll be handling food, you should be aware of proper handling, storing, and disposal guidelines. Be sure that youâre also adhering to expected cleaning guidelines.Each state, county, and even individual city or town will likely have unique safety requirements. Ask your chef and supervisors about your restaurantâs specific policies.
Some states may require that one or multiple employees employed by individual restaurants be officially certified by food safety professionals. Your restaurant will make you aware of any necessary certificates you may need to obtain.Proper food safety requires cooks to maintain good personal hygiene as well. You may be required to keep longer hair secured under hair nets or chefâs hats. You should also shower before and after each shift., Prep cooksâ main duties include preparing all materials and ingredients necessary for the restaurantâs dishes. This will likely consist of washing and chopping vegetables, cutting or grinding meat, cleaning fish and other seafood, and weighing and measuring out dry and wet ingredients. Prep cooks will also be expected to organize and store these items so theyâre easily accessible for upper-level chefs., Line cooksâ duties will likely include those of prep cooks, along with the added responsibility of assembling meals. Line cooks will create individual dishes by following the instructions provided by recipes and/or the upper-level chefs. They may be required to work in teams with other line cooks to produce a full menu item., Both prep and line cooks may be required to keep track of their kitchenâs stock. This will include unloading and reviewing deliveries from various food vendors, checking on all pantries and walk-in fridges and freezers, and recording a detailed inventory for upper-level chefs., Prep cooks are paid an average of about $9 per hour, while line cooks make an average of $14 per hour. In larger cities with a more robust restaurant industry, these numbers may be higher. Higher-paying jobs will also be more competitive and may require more experience., Being a cook is a demanding, often physical position. It requires the worker to be on their feet and active for long periods of time. If you eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough rest, your body will be able to handle this high-impact lifestyle without causing you pain., The best way to know how youâre handling your current position is to receive feedback. Your supervisor will likely be happy to provide comments and critiques on your work. Use their advice to constantly reach for a better on-the-job performance. This will show your dedication and may make your supervisors more likely to consider you for promotion., When youâre getting ready to move up to a higher position in the kitchen, watch your fellow workers. Make a mental list of their duties and understand how they approach those tasks. Take special note of when their approaches work well and when they could use improvement.Do this observation on your off-time. Donât abandon your own responsibilities, as this wonât help you on your quest to impress your supervisor and advance your career.

, Make your observation-time more official by creating a set schedule for watching and learning from your co-workers. They will allow you to slowly familiarize yourself with the various tasks they accomplish on a daily or weekly basis. They may then share their duties with you, offering critiques and methods of improvement as you perform those tasks., Your supervisors will be impressed by your dedication to the job and your willingness to take on extra work. Ask the chefs to gear your added duties toward the position to which youâd eventually like to advance. This will allow you to slowly adapt to the new role.Donât take on more duties than you can handle. Your most important goal should be to provide consistently high-quality food to your supervisors and customers.

, It may be easiest to advance up the kitchen ladder at your current place of employment. Your supervisors are familiar with your work, and theyâll know what to expect from you once youâre promoted. However, if all the current upper-level chefs seem happy with their positions and havenât expressed plans to leave, you may need to be willing to wait or to look elsewhere for opportunities., If youâre willing to switch restaurants, you may be able to rise more quickly to higher-level positions. Once you feel youâve gained enough experience at your current position, begin searching for jobs at the next level of the kitchen hierarchy. This may involve relocating to a more restaurant-heavy area, such as a large city.Be sure to remain at your current job long enough to establish a positive relationship with your supervisors. You need good references to get hired at other restaurants. Usually, you should remain at a job for a minimum of about one to two years.

As part of researching, you may need to scout for locations that have huge potential.,
Ask an expert for advice.,

Do you have the ability to take out a loan to finance your investment? Once you have taken care of the capital, you can proceed to number 2.;
, Not because you already have the money or the ability to purchase, you can just go ahead and choose a property to buy. Anyone can invest in a property but not everyone can be profitable.Â  Do your research.

, Sometimes properties can be expensive if they are in a prime location or near the central business districts. But then, the outskirts or suburbs have huge potential too, when the business district gets too crowded, the development expands to the nearest outskirts and suburbs which eventually increases the value of the properties in the area. If your investment is for the long haul this is a good strategy.

, This is where a lot of people fail. They donât ask for assistance or help from an expert who can provide advice and training in the field of property investment. Learn from reputable institutions so that you have the power to make the right decisions and reap the wonderful benefits of your investment.

, Some investment properties take time to increase in value.

, Either way, works but you need to know how to use both means of monetizing your property. For one, while you are paying for the mortgage and cannot sell the property, you can rent it out so it produces income you can use to pay off the debt. And once you are done paying for it, you can sell it at a higher value.

, It's important that all of the projects that you're involved in stay separated and organized because you'll most likely take part in multiple projects simultaneously.

Have top-notch organizational skills.,
Have some knowledge about technology under your belt.,
Be dependable.,
Possess excellent listening skills.,
Take notes on everything.,
Answer the phone politely with a standard greeting such as ""Good Morning, Thank you for calling our company, my name is ___, how may I help you?,
Greet delivery personnel with the same professionalism and politeness as any other visitor.,
Handle customers who come to your business with efficiency and politeness.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Have a greeting ready.,
Be courteous.,
Dress to impress.",How to Be a Good Receptionist," Receptionists are the people that represent the face of the company--they are the ones that clients first speak with them and the people and coworkers go to for information and event planning. Aside from taking calls and directing visitors, they often deal with clients, organize events, set up meetings, etc. With all of these responsibilities, receptionists need to be really organized while dealing with multiple demands at once. A person wonât last long as a receptionist if he or she canât juggle more than one thing at a time and deal with them in an orderly fashion.A great way to stay organized is to invest in a filing system that works best for you. It is important to know what papers and information your boss, your coworkers and your clients may need. Keep all of this information in separate folders--be they on your computer desktop or in hard copy. Organize your filing system in a way that works best for you--if that requires neon sticky notes attached to everything, so be it.
Being organized also means being self-motivated--you donât need anyone else to tell you how to do something, or keep you on track. If you are organized, you will know what tasks you need to complete each day, and what tasks are priorities.
Have phone numbers handy. (lots and lots) i.e. co-workers, employers, contractors, vendors, emergency contact numbers, etc. You will need them all at one point or another. Keep the phone numbers organized on a Rolodex or appropriate computer program.;
, The number one piece of technology receptionists have to deal with is the telephone--and all of the buttons and separate lines that it comes with. Computer skills are also a must--most receptionists have to know how to use email and must be skilled at word processing. It is also helpful to know how to create spreadsheets, and use any industry-specific programs.


Keep in mind that if the copier, scanner, or printer are near your desk, you will mostly likely be depended on to use them (and troubleshoot for coworkers who run into problems while using them.) Once you know the kind of machine being used at your office, brush up on its main functions and the ways to fix common problems.

, A receptionist is counted on to man the desk at all times--it reflects poorly on the company if no one picks up the phone, or there is a line of people waiting to be helped. Make being dependable a priority--if your boss knows that you are reliable and are always there to help, you become indispensable.

, A big part of being a receptionist is listening to people--whether it is on the phone, a question a client is asking, or information being relayed to you. Being able to listen well will make you more efficient--you will be able to solve problems more quickly when you understand what the person is asking the first time around, and youâll connect clients to the person they are trying to reach quickly.

, If a boss asks you to do something, takes notes on the specifics. If a customer calls, make sure to write down their information (name, contact information, what they want, etc.) Notes are a great way to stay organized and remind you of all the little things that come up during the day. Keep your notes in a notepad and have it with you at all times. You will be surprised by how helpful they are, especially when trying to remember what the person who called five hours ago wanted.


Make sure that you write out messages in detail and read over what you have written and most importantly when taking a message, repeat back the message and contact info that you were given so that you can make sure before you hang up that you have the proper information to relay.

, Make sure the phone is answered on the first or second ring. It is not good to keep people on hold for more than one minute. (It's longer than you may think.)


Listen carefully to the name of the person the caller is asking for. Repeat back to caller if necessary. Cell phones often distort sounds. Write the person's name to whom the call is directed if pronunciation is difficult.
Direct the call politely with a standard phrase such as ""One moment please for Mr. Smith."" Or if that individual is on the phone, ""I am sorry, Mr. Smith is on the phone at the moment. Would you like to wait on hold or would you like to leave him a voicemail message?"" Politely thank them and direct the call accordingly.

, You may be required to sign for deliveries. Make sure your signature is legible. Delivery personnel may need directions where to leave packages. Make sure you contact appropriate employees for such matters.

, After the visitors identify who they are and who they are looking for, contact that individual and let her/him know who is there. A standard appropriate phrase is ""Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones from XYZ Corporation is here to see you for his 2 o'clock appointment."" Always get a first and last name and the name of the organization they are from. It is helpful to ask if they have an appointment with Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith will give you instructions about where to have visitor wait and for how long. You can then tell visitor ""Mr. Smith will be with you in a moment."" or ""Mr. Smith said that he is finishing up a meeting and will be with you in 5 minutes. You may have a seat. Thank you.""

, As mentioned above, receptionists are the face of a company--they are who clients deal with first, and the people who answer the questions of people who canât come into the office. No one wants to be greeted by a sour expression and a grumpy attitude. Make it a priority to always have a smile on your face and a cheerful, upbeat personality. Remember to stay patient with challenging customers, even if they get on your last nerve.Even you come up against a challenging client, remind yourself that you are a strong, happy individual. Tell yourself that they are acting out of frustration but know that as long as you are trying your best to accommodate them, you are not the one at fault. It is better to be the one that keeps your head than the one who explodes and looks like an ornery, mean person.

, Its always important to greet your clients in a friendly way. Even if you continue what you are doing before helping them, its important to greet them so that they feel acknowledged and know that you will help them in a moment.


Some greetings are âHi! Welcome to â or âGood morning! If youâll have a seat, I will be with you in just a moment!â

, Be respectful. Treat everyone like they are the most important person that has walked into the office that day. This is your job- nobody cares about how you got stuck in traffic this morning, how you ruined your brand new purse, or even how you lost your favorite CD. Leave personal matters at home. (Even if you don't respect their message or the way they convey it- fake it) Overall, make sure the person is totally relaxed and happy to talk to you.

, You are representing a business, thus you should dress the part. Invest in some business casual clothes. Alternatively, if you are a receptionist at a specific sort of store (such as a clothing store) you may consider dressing the part by buying some of the storeâs clothing and wearing them. Tend to the conservative, unless you work somewhere where fashion, trendiness, or other factors are pushed to the forefront.


Check to see if your business has a specific dress code. Your business may be fine with casual dress, just remember that you should never dress too casually (sweats should be banned from the workplace.)

Determine your boundaries.,
Stick to your boundaries.,
Discuss boundaries with the person you're attracted to.,
Try not to be alone with coworkers you're attracted to.,
Remind yourself of the issues with romances.,
Ask to switch as needed.",How to Avoid Romantic Entanglements at Work1," You've already decided that you don't want to get into a romantic relationship at work. Now, you need to figure out how to actually implement that in specific terms to set boundaries for your and your co-workers.For example, maybe one of your boundaries is to never accept an invitation for socializing outside of work from a member of the sex you're interested in. Once you've established that, you can make it a hard and fast rule. Alternatively, maybe your boundary is to never be alone with a person you feel attracted to.
Discuss boundaries with your partner, if you have one. Sometimes, your boundaries can be determined in part by what your partner is comfortable.;
, Establishing what your boundaries are is only the first step. Next, you need to make sure you follow through with those boundaries. Part of following through is making a boundary clear when it comes up, so people don't get upset or hurt.For instance, if someone invites you out for a drink and you've decided that's one of your boundaries, say, ""I appreciate the invitation, but to keep my work relationships professional, I don't go out alone with colleagues of the opposite sex.""
On the other hand, if it's you just don't want to be alone, invite other coworkers along when someone you're attracted to invites you.

, Sometimes, you just need to acknowledge the elephant in the room. If you spend a good deal of time with one person at work because of traveling and schedules, you may just need to acknowledge that attraction with each other and establish boundaries you're both comfortable with.For instance, you could say, ""I think we've both noticed we have a certain chemistry between us. I hope it's not just one-sided. However, I think we need to lay some ground rules. For example, I have no problem with some flirting, but I wouldn't consider having an affair because I think it would get too complicated. What are your thoughts?""

, Any time you're alone for extended periods with a co-worker who you find attractive, there's the possibility of romantic entanglements. If you have another person around, when possible, that cuts out the possibility of romance to a large degree. Of course, you may not be able to limit this type of interaction, but if you can, that may cut down on your romantic feelings., Workplace romances can be tricky. Anytime you date someone at the office, you're opening up the potential for drama and post-breakup emotional fallout. Consider what would happen if a relationship or fling went south., If you need to, bring a potentially problematic situation up with your boss. If you think something could develop between you and a coworker, you could ask to switch teams or work with other people, if possible.You could say, ""Is it possible for me to work less with John? I just feel like there's a bit too much chemistry there, and I don't feel comfortable working on his team.""

Avoid calling at inconvenient times.,
Call at a variety of times.,
Ask for the best time to call.,
Give the person a specific call back time.,
Make a presumptive appointment in your voicemail message.,
Set aside blocks of time each day for phone calls.,
Consider using the Internet to find out when the other person is at her desk.",How to Avoid Playing Phone Tag at Work1," The start of the work day, just before or just after lunch, or at the end of the day are the times when an office employee is most likely to be away from her desk or have her mind on other things. Give her a chance to settle in after arriving in the office and don't try to catch her as she's trying to wrap up her work and leave., Donât repeatedly call at the same time of day, if you donât get a response. Even if thatâs the time youâve set aside for phone calls, respect the other person, and call at other times during the day., If you leave a message or catch the person on the way out, ask when you can call back at a more convenient time. Youâll be surprised how many people set aside specific times for phone calls each day., Make sure you're at your desk during that time. She is probably as frustrated with playing phone tag as you are. If you demonstrate that you will be available at the specified time, she'll be encouraged to call you at that time., Tell the person you want to contact that you will call back at a specific time. This gives her the opportunity to arrange her schedule so she'll be available when you call back., If youâre not a âphone personâ thatâs okay. Set aside an hour or two each day to take and return phone calls. Be available during this time as often as possible, so your coworkers known when they can reach you. Learn if others are available to talk on the phone at specific times, and contact them during this time., If she's logged into a company-wide instant messaging or phone system, you may be able to tell when sheâs at her desk.

Understand that everyone's time is just as valuable as yours.,
Recognize the stress this bad habit causes you and others.,
Set up a calendar with a programmable reminder on your computer or phone.,
Assess the complexity of a task or meeting in time to complete the task or get the most out of the meeting.,
Break down a task into easily manageable pieces so you don't defeat yourself before you even start.,
Create a work environment where you can be the most productive.,
Reward yourself for not procrastinating, as this will help motivate you to change and improve a bad habit or behavior.",How to Be on Time for Appointments and Stop Procrastinating," Always being late for meetings or appointments is not only annoying to everyone else who has to wait for you or who's attention you're disrupting, but it's disrespectful to those who managed to get there on time or early.;
, Always being the one who is late will not only cause others stress, it could cause a backlash and give you a reputation for being undependable.

, These usually default to remind you 15 minutes prior to the appointment or task scheduled on your calendar. If you have to drive more than a couple miles to an appointment or meeting, set the reminder to go off early enough for you to leave and get to the appointment or meeting on time.


The most important factor in making the reminder work is to put everything down and leave as soon as the reminder goes off. This seems pretty obvious, but if you're a habitual procrastinator, you tend to tell yourself, ""I'll leave that in a minute"" and the next thing you know, 15 more minutes have passed, and you're now late.

, If the appointment is just one you are attending for informational purposes and all you'll need to be prepared is a notepad and pen, then set these items out before you have to leave. However, if you are the facilitator of the meeting or an active participant and you need to prepare handouts or some type of presentation, complete all materials before leaving the office the day before the meeting or appointment. Waiting until the last minute will invariably result in something critical being forgotten.

, Sometimes procrastinating is an almost natural response to something that seems too daunting; instead of tackling it, you complete other smaller, more manageable projects first, pushing the bigger task farther and farther behind.


For instance, if you are preparing for a big meeting or important appointment, don't let the complexity of the meeting hinder your work. Instead, break down the presentation you're preparing into small portions with individual deadlines so it's completed in plenty of time to make it to the appointment or meeting fully prepared.

, This includes making sure you have everything you need to complete your task within arm's reach so you're not having to get up every few minutes to hunt for something.


If you're too easily distracted by the phone, set it to ""Do Not Disturb"" or turn off the ringer for an hour so you can have at least one hour of uninterrupted time.
If you work at home and the TV distracts you, turn it off.
If quiet music helps you relax and focus, program favorite music into your MP3 player or your laptop. (Avoid radios as advertisements, radio announcers and call-in contests can be too distracting.)

, If you previously were the one always running in the door just as a meeting was starting or you're always apologizing to people with whom you have appointments, set a goal of making it to the next five appointments at least 10 minutes before start time. Then when you've accomplished this goal, splurge on something you enjoy as a reward for replacing a bad habit with a good one.

Be on time.,
Be clear mentally.,
Know the schedule.,
Come to meetings with all materials.,
Consider learning shorthand.",How to Be an Efficient and Organized Secretary1," Give yourself plenty of time to commute to the office and get to meetings or other appointments. Be early to give yourself time to prepare or just catch up on emails or other tasks.


Try tracking the time it takes you to get to work every day to see what the true average is, and adjust your timing accordingly. Add a buffer time of 15 or 20 minutes to any given time, and even test out how long it takes to get somewhere in advance of going there for the first time.;
, Get plenty of rest so that your mind stays sharp and thinking efficiently. Have a cup of coffee or tea in the morning if you like, or whenever you need a boost. Take breaks and pause to reorganize your desk periodically.


Get up from your desk or take a break from what youâre doing for 17 minutes after every 52 minutes, as studies show this makes for the best productivity. Do a few simple exercises, talk to coworkers, or just take a stroll around the office during this time., Familiarize yourself with the schedule for your boss, yourself, or any other employees you need to keep track of at the beginning of every day. Glance over the schedule periodically so you can save time when making appointments and avoid double-booking or other errors.


Keep schedules and calendars open and available to pull up on your computer or phone at a momentâs notice so you can consult them and add appointments in right away.

, Show up to any appointment ready with materials and clear notes from previous meetings, and a device or notebook to take down minutes and other notes from the current meeting. Ask your boss about anything regarding your role in the meeting, including any special materials like forms or handouts that you can have ready to save time on preparing or printing later.


Try sending out an agenda for the upcoming meeting, minutes from the last meeting, or any other relevant materials to all the attendees the morning of or night before., Learn about different types of shorthand and ways to speed up your writing if you take a lot of notes by hand.Take a shorthand course to learn the characters and improve your speed.If you donât often take notes by hand or you donât want to learn shorthand, do a typing test. Set a timer for a minute and try typing out a typical email on your phone, tablet, laptop keyboard, and detached keyboard. Then count the number of words you typed on each device. Stick to the device with the highest word count when you need to take quick notes.

Treat everyone the same.,

Skip the flirting.",How to Avoid Romantic Entanglements at Work2," At work, it's your job to get along with everyone. That doesn't mean you have to like everyone, but you should be able to have pleasant conversations with everyone in the office. If you're nice to everyone (and treat everyone equally), you're less likely to encourage individual romances.In fact, if you find yourself attracted to someone, the best approach to take is just to treat them with the same respect you treat everyone else.

, You spend a good deal of time with your colleagues, so it's natural that feelings may develop at times. However, one way to tamp down those feelings is to spend after hours with other friends when you can, as that can help you realize that there other people in the world. You don't have to exclude your work friends, but having other friends outside of work will give you some perspective., You don't have to be absolutely cold to people in the office. However, you also don't have to engage in flirting, where you giggle, touch a person's arm, or lean in when you talk to them, especially if you feel attracted to them. Instead, keep your conversations and interactions professional. In fact, some companies consider outright flirting a fireable offense."

Drop a few hints.,
Be direct.,
Read up on your company's sexual harassment policy.,
Bring the issue to your boss.",How to Avoid Romantic Entanglements at Work3," If someone at work is giving you unwanted attention, you can try to drop a few hints to get them to back down. For instance, if they are always asking you to have drinks or go out for dinner, you can always have another commitment. If they come around to your desk too often, you can say you have too much work to chat. Try to subtly place the emphasis back on work.For instance, if the person comes up to your desk and lingers, you could say, ""I'm sorry. I'm really busy today, and I don't have time to chat.""

, If you've given someone hints that you aren't interested and they haven't taken them, it's time to be direct. Tell them that you are not interested in having a romantic relationship at work, and that you'd like to keep your relationship professional. Also, discuss any behaviors you find inappropriate.For instance, you could say, ""I don't know for sure if this is where you're going, but I'd really like to keep my relationships at work strictly professional. When you ask me out for drinks, I get the feeling you are interested in something more. It has nothing to do with you, but I never pursue romantic relationships at work.""

, If you're getting unwanted attention, it's important to know where your company stands on the issue. Read your company's policy before bringing the issue to a manager, as you'll be able to couch the issue in terms that the company uses., If the unwanted attention continues, it's important that your boss or human resources knows, depending on the company. Your company's sexual harassment policy should tell you who to approach. Bring up the problem you're having, and ask them what they can do to help you.


For example, you could say, ""I've made it clear to John that I'm not interested in him romantically, yet he keeps asking me out. I think that falls under sexual harassment after reading the company's policy. Can you help me deal with this issue?""

Speak slowly and clearly.,
Provide an estimated call time.,
Offer an âagendaâ for the call.,
Tell the person how quickly you need the information.",How to Avoid Playing Phone Tag at Work2," Before leaving a message with an assistant, ask if this is the best way to get in touch. Some people would prefer to touch base with an assistant, but others are more likely to listen to a voicemail. Leave your message using the other personâs preferred method., By including this information in every message, you ensure the other person won't have to look it up before calling you back. State your name and number at least two times in a message. If the person does not know you personally, spell your name, so youâre sure they know whoâs called them., Some voicemails garble messages, and you donât want to miss an opportunity to talk just because your message was misunderstood. Repeat any important information to ensure it is received by the person youâre contacting., If they donât know how long a call will last, people start to dread returning a phone call. Include an estimated call time in your message. Most importantly, stick to it. Donât ask for ten minutes and take an hour. Make sure your estimate is accurate.


Consider saying something like, âI need 10 minutes of your time.â
Ask for an amount of time, âWhen can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss our project?â
Take the other personâs schedule into consideration, âAre you available to set aside thirty minutes to talk about this?â, If there are specific questions or topics you need to answer on the call, email or text these to your coworker in advance. This allows her to feel better prepared for the conversation, and will keep the length of the call brief., Donât assume your coworkers know your deadlines.

Clean up your inbox.,
Be consistent.,
Save paper and time.,
Stock up on supplies.",How to Be an Efficient and Organized Secretary2," Keep a planner, calendar, and to-do list and update them consistently. Keep them in easily seen and reached places, or have multiple that can be synced together.


If you work well with pen and paper, keep a small planner or calendar that can fit in your pocket or purse so you always have it with you. Keep a pen attached if possible so you never have to fish around for one. Have a designated note pad for to-do lists at your desk, and cross things off as you go.
If you work better with digital organization, use your phoneâs calendar and reminder system to make appointments and receive notifications about them. Try apps like Wunderlist or Todoist to manage your tasks., Make sure you always have notes and other materials with you by syncing calendars, lists, and files across all your devices, which nearly every modern app has the capability to do.


Share tasks, documents, and notes with other secretaries, your boss, or other employees with project management software like Basecamp or Trello.Share documents and spreadsheets with Google Docs and use programs like Dropbox or Hightail to send files., Set up a color-coding system to help categorize all of your materials at a glance. Assign a color to each project, day, employee, or any way you want to delineate your work. Use highlighters and colored tabs or labels to mark up files, trays, and notebooks to easily locate the right information.


Many web and mobile apps for email, calendars, and lists also allow you to assign a color to each item.

, Keep your email inbox clean and important information easy to access by filing an email into a folder right away, flagging or marking it as unread if you need to come back to it, or archiving or deleting it if youâre sure you no longer need it.


Try making folders for each year, quarter, or month, or label them by project, employee, or type. Try to respond to, delete, or log the email's information elsewhere right away. Set schedules for yourself, like having all emails filed in appropriate folders by the end of the day, and cleaning out and dealing with everything left in your inbox by the end of the week., Keep materials of the same type in a particular place, and designate notebooks and folders to specific projects. Have a specific notepad for phone memos, for example, that always stays by the phone so you never end up taking down someoneâs name and number on a napkin. Keep meeting notes in a separate place from other notes so information doesnât get mixed up and hard to find later.

, Avoid printing to save paper and opt for online forms or other documents so you can save time and resources. Fill out forms electronically if possible. Scan and save copies of paper files so theyâre always available and donât get damaged or lost. Circulate digital files, reminders, memos, and agendas instead of paper versions whenever possible.

, Never run out of important materials you use to be organized, like notepads, pens, envelopes, and stamps by buying or letting an office manager/purchaser know when you are on your last box or container of something rather than once they are all gone. Order supplies in bulk from a company like Quill to save money and avoid running out so quickly.


Keep supplies organized at your desk or workspace. Use containers, trays, file folders, and other containers that are all labeled or colored for easy sorting.

, Jot down notes on your phone, laptop, or notepad for every meeting, phone message, or other important conversation. Place or move these notes into specifically labeled physical or electronic folders so that you can refer to them later and have records of verbal communication that you may forget in the course of a busy day.

, Practice your greeting and other important or common information you need to say over the phone. Have the list of phone extensions for your office right in front of you and work on committing them to memory so you can transfer calls quickly.


Get to know the special features of your office phone, like sending someone straight to an employeeâs voicemail or adding people into a conference call, so you can save time and avoid technical difficulties.

, Make sure that every form of written communication you send out is spell-checked and free of grammar and punctuation errors. Spend the extra few minutes to read over emails, agendas, and other correspondence to check that everything is correct and save the later time and embarrassment of having to issue corrections or answer emails from confused recipients.


Turn on spell-check in the applications you use for documents, spreadsheets, and emails. Turn on this feature in your browser as well to catch any errors while typing on a webpage, especially when posting to the companyâs website, social media accounts, or other official platforms.

, State your purpose for calling or emailing in as few words as possible. Ask direct questions and repeat your name, company, phone number, and email when needed. Provide a time by which you expect or hope to hear back from them so you can deal with communication efficiently.

, Make sure youâre on the same page and provide reminders by calling or emailing the day before or day-of to confirm appointments and other important engagements.

Know the company policy.,
Turn your ringer off.,
Be quiet.,
Acknowledge other employees.,
Avoid using cell phones in front of clients.,
Keep it workplace appropriate.,
Remember that your phone comes second.",How to Be Courteous With Your Cell Phone at Work,"


Review your employee handbook to familiarize yourself with the guidelines for using your cell phone courteously at work. Some companies have policies allowing employees to use their cell phones on breaks or when there are no clients on the sales floor. Make sure you know the appropriate times to use your cell phone.;
,


Be courteous with your cell phone at work by turning off your ringer when you're working. A ring tone, no matter how quiet or unobtrusive you might think it is, could disrupt the attention and work flow of those around you. Keep it muted or on a mode that allows it to vibrate and get your attention without distracting fellow employees.

,


Use your cell phone courteously at work by keeping private conversations quiet and respectful of other employees and coworkers. Keep your voice quiet and avoid profane language that could offend others around you. If your conversation includes this kind of language, take it outside.

,


Respect other employees if they request that you turn your phone off or take your conversation outside the workplace.

,


Clients could view this as discourteous and feel that you aren't giving them the attention they deserve. This could result in larger repercussions with your supervisors, so refrain from using your cell phone when there are clients or customers present.

,


Remember that you're still at work and keep any conversations or content on your cell phone workplace appropriate. Looking at inappropriate or offensive emails, pictures or videos could violate other workplace policies and get you in trouble, so keep any transmissions on your cell phone professional while you're working.

,


Your cell phone is second in importance to your job. Keep this in mind when you're working and using your cell phone. Never answer your cell phone in the middle of a meeting, when discussing an issue with another employee or when dealing with a client or customer. Do your job first and answer your cell phone when it's appropriate.

Choose a chair with a stable five-point base.,
Choose a chair with armrests that are the right distance apart.,
Choose a chair with adjustable armrests.",How to Adjust an Office Chair," Set up your workstation at the appropriate height. The most desirable situation is if you can change the height of your workstation but few workstations allow for this. If your workstation cannot be adjusted then you will have to adjust the height of your chair.


If your workstation can be adjusted then stand in front of the chair and adjust the height so that the highest point is just below the kneecap. Then adjust your workstation height so that your elbows form a 90-degree angle when you are sitting with your hands resting on the desk top.;
, Sit as close to your desk as is comfortable with your upper arms parallel to your spine. Let your hands rest on the surface of the workstation or your computer keyboard, whichever you will use more often. They should be at a 90-degree angle.


Sit on the chair in front of your workstation as closely as possible and feel under the seat of the chair for the height control. This is usually located on the left side.
If your hands are higher than your elbows then the seat is too low. Raise your body off the seat and press the lever. This will allow the seat to rise. Once it's reached the desired height, let go of the lever to lock it into place.
If the seat is too high, remain seated, press the lever, and let go when the desired height is reached.

, While sitting down with your feet flat on the ground, slide your fingers between your thigh and the edge of the office chair. There should be about a fingerâs width of space between your thigh and the office chair.


If you're very tall and there's more than a finger's width between the chair and your thigh, you'll need to raise your office chair as well as your workstation to achieve the appropriate height.
If it's difficult to slide your fingers under your thigh, you'll need to raise your feet to attain a 90-degree angle at your knees. You can use an adjustable footrest to create a higher surface for your feet to rest on.

, Clench your fist and try to pass it between your office chair and the back of your calf. There should be a fist-sized space (about 5 cm or 2 inches) between your calf and the edge of the chair. This determines whether the depth of the chair is correct.


If it's tight and difficult to fit your fist in the space, your chair is too deep and you'll need to bring the backrest forward. Most ergonomic office chairs allow you to do so by turning a lever below the seat on the right hand side. If you can't adjust the chair's depth, use a low back or lumbar support.
If there is too much space between your calves and the edge of the chair then you can adjust the back backwards. There will usually be a lever below the seat on the right hand side.
It's essential that the depth of your office chair is correct to avoid slumping or slouching while you work. Good lower back support will minimize the strain on your back and is a great precaution against low back injuries.

, While sitting properly on the chair with your feet down and your calves a fist-space away from the edge of the chair move the backrest up or down to fit in the small of your back. This way it will provide the greatest support for your back.


You want to feel firm support over the lumbar curve of your lower back.
There should be a knob on the back of the chair allowing the backrest to move up and down. Since it is easier to lower the backrest than to raise it while sitting, start by raising it all the way up while standing. Then sit in the chair and adjust the backrest down until it fits in the small of your back.
Not all chairs will allow you to adjust the height of the backrest.

, The backrest should be at an angle that supports you while sitting in your preferred posture. You should not have to lean back to feel it nor lean farther forward that you like to sit.


There will be a knob locking the backrest angle in place on the back of the chair. Unlock the backrest angle and lean forwards and backwards while looking at your monitor. Once you reach the angle that feels right lock the backrest into place.
Not all chairs will allow you to adjust the angle of the backrest.

, The armrests should just barely touch your elbows when resting your hands on the desk top or computer keyboard. If they are too high then they will force you to position your arms awkwardly. Your arms should be able to swing freely.


Resting your arms on the armrests while typing will inhibit normal arm movement and cause extra strain on your fingers and supporting structures.
Some chairs will require a screwdriver to adjust the armrests while others will have a knob that can be used to adjust the height of the armrests. Check on the lower portion of your armrests.
Adjustable armrests are not available on all chairs.
If your armrests are too high and cannot be adjusted then you should remove the armrests from the chair to prevent them from causing pain to your shoulders and fingers., Your eyes should be level with the computer screen that you are working on. Assess this by sitting on the chair, closing your eyes, pointing your head directly forward and slowly opening them. You should be looking at the center of the computer screen and be able to read everything on it without straining your neck or moving your eyes up or down.


If you have to move your eyes down to reach the computer screen then you can place something underneath it to raise its level. For example, you could slide a box under a monitor to raise it to the proper height.
If you have to move your eyes up to reach the computer screen then you should try to find a way to lower the screen so that it is directly ahead of you., Most chairs are made to fit around 90 percent of people but those on the ends of the spectrum may not fit. Since there is no âaverageâ person chairs are made in sizes that can be fully adjustable so that they can be made to fit most people. However, if you are very tall or very short then you may need a custom-made chair.


Unless you get a custom-made chair, you should get a fully adjustable chair so that you can adjust it properly for your body., Choosing a chair with controls that are easy to operate while sitting will allow you to adjust your chair completely to your body. You can put yourself in the chair and then adjust all the pieces directly onto your body.

, Height is a very important factor when adjusting a chair so it is very important that the height of the chair can be adjusted according to your body and needs. Tilt is also important for allowing correct posture while sitting.

, The curve along the edge will provide more space for your knees and comfort on the backs of your thighs. Additionally, the seat should not put pressure on the back of thighs or knees.

, You donât want to get all sweaty while working at your desk nor do you want to slide around too much so these factors are important when choosing a chair.

, Adjusting the backrest to completely support your lower back will allow your to remain pain and injury free.

, The base should be a five-point system that provides balance and stability while sitting on the chair. The base should be on casters or wheels depending on your preferences.

, You should be able to easily get in and out of the chair but the armrests should be as close as possible while sitting. The closer your elbows stay to your body while sitting, the more comfortable you will be.

, Armrests should never hamper your movement while working or typing. Adjustable armrests will allow you to customize their height for your body size and arm length.

Go through all locations you may have paperwork and place them all in one pile. Spend time to make sure you can properly account for all active and inactive work you have.


Plan ahead of time by clearing a table space to work on your papers.
If you are adapting someone elseâs paperwork into a new filing system, remove all documents from the current system. It will be better for you to handle all documents and prepare for a new system.;
, This is the hard part of the process, but it is also a crucial step to becoming organized. It may seem tedious, but go through each document in your pile to determine what youâre working with.


You donât need to read each paper, but a brief skim will help you out.
Post-it notes are good for marking important papers you know youâll need to spend time on., As you start to sort through your paperwork, it would be helpful to keep related papers together. You could place all papers relating to the âNickelbackâ client in one pile. Another example is to pile your work based on months.


Having a sense of chronological order could be useful for your filing needs.
Set priorities while sorting through paperwork. When you see papers that are exceptionally important, place them on the top of their respective pile.

, Another pile you can create is the trash pile. You arenât required to throw away a pile of your paperwork, but you should separate the unimportant papers from the other piles. You could even set up a miscellaneous pile where random papers could go.


If you are 100% sure that you donât need some paperwork and you cannot draw a viable link to other document, discard them. Check with your superiors if youâre allowed to throw away anything before following through with something., Keep things simple for yourself by using cheap manila folders. This wonât hurt your funds and will allow you to carry out any filing system youâd like. You can get a pack of manila folders from any office supply store.

, Use the piles you established earlier to act as a guide for your folders. Ensure that the contents of each folder are organized as well. You can either organize a fileâs contents based on each paperâs importance or by chronology.


Avoid arranging a fileâs contents based off the alphabet. Alphabetical organization works more efficiently for organizing groups of files.
Place the manila folders into a filing cabinet as you fill the folders."

Gain experience by working in the wine or fine restaurant industry.,
Combine practical experience with formal and informal wine education.,
Achieve certification.,
Advance to the highest levels of wine wisdom.",How to Become a Wine Sommelier,"


No matter how much formal training or education youâll get, itâs important for a sommelier to have hands-on experience working with wine. You might be able to start right where you are. Entry level jobs for aspiring sommeliers include wait staff, wine retailer, winery tasting room employee or wine import clerk.
Use your experience to develop your understanding of customersâ palates, leading wine producers and the practical aspects of the wine trade. A sommelier needs to have real-world knowledge of both the front-of-house (helping diners choose and taste wines) and back-of-house (building a wine list, working with retailers and winemakers) aspects of the job.;
,


While you are working your way up, take advantage of opportunities to learn everything you can about wine. Read industry publications, annual wine guides, blogs and connoisseur magazines. Attend wine tastings. Join wine trade associations. Improve your own palate by sampling various combinations of wines and foods.
Universities and community colleges, especially in large urban areas or wine growing regions, often offer extension courses in wine appreciation. These can add to your sommelier skills without the substantial investment of time and money that certification and advanced wine education programs require.

,


No certification is legally required for sommeliers, and you may be able to get a job in a mid-range restaurant or private club on the basis of experience, self-teaching and a good palate alone. However, becoming a certified sommelier will increase your chances of being hired by a higher quality restaurant, thereby increasing your earning power and respect in the wine world.
Sommelier certification programs are available in many locations and take a variety of forms. Most take several months, cost thousands of dollars and combine study, writing and exams that become more rigorous at higher degrees of certification.
The Society of Wine Educators, The Culinary Institute of America, The Sommelier Society of America, and Boston Universityâs Elizabeth Bishop Wine Resource Center are among many institutions that provide sommelier certification programs.

,


The highest degree of wine education is provided by 2 organizations that award advanced titles after several years of thorough, costly study. These programs graduate very few students each year, but sommeliers who have achieved these coveted rankings can generally be assured of securing the highest level of employment and respect in the wine community.
The Court of Master Sommeliers awards a Master Sommelier (MS) degree, which is internationally recognized as the authoritative credential for buying and serving wine. Passage of all 4 stages, each of which culminates in exams, is required to earn the Master Sommelier ranking. Only a little over 100 people worldwide have attained this standing.
The Institute of Masters of Wine offers seminars in the U.S., Europe and Australia. The self-paced program takes 3 years or more; a residential option shortens the process to 2 years. There are about 250 people worldwide who have earned the title Master of Wine.

Use an alphabetical filing system.,
Use a topical order.,
Try numerical filing.,
Use color coding.,
Use a frequency system.",How to Arrange a Paper Filing System2," An alphabetical filing system works well when you need to retrieve names of people, customers, authors, names of movies, books, or etc. Provided you use terms that are easy to retrieve, an alphabetical filing system is often the easiest system to use.The best way to file and retrieve files is by labeling each file. Manila folders have an extra tab designed to label files that will make your retrieval process easier.
If you are handling clients, it is more efficient to alphabetize by last name.
If you have a lot of files, consider making letter sections to help you organize. Section dividers are large and simply contain one letter. You can also divide the letters in pairs like âA-Dâ or âF-K.â

, When you work or study in a variety of subject areas, a subject or topic order can be a very useful way to retrieve information. For example, if you study law, you could have subject headings of contract, constitutional law, torts, administrative law, international law etc.


The best way to organize topical information is through section dividers. Label your section dividers based off the contents, like âAdmin Law.â
This system works best if you have several different topics. If you not, youâll be left with one or two dividers and not much of an organized system.

, This type of filing system is ideal for files that contain dates or numbers. For example, if you have invoices, receipts, dated events etc., the numerical system can make an easy system to locate again. You can also consider month and year labeling for this option. For those working in an environment that uses numbering for papers such as medical files, legislative documents, court cases, etc., numbering is a useful retrieval method.


Only use this system if you are comfortable viewing several numbers and can retrieve information from these numbers.
Mark on the filing tabs the numbers or dates and organize based off the numbered value. Start with â1â and have the following numbers increase value.
If you are filing with months, start with January and move, in order, through December. Youâll benefit with section dividers for each month.

, This is great for creative filing and is especially effective for those with good visual recall. It can help to cross-reference different subjects based off color coding. You can color code any of the aforementioned techniques for filing.You can also use a combination of organizing systems by pairing color codes with another system.


One of easiest ways to add color to your established filling method is by using highlighters. You can purchase a variety pack of highlighters from any office supplies store.
Another way to implement color coding is by using a variety of colored folders.

, This works well for items that you use all the time, but shouldnât be a standalone system. It needs to feed off another system, for example the alphabetical system. Add the frequently used information to a grouped space in your filing area so that it can be retrieved quickly, such as at the very front of a filing cabinet drawer.Youâll need to be careful you donât get unorganized using this system. Keeping the project youâre currently working on in the front, wonât always guarantee an efficient organization.

File paperwork immediately.,
Keep your space updated.,
Clean out your space.",How to Arrange a Paper Filing System3," One way to ensure your filing system runs efficiently is by filing paper as you process it.The filing system is not going to work if you put off filing papers. Getting into the habit of filing papers will also help your productivity and workflow.

, Every couple of months you should go through your filing system and do a brief sweep. You arenât required to review all your papers like you did for the initial organization. Check through all files and make sure everything is organized and in the right place.


After the first few months you could also reflect if the system you choose is working for you.

, Once a year you should do a larger cleaning of your workspace. You might have some files that you regularly use, but you should now go through the other files you use less.Open the files you use less and read through all your documents to see if there is any unnecessary paperwork.


Take out all the files and wipe down the filing cabinet with a damp washcloth to remove dust buildup.

Create a recipe that fits certain criteria.,
Research key components in your recipe.,
Write your recipe.,
Practice making the dish using the recipe.",How to Become a Recipe Developer2," When you work for a company or publication, they may assign you a broader idea for an article. For instance, they may want you to create four distinct dishes for the holiday of Kwanzaa. This challenges you to create unique and distinct dishes and tests your skills as a recipe developer.


When you aren't working for a company, a great way to get inspired is to impose these criteria upon yourself. You may come up with some interesting results.

, Do your research on the ingredients and components within your recipe and determine things like how they taste and the most common methods to cook them. This knowledge will give you a better understanding of how to use these ingredients in a plethora of dishes. Research may also reveal commonalities in other recipes which enable you to deviate from the norm.For example, different apples have different textures and some, like Granny Smith and Fuji apples, are better for baking than others., Write down a recipe based on the research that you did and your experience. Estimate when writing down quantities of each ingredient. While it seems counter-intuitive to write the recipe down before you cook it, it will give you an outline to work off of after you cook your meal.

, Follow the steps and quantity of ingredients based off the recipe that you wrote. If you know that a step is out of order or that a quantity of an ingredient isn't right, adjust the recipe and alter it to your knowledge. Critically assess the recipe and make adjustments. This may be easier if you have other people who can also taste your food.Take note of whether your spice quantities are accurate and examine your recipe's cooking times. Alter your recipe based on your experiences during practice.


When choosing people to cook for, make sure that they enjoy the selected cuisine.
Change and alter your recipe based on suggestions and comments made by those tasting the food.

Experiment with different ingredients.,
Do your research and read recipes online and in cookbooks.,
Go out to eat often.,
Network with other recipe developers, cooks, and chefs.",How to Become a Recipe Developer3," Get a family member or friend to cook the recipe that you wrote. This will give you a good idea if your instructions are easy to understand, flow, and are intuitive. It's important that during this time you don't give any tips or input on what they should do next because your recipe needs to stand on its own.Having a novice try your recipe will give you an idea if it's easy to execute for those with little kitchen experience.
A professional or another recipe developer could give you advice or tips on how to improve your recipe.

, It's important that you expand your horizons and cook with different methods, regional ingredients, and handle food that you're not used to using. Experimenting with different ingredients will give you knowledge over different types of cuisine and will help you develop more authentic recipes.


For example, if you usually cook Mediterranean cuisine then consider going out of your comfort zone and start cooking with Asian ingredients like soy sauce and curry paste., Reading the work of other recipe developers may give you insight on how to improve your recipe development skills. It may also help you develop your own style when writing recipes. Find widely distributed or popular cookbooks, and determine what makes them popular. Integrate these tactics into your own recipes to improve the quality of your writing.


If you are unfamiliar with a certain cuisine, taking a culinary class for that specific type of food may help you hone your skills., Cooking is important, but so is trying different cuisine. Eating your own food may have you missing out on spices or flavors that you don't typically implement in your own recipes. Eating out at culturally different restaurants can inspire you and motivate you to create completely different recipes. Try to mix up the types of food you are eating to get more information on what you can create.

, Talking to other people in your industry may make you aware of potential job opportunities as well as give you insight into the methodology of other recipe developers. Become friends with people in the industry who can help you expand your boundaries and become a better developer.

Instead, most ads prioritize that you should be at least 18 years of age and have the ""ability to maintain attractive and fit image.""You might find you will become more competitive for a job if you gain experience in a restaurant or cafe taking orders, working a cash register, and contributing to a large team. Although this is not strictly necessary in all locations, popular Hooters locations will consider experience in a competitive hiring environment.;
, You can find job postings on the ""Careers"" section of the Hooters website (www.hooters.com), but many Hooters Girls report being able to walk into the restaurant and fill out an application after you inquire for one.Because the value of the Hooters Girl is, according to the company handbook, based on her ideal appearance as an ""All-American Cheerleader, Surfer Girl, Girl Next Door,"" you should present yourself in a way that embodies at least one of these three types.Dress professionally, but in a way that also flatters your body. Consider wearing a pair of skinny, dark jeans with tall boots and a blouse, a flattering pencil skirt or even a body hugging dress in a dark color (like black or navy) when you go inside to ask about employment. Your potential manager will note your appearance.Hooters generally does not employ men on their serving staff, although they have faced multiple law suits over this practice. In 1997, they won a class-action lawsuit against male plaintiffs under the reasoning that hiring an all-female waitstaff was a ""bona fide occupational qualification"" for its business (meaning the core value of its business would change if it began to hire male servers)., , If the Hooters restaurant is in immediate need of hiring, you could be interviewed after you fill out your application. But you might also be called in to interview at a later date. Wear a similar outfit to what you wore when you inquired about an application.


Emphasize your perpetually cheerful disposition. Most job ads for Hooters Girls state that they must be ""fun, upbeat, and entertaining.""Smile constantly during your interview and do not talk negatively about your past work experiences or complain about former bosses. Talk about your people skills and how you make conversation with strangers.
You will probably be asked questions about your past work experiences, how you approach customer service, how you handle stressful situations or work in a team, your schedule and availability, etc.

, If you are offered a position, you will need to sign the Acknowledgment form, which states that you understand that Hooters' work environment is ""one in which joking and innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace.""You must also state that you do not find your ""job duties, uniform requirements or work environment to be offensive, intimidating, hostile or unwelcome."", According to the Hooters Employee Handbook, your tank top must be tucked into your shorts at all times. Do not reveal your midriff. You must wear a white or nude bra and it can't be visible to customers.You also must wear pantyhose under your shorts and they must be in the shade Suntan. If your skin is a darker shade than Suntan, you can select a darker shade. You are not allowed to wear a lighter shade of pantyhose than Suntan.For footwear, you must wear white ""slouch"" socks and all white sneakers. The sneakers cannot be in any other color than white and they should be a ""high top"" style.If you have any tattoos, they cannot be visible while you are wearing your uniform.
You are not allowed to wear the Hooters uniform anywhere outside of Hooters. It should not be visible when you are outside the restaurant.You should also be prepared to pay for extra elements of the uniform (tank tops, shorts, panty hose, etc.) You will be provided one uniform but then you are required to buy any extras pieces should your uniform become dirty or frayed., The Hooters Handbook strictly prohibits wearing a ponytail or pigtails, hats or headbands. Hair is supposed to be done in a ""glamorous"" style, which suggests worn down and long with full volume.Consider putting your hair in large rollers for one hour after drying as this will give you added volume and pretty waves.
You should also try back combing the roots of your hair, brushing it out, and then spraying it with hairspray to add extra volume.

, Make up is also a required component of your appearance while at Hooters. It must be, according to the handbook, ""camera ready at all times.""Basic components of your beauty routine should include foundation (to even out skin tone and cover any redness), concealer (to cover blemishes and under-eye circles), lipstick, mascara and eyeshadow. Your makeup should be wholesome, yet sexy. For lips, stick to colors like pink, coral and rose tones. Avoid dark wine or plum lip shades.
For eyeshadow, consider more neutral tones of brown and gray. Do not try anything too dramatic (like a bright blue or purple) or overwhelming (like a 60s eye flick or a very smoky eye). ""All-American"" means pretty and sexy, yet still natural.
You are encouraged to think of yourself not simply as a waitress, but rather as a model who has been ""cast"" to play the glamorous guide through your customer's pantheon of Hooters-rooted fantasies., Hooters encourages minimal jewelry; its handbook limits it to one necklace, two rings per hand and two earrings per ear. Chokers and tongue piercings are prohibited., For Hooters Girls, nails must be clean and pretty, done in French manicure or nude color. If you wear false nails, make sure they look clean and get them re-done when they start to chip or break off.You are not allowed to wear nail polish in the following colors: black, gold, silver, purple, blue, green, yellow. Avoid anything that suggests you might have slightly eccentric tastes., Always show up for your shift on time and be prepared to help out your co-workers when scheduling conflicts arise. Most women who work as Hooters Girls have lots of other responsibilities, from working through college to raising families.Try to keep your schedule flexible. If you have periods where you can take on extra shifts -- like during a school break -- then try to help other co-workers who might have other demands on their time.

, At breastaurants, 75% of customers are men, most of whom are middle-aged. Unlike other chain restaurants, Hooters encourages waitresses to have a personal rapport with their customers. Make conversation with them and give them personalized attention.Be very friendly, positive, and engaging. Do not complain, make offensive jokes or use profanity.
Do not touch your customers. Most restaurants stipulate you can only touch customers when putting a hand around their waist in a picture., This is what Hooters calls its ""hands off"" approach. If your customers order a pitcher of beer, pour it for them individually. Open every container for them. Your job is to make sure they can simply relax and eat., Hooters emphasizes that its servers must be ""fit,"" meaning not overweight or obese, or could face termination. You will probably have to exercise at least three times a week in order to maintain the body type of a Hooters Girl.Consider walking, running, swimming, cycling or hiking for at least 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week.

, Although chain restaurants (like The Olive Garden and Applebee's) have generally struggled to attract customers since the recession, breastaurants like Hooters (and similar places like Twin Peaks and The Tilted Kilt) have actually grown since 2008. Many waitresses also report getting larger tips at breastaurants than at other franchises., Although you might make larger tips at Hooters, studies have shown it can take a psychological toll on its employees. In some studies, Hooters Girls have reported experiencing lewd comments, groping, harassment and even stalking in extreme cases.The result is that many waitresses working in breastaurants have reported experiencing feelings of depression, anxiety, anger, and a sense of degradation. They often feel constant pressure to maintain the beauty standards set by their company.If you start to feel this way while working, turn to your support system of co-workers, friends and family members. Many servers have discussed bonding with their fellow Hooters Girls over these kinds of issues."

Be sure to read the requirements for your chosen place, as many cities will require you to have taken some food safety courses.


If you want to start your own business, you will most likely need a physical shop as well. This means you will have to follow health and building codes. You will also need a small business license.If you want to run an at-home catering service, you will need two kitchens: your home kitchen and your work kitchen. You will also need a food service operating license.Lastly, you will need to be able to manage waiters, drivers, cleaners, and so forth.;
, You will have to know how to deal with staff not showing up, picky and rude clients, and food getting burnt or ruined. You will need a few backup plans at all times, so being creative and knowing how to improvise is a must. If you do not handle stressful situations like these well, your business will falter.

, Many caterers also have to take part in coming up with the decorations, especially for themed parties. For this reason, taking a few business and marketing classes might be a good idea.

, Most states and countries will require caterers to have some sort of license, which will allow them to work legally. The license you get will depend on where you live, and what sort of catering job you want.

, If you want to start a catering business, you can build a client base by catering for your family, friends, and neighbors. Be sure to ask them to give you good, but honest, feedback about your performance. Also, ask them to keep some of your business cards so that they can give them away to potential clients.

, This will allow you to train and perfect your skills while getting the qualifications you need. Many internships are unpaid, but they give you valuable experience and references. Some internships might also end with a job offer.

, Not all food can be made at the event, and certain items, such as cakes and pastries, need to be prepared beforehand. A restaurant or bakery will allow you to do this. It will also help you get more customers. Anyone who eats at your restaurant may decide to use your catering service at his or her next event.

, You won't get to choose your menu; you will have to use the restaurant's food instead. You won't be your own boss, but you also won't have to run an entire business. Lastly, you won't need to cook as much since the food will be provided by the restaurant. If you enjoy doing events but the idea of making food stresses you, this may work for you.

, Treat everyone equally and always be polite, even if they are rude to you. Greet your clients and guests with a friendly smile. An unfriendly attitude may lose you clients, even if your food is perfect.

, Create an account on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Pintrest and post photos of your dishes. Post a few photos of your business at various events so that your clients can see how you do things like decorations.

, Post your menu, prices, and lots of clear photos. The website should be neat and well organized. Be sure to include your email and phone number. The more ways people have of reaching you, the better.


Try adding pictures of your business at events. This will show people how popular you are.

, They may seem old-fashioned, but they are small and easy to carry. The next time you cater an event, bring a stack of business cards with you. One of the guests might just need a caterer at his or her next event!

, If you are late, your client will lose faith in you and might leave a bad review of your business. Also, make sure that you have everything you need before going to the event. This will prevent any last minute runs to the store and keep things running smoothly.


If you are running late, be sure to call your client and let them know. Apologize and offer a discount. Even if it is not your fault, the thoughtful offer will display good customer service. It may also make your client feel better.

, Just don't take away anything that is popular and well-liked. This way, if the new dish does not work out, people will have something familiar and well-recommended to fall back on.


Consider doing seasonal specials. Keep a year-round menu, but include a few items that are only available during the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer.

This is the individual who is ultimately capable of advancing or stalling your career. Once you figure out what your bosses' chain of command is and who has the final word on work-related matters, you'll be able to figure out how to prioritize your workflow and know whose decisions can override everyone else's.Ask specific questions about how your management team is structured. Find out who reports to whom and follow that chain to the top.
You may also be able to determine the chain of command at your company by looking at which manager has seniority and/or wields the most power in the workplace.
Work hard to please all of your bosses, but put the most time and effort into appeasing your ""ultimate boss."";
, Some bosses prefer regular check-ins, while others step back and trust you to work on your own and get the job done on time. Which style works best for you is a matter of preference, but you may need to adjust to a management style you're not used to in order to appease one or more of your bosses.You should get a sense of how much your boss micromanages based on how they communicate with you.
If you're not clear what your boss's management style is, try asking them. Say something like, ""I want to make sure I'm keeping you adequately up to date without overloading you with my check-ins. What type of system would work best for you?""

, It may go without saying, but a big part of navigating your management chain will entail knowing what's expected of you from each of your bosses at any given time. If one of your bosses doesn't make it clear what they want from you, you can find out by talking to that boss.Initiate an informal conversation about your collective objectives. For example, you might say something like, ""Hey, when you get a chance, could we sit down and talk about what direction we should be moving this project in?""
Set realistic goals and objectives with your bosses. Don't set the bar too high, but don't downplay your abilities by setting the bar too low, either.

, If one or more of your bosses likes to micromanage your work, it may eventually reach a point where your ability to work becomes impeded by their interruptions. If this happens, you may need to establish certain boundaries with your boss. However, you'll need to do this carefully and tactfully to avoid conflict in the workplace. Coming across as insubordinate or argumentative could cost you your job.Politely and professionally ask your boss if you can speak with them about your current project. Emphasize how important the project is to you, and how much you want to support your company's vision.
Never pin the blame on your boss or accuse them of doing anything wrong. Frame the conversation around how you work best as an employee and what you need from your boss.
Let your boss know if you need more or less management, but do so professionally.
For example, you might say something like, ""I respect and appreciate your position and everything you've done. I just think it might be easier for me to meet your expectations if I had a little more responsibility on this project.""
By setting your boundaries and establishing a better dynamic on one specific project, it will be much easier to transfer those boundaries and dynamics to other projects in the future.
Focus on addressing how you respond to your boss's management style in one situation rather than ""critiquing"" your boss and their leadership abilities.

, Some bosses want face-to-face meetings while others want email updates. Still others take a more hands-off approach to management. Your boss may want to micromanage your work at every step, or they may trust you to get your work done on time by yourself. Figure out how each boss prefers to communicate and delegate work to smooth out the reporting process.Ask each boss how they prefer to communicate and with what regularity. Then check in with them as often as you have to.
You should also assess what communication method each boss prefers. For example, if your boss only wants an email update or phone conference once a month, asking for weekly face-to-face meetings will feel like a waste of their time.
Report problems early. There is no reason for a boss to be blindsided because a problem has spiraled out of control. Don't try to minimize difficulty or impact. Instead, ask for suggestions to fix the problem, and don't make it worse by refusing to accept direction.

, Your boss should know what you're working on at any given time. That includes work from that boss and work assigned by your other managers. Ideally, none of your bosses will make unreasonable demands if they know what's on your plate for each manager.Never complain to any of your bosses about your workload from them or anyone else. Simply keep your boss in the loop by saying something like, ""I just wanted to give you a heads up that next week I'll be working on _____ reports for _____.""
Try keeping an electronic calendar with all of your deadlines, meetings, and work progress updated in one place. That way you can simply share your calendar with all of your bosses.You can also mention what you're working on or what projects are coming up when you check in with each boss. Keep them all in the loop on what you're working on and for whom.

, The best way to manage reporting to multiple bosses would be to include them all in a conversation with one another. If your bosses are amenable to it, getting everyone together for a joint meeting could help smooth out your chain of command and the order of operations for your work.Let each boss know that a group meeting would make it easier for you to perform optimally for each manager.
When you ask your bosses, be polite and professional. Say something like, ""I know you're very busy, but I think it would really help streamline the workflow and maximize communication if we had a group meeting with all of my other bosses.""
Having your bosses communicate with one another, either informally or through regular meetings, could also help make it clearer what your obligations are to your other bosses at any given time.
Don't attempt to resolve conflicts between your bosses, as it may look like you are choosing sides. Explain the differences in priority and let them resolve any conflicts that arise.

, If you're reporting to multiple bosses, you may feel confused at times about what's expected of you and by whom. Clarifying your roles and responsibilities, both with each boss and for your own understanding, can help take some of the stress off of working under multiple managers.Sit down and calculate who in your department should be doing what work, then determine what percentage of that workload should fall on your plate.
Write out what you believe are your primary functions in the office and compare these to the expected role that your company established in their hiring guidelines (the role or roles you were told you'd be filling when you were hired/promoted).
When you clarify your roles with your managers, bring a written list of each role/responsibility and ask each boss if they agree with that assessment.
Say something like, ""Would you agree that these are my roles/responsibilities? If not, can you clarify what I should be doing differently?"" Then keep a copy of those roles/obligations at your desk in case you ever feel unsure of what you should be doing.

, For many workers, it can be difficult not to internalize work-related problems. Under the stress of your job and the chaos of reporting to multiple bosses, you may begin to feel that everything that goes wrong is your fault. It can be helpful to remember in those situations that workplace problems are most likely a result of circumstances rather than anything you're doing wrong.Step back and ask yourself whether you actually did anything wrong. Would any of your colleagues have done things any differently, or was the situation unavoidable?
Find ways to disengage from work at the end of the day. Do something relaxing and rewarding, like going for a walk, riding your bike, or spending time with family and friends.

, If one of your bosses is particularly hard on you or just generally difficult to work for, you may be experiencing a lot of stress. In situations like this, the best course of action is to be open and communicative with your boss.Be proactive by initiating conversations with your boss. You can ask about both professional and personal matters (if you deem it appropriate to do so).
Try to get to know your boss a little and find some shared interests or things you have in common. This can help your boss see you as more of a relatable person.
Once you've established some type of rapport, you can casually let your boss know how much you value your job and the company you work for.
You may also want to ask your boss for suggestions on how to improve your professional relationship/collaboration. Say something like, ""I feel like things are going well, but I just wanted to check in and see if there's anything you'd prefer I did differently.""

, While reporting to multiple bosses can be stressful, it can also be potentially advantageous to you. You can use your chain of command to advance your own career and get professional favors from time to time as needed.Find ways to make allies with as many of your bosses as you can. You can do this in subtle ways by getting to know your bosses, doing small favors for them, and establishing a good professional rapport with them.
Spend more time and energy getting to know the boss or bosses whose position most closely aligns with your career goals. For example, if you want to focus on accounting, get to know the manager who can advance your accounting career.
If you have a work-related request and one of your managers said no, discretely ask other managers until someone says yes.
Once you figure out who is most likely to accommodate your requests, you can make that manager your go-to person to ask for favors.

Document how you will follow up.",How to Present Bad Work Related News to Your Supervisor," You may be tempted to hold off on delivering the bad news because you don't want to be blamed for the bad news, even when it's not your fault. However, delaying will often make the problem worse.For one, if your boss finds out that you didn't tell them, they're going to be even more unhappy. Also, if your boss has the bad news, they'll be able to prepare for the consequences instead of being blindsided by them, which means the company's reaction as a whole can be more positive.Any problems with significant consequences should be reported as quickly as possible.
Assess the potential impact of a problem to determine when to report it. Any issue that may result in danger or law suits, such as major violations of company policy, should be reported immediately.
The sooner you get the information to your boss, the sooner they can take it to their boss, if they're not the head of the company.;
, If the bad news is not urgent, keep your eyes open to see when your boss seems less busy. When you notice their workflow slowing down a bit, go in and ask if you can talk to them. That way, you give them a chance to push it off to another time if they don't have the time right now.However, an important issue, such as sexual harassment, should be reported immediately, regardless of how busy your boss is.


For less pressing news, you could pick a time when you know the person will be in a good mood, as then the bad news won't come as such a blow.For instance, you could say, ""I have something I'd like to discuss with you. Is now a good time?"" Also mention about how long you think it will take.
You definitely don't want to catch your boss as they're trying to get out the door or running downstairs for lunch.
You could also send an email asking about a good time if that's more your boss's style., Trying to soften the blow with rhetoric is not going to help. Just get to the point. Your boss is busy, and most busy people prefer directness, as it takes less time and they don't have to guess at what you mean. Therefore, have a concise statement to open the conversation with.For example, you could use a statement like, ""I have some problems with the new line."" Phrasing the statement that way reflects ownership and the acceptance of responsibility. If you blame others, you may be viewed as a whistle-blower or company rat.
On the other hand, if you know your boss likes small talk, it can help soften the blow to chat a bit first., Your tone sets the mood. If you treat the problem as something that can be fixed and you remain positive, your boss will likely see it that way, too. However, if you're all doom and gloom and come in with a depressed posture, your boss is going to pick up on that, too.Make sure you stand up straight, look your boss in the eye, and speak in a clear tone of voice. That shows you have the confidence to solve the problem.

, Expand on what you think the problem is and how you think it will affect the company. You can also explain how it could affect your work or other coworkers. Be sure to offer specific, detailed information, but also try to keep it concise. A long paragraph should be enough to provide detail on most problems, at least at this stage.Be as objective and specific as possible in the description of the problems.
For example, don't say, ""The new line isn't going over well with our test groups.""
Instead, be specific by saying something like, ""80 percent of users we tested find the product useful, but almost all of those said they didn't like its appearance.""

, Whether it's your screw up or a systematic problem, you need to be able to talk about why you are bringing bad news to the boss. Make sure you have all the information you need to explain what's going on and how it happened. If you can pinpoint the exact point that something went wrong, that's even better.To know why, you're going to need to do some investigating beforehand. Gather all the information you can on the situation and talk to any relevant employees about the situation.
Be sure to separate speculation from fact when asked for information. However, speculation is ok as long as it is identified as such.

, If possible, leave blame out of your explanation. Good leaders and managers always assume the blame for a production or project failure, even though a subordinate might be responsible. The only time an employee's name should arise in a conversation with a superior is to give credit or when an employee breaks company policy.

, Your boss may find the news upsetting, and if that's the case, give them a chance to let it out. Venting frustration can be helpful, and it gives them a chance to figure out what to do next. However, don't take anything your boss says personally. It's often not about you.Letting your boss vent about the problem is not the same as letting them scream at you. That is, if you feel like your boss is taking their anger out on you, such as screaming obscenities, you can say something like, ""I see this problem is upsetting you, but I'd appreciate it if we could discuss this matter more calmly. I can come back later if I need to.""

, You should be calm when presenting the news, but you should also stay calm even if your boss starts getting mad. If you start getting angry and upset, you're only going to escalate the situation, and then both of you are going to be more stressed out. You don't want to stress out your boss more. That's a recipe for disaster.If you feel yourself getting angry, pause to take a few deep breaths and calm yourself. Remind yourself that you need to stay calm no matter what.

, Of course, you don't necessarily need to have fixed the problem, though it can be good if you have. However, having an idea of how the problem could be fixed or even a couple of ways you could go about fixing it can help smooth the waters.For example, once you present the bad news, you could say, ""Now here's what I think we can do to fix this issue. I think we need to hold off production and go back to the drawing board on style. I also think we need to bring in some new people on design.""
If you don't have a solution yet, let your boss know you are working on one (and follow through).
Good employees recognize problems that are within their responsibility to solve and which are not.
For example, if the the impact of the problem extends to external parties of the work group (other departments, customers, legal), most superiors want know as soon as possible to minimize complications and conflict.

, It's not enough to just have a solution. You also need to be able to discuss what the solution will cost the company, both in terms of supplies and company time. Also talk about why you think the solution will be effective and how it could change the problem for the better.Focus on providing objectivity, clearness, and completeness when describing your solution and how it will resolve problem.
You could present it this way: ""I think bringing in new people will help shake up the style department, which in turn can help marry our traditional styles with something more innovative. While halting production will cost the company about $200,000, I think that it's the best option for producing a line that the public will embrace. Plus, we now have the feedback from the study groups to take back to design.""

, Even if the solution will cost the company money, it's important to discuss how the company will benefit from it. Focus on those benefits when you're presenting your solution to your boss, as they'll want to hear what the bottom line is in how the company can come out on top.For instance, you could say, ""In the end, I think revamping the style for our new line will benefit the company greatly. The product is rock solid, and the focus groups responded well to the functionality. In fact, many commented on how well it worked, despite the fact that they didn't like the look of it. By taking the proper time to focus on the style, we'll be putting out a product that's well in line with our brand image and that will be appealing to customers both for its functionality and beauty.""

, You don't want to absolutely fall over yourself with apologies. However, if you're to blame in the situation, you can apologize to your boss for the part you played. Just make sure to keep your apology short, professional, and to the point.Be cautious with apologies. Errors are learning tools, and it's better to express what you have learned from the instance and can apply in the future.
Most problems arise from a combination of circumstances, not because of one person's failure. Consequently, there is no need to accept blame where it is not deserved.

, Following the meeting, be sure that your superior agrees with you about the steps that need to be taken. This is true whether the steps are your idea or theirs. Get at least a verbal confirmation that they agree with the proposed solution. If required by company policy, have them sign off on your solution., Talk to your boss about any ideas or feedback they have on the situation. Once you've come to a decision or at least a way to move forward, make sure you tell your boss how you will proceed.For example, you could say, ""I'll write up what we've discussed in an action plan and send it to you an email by the end of the day. Then I'll contact the necessary people to get the ball rolling. I'll follow up again in the week to let you know the progress we've made.""

Look ahead, not backward.",How to Prepare for a Performance Review As an Employee," Whether youâve just started a new job or have been in the same position for a while now, start a journal for work. Detail your experiences on the job to use as reference for your next review. Keep an accurate record of both your high and low points. Refer to these so your supervisor doesnât overlook any points where you exceeded expectations, and so youâre not caught off-guard by any unexpected criticisms. Keep track of things like:Both positive and negative feedback from coworkers and/or customers.
Dates, times, and circumstances surrounding specific instances.
Emails, paperwork, and other reference materials to be cited.;
, If your next performance review is in the next few days or weeks, then starting a journal now will really only benefit later reviews. If this is the case, cast your mind back and try to remember as much as you can about the timeframe to be discussed. If needed, ask coworkers for refreshers if certain details escape you. Focus on things like:Projects that you successfully completed.
Missteps that lowered your productivity.
Improvements that youâve made over that time period.

, If youâve already received a performance review from the same employer, go over what was discussed, with a particular eye on any areas that your supervisor felt you should improve on. Reflect on how you have done just that (or still need to). Whenever possible, find measurable data to back up those claims. Available data will depend on your exact job and the issues raised in your previous review, but it could be in the form of things like:


Positive increases in recorded sales, order fulfillment, or completed projects.
Favorable decreases in missed work hours, disputes with coworkers, or disciplinary incidents.

, First, if your supervisor provided you with a written description of your positionâs duties, save it. Use their own words to identify exactly what is expected of you as an employee. From there, identify how youâve met or failed those expectations, as well as how you may have exceeded them. Depending on the exact nature of your job, assemble any additional material that you can cite directly as further proof of your productivity. This could include:Customer ratings or reviews and/or similar material from outside sources.
Daily, weekly, monthly, and/or quarterly reports.
Project status reports.

, Use your journal or summary to create a concise list of your successes throughout the time period in question. Keep it short and to the point so it will sound impressive without verging into prolonged bragging. Include not only what you did, but a brief description of how you did it, too. For example:Say youâre listing âreduced overheadâ as an accomplishment. Detail this further with short explanations like ârenegotiated bids with supply vendorsâ or âswitched to new materials that are equally effective but significantly lower in cost.â

, Obviously, landing a major client that drastically increases your companyâs revenue looks pretty good on a list of accomplishments. However, donât neglect the small steps you have taken to improve your performance. Use minor things to highlight your attention to detail. For example:Reorganizing your physical workspace to make materials easier and quicker to access may have only shaved five minutes off what used to be a 30-minute project. But if your job is highly repetitive and you extend the math over an eight-hour workday, thatâs over a half-hour of saved work-time.

, Keep in mind that your employer is most likely more interested in having an efficient team for a workforce, rather than a collection of individuals who compete against each other for favor. As you compile your list of highlights, give credit where credit is due. Demonstrate your team spirit by sharing the spotlight when others deserve it.At the same time, donât shy away from emphasizing your role in each success. So if that big impressive project that you were part of was a major success in large part because you personally reached out and improved communication between various departments, say so.

, In addition to your highlights, list those aspects of your job and work environment that have been particularly challenging for you. Also make special note of exceptional shortfalls in your performance and detail the specific circumstances that led to them. In both cases, come up with your own solutions. Demonstrate your ability to analyze your own performance with objectivity, as well as your personal desire to improve.For example, letâs say you run the shipping department for an online retailer and have suffered delays in shipments.
If this is a recurring issue, think of how restructuring your procedure, reorganizing your workspace, and/or adding more full-time staff could help.
If however you got slammed due to unique circumstances (like a three-week holiday season between Black Friday and Christmas, instead of the usual four), consider what steps you can take the next time around in preparation.

, The length of time that your review is supposed to cover may vary from one company to the next, or even by department. At the start of your meeting, confirm with your supervisor the exact period to be discussed. Ensure that your performance over the entire period will be evaluated, rather than just the recent past.This is important because memory tends to skew toward more recent events. This means your supervisor may overlook particular highlights from earlier in the period, and/or fail to appreciate your rate of improvement over the entire timeframe.

, Keep in mind that everyone has areas in which they could improve. Resist the urge to grow defensive. Regardless of how you rate yourself as an employee, anticipate some amount of negative feedback from your supervisor. Begin your meeting with a humble mindset.This is why preparing a list of your own shortcomings beforehand is important. This way, youâre less likely to be caught off guard by specific criticisms, and thus less likely to take them personally.

, When your supervisor criticizes your performance, own up to it. Avoid using your co-workers as scapegoats. Be aware that this will only add another valid criticism to your performance (âdoes not accept responsibilityâ).Of course, if you are being unjustly criticized for a situation that was genuinely created by others, stand up for yourself.
At the same time, show your willingness to improve by offering ways that you could personally help in minimizing such situations (if possible), such as by improving communication or sharing resources.

, Assume that your supervisorâs intention is to help you improve, not merely reprimand you. Donât be afraid to ask for specific forms of help if you think you would benefit from them. Obviously, what to ask for depends entirely on your position as well as the company as a whole, but things to ask for could include extra training, additional resources, and/or the removal or restructuring of company policies or procedures that prevent you from succeeding.This doesnât have to be solely in response to your supervisorâs comments. If you believe such help will benefit you, suggest it even if they donât raise the topic themselves.

, Obviously, as a review, your discussion will begin with past events. However, as the conversation continues, shift the focus forward. Instead of getting caught up in a point-by-point response to things that are already over and done with, concentrate on the future. Leave your supervisor with the impression that youâve digested their comments and are already thinking of ways to apply them as you move forward.Donât save the future-talk for the end, either. As your supervisor brings up concerns about past performance on a point-by-point basis, address each point by emphasizing the lessons that youâve learned from past experience and how you intend to use those in the future.

Take a deep breath.,
Keep your mouth shut.,
Give your boss some time and space.,
Talk about it again later, as appropriate, without making it a ""big deal"".,
Learn from the experience.",How to Recover after a Bad Conversation with Your Boss,"Â While admittedly you may have played things differently given a second chance at the same conversation, itâs unlikely that one bad interaction will ruin your career. And the reality is that this actually could be a great opportunity to show your boss how you handle yourself in a tough spot. This probably wonât be the last time something doesnât go as planned and proving your ability to be mature and keep a level head is a fantastic trait that every manager appreciates and rewards.;
,Â Your first inclination may be to run to a friend at work to replay the incident; however, this is probably the worst career move you could make. Your reputation at work should always be your number one priority and as soon as you share the details of a private conversation with your boss, your failure to communicate has the chance to become public. While âyour bestie at the officeâ may never share it to hurt you intentionally, they may vent to others in an effort to support you. But the last thing you need is for your boss to hear the sordid details around the office.

,Â As much as you might want to run right back to your boss and talk things out, time is your friend. This is especially important if you plan to apologize for the way you handled the situation. Apologies should be heartfelt and will appear much more sincere if youâve taken the sanctuary of a little time and space before giving one. Additionally, your boss is busy. If the conversation was a train wreck, chances are good that it already took more time from their day than was planned or warranted. Respect their time and schedule until you find a more appropriate time to continue the discussion.

, This step depends a lot on your relationship with your boss. If the conversation was relatively minor and you think it's best to just move on, skip this step.


If you guys are on particularly friendly terms, you may just be able to casually mention, ""Oh hey, sorry about the conversation earlier. I wasn't as prepared as I'd like to have been, and went down the wrong track. If you want to talk about it again, let me know; I'll be sure to have my thoughts more clear by then.""
If you have a more formal relationship, you may consider approaching it formally as an apology, in a moment when they have some free time. However, this does risk making a bigger deal of the event; if you think your boss will have forgotten about it shortly anyway, just move on, learn from the conversation, and do better next time.

,Â Bosses understand that mistakes happen and a good one will admit that they have made their own. But they also expect top performers to learn from their mistakes. Think through the conversation again and try to figure out where things went wrong. Did you say something that caused a reaction from your boss that led to the end result? Or perhaps you didnât fully understand what was being said and decided to wing it. Regardless, learn from your mistake and vow not to make the same one again.

Thank your boss.",How to Organize an Unorganized Boss1," Express your concerns in list form. This will help you focus your concerns, and it will iron out your frustrations so that you do not take them out on your boss. If you are anxious about meeting with your boss, you may also want to rehearse what you say to them beforehand.;
, Whether your manager prefers to discuss routine tasks with email, in person during meetings or on the phone, learn to utilize their favorite method. Furthermore, you should observe how formal or informal they are when they communicate with you and match that style.

, When you approach your boss, state how you are working and how you feel. Avoid using âyouâ phrases such as âyou should be doing betterâ or âyou need to ___â These sound accusing and can threaten your relationship with your boss. Instead of saying âNobody around here plans anything. Everything is so unorganized. You should be better at giving us information,â trying stating âI am struggling with scheduling in this office. I feel as though we do not organize effectively. Is there anything I can do to help improve communication?â

, A disorganized boss may give conflicting advice or cumbersome tasks. If you are confused about what you need to do, politely ask for clarification. It is best to ask as you receive the tasks. Phrase your questions in a positive light so that it doesnât seem like you are complaining. Instead of saying âwhy do we have so many meetings when we donât do anything important?â try stating it this way: âSince weâre all so busy with our work, is there any way we can have fewer but more productive meetings?â
You can also use âIâ statements while asking. Try saying, âI was wondering which task has the highest priority for this week.â

, If you have a problem, come to your boss with a few solutions already in mind. You can let your boss decide which solution will work best, but by preparing ahead of time, you are making it easy for your boss to respond to the issue.


Start the conversation by telling your boss you have both a problem and some potential solutions. Be sure to tell them at the beginning that you want their thoughts on the matter. You can say, âI just wanted to bring an issue to your attention. I have a few possible solutions for the matter, and I wanted to run them by you.â
If your boss rejects your solutions, try asking what you can do instead to solve the problem. You can say, âWhat do you think is the best way we can handle this situation?â

, When your boss does manage to give you something on time or help you, thank them. Even bosses want appreciation and praise. By showing your gratitude, not only will you increase your rapport but you will encourage your boss to continue such behavior. "

, Ask your boss if you can discuss the week's priorities on a regular basis. By having a consistent time every week that you enforce, your boss will begin to conform to a schedule. Choose a good meeting date that works for both of you. During the meeting, create weekly goals and confirm task assignments. Review your mutual accomplishments a week later.

, If you need a meeting or some information from your boss, give them plenty of time to respond. If you do not receive a response in a timely fashion, a gentle reminder will help motivate an answer. By giving them plenty of time, you will increase your chances of a response. , Just as you should communicate with your boss, you should be working with your coworkers as well.

Streamline paperwork.,
Keep a schedule.,
Practice good email etiquette.,
Delegate tasks.",How to Organize an Unorganized Boss3," If you want your boss to read certain documentation, create a top sheet summary of short, concise bullet points explaining the most important ideas contained in the document. Provide your boss with a general understanding of the handout to save time for more important projects that require direct collaboration.

, Create your own schedules for project dates and deadlines. Ask your boss if your project management ideas coincide with project expectations. If the schedules work, then you will have given your boss a pre-prepared agenda to follow, boosting their productivity. If they do not, you may have to make minor changes, but you will at least have a calendar to lessen the disorganization around the office.

, If you email your boss, the subject line should clearly state the intent or contents of the email. If you are sending them an attachment, write a brief summary in the body of the email about what the attachment is. This will make it easier for your boss to find the email later, and it will decrease the amount of time they spend searching for your communications. A good subject line should be no longer than 8 words long. You can indicate if you want a response. It should be specific. Example: âAbout Our Wednesday Meetingâ; âPlans for ____ Project. No Response Neededâ; âIncreasing Our Traffic. Thoughts?â Do not use phrases in the subject line like âhelloâ or âhow are you,â and avoid using all caps. , Donât try to handle the organization of the office on your own. Work with your team and delegate tasks to those who are best equipped to handle them. This will spread the work out amongst your coworkers and ease the burden on your boss. "

Ask for more responsibility.",How to Impress Your Boss With Your Presentation," In order to give an effective presentation, you need to consider your audience. Are you presenting in front of a group of students or before the top management of your company? Students would appreciate a fun presentation but you will most likely need to keep your presentation for your bosses more formal.This can affect many aspects of your presentation â from the kind of music you choose to the type of clothes you wear.
A more formal presentation in front of your boss or other executives from your company would require formal business attire (suit for men, business suit or nice dress for women) and more formal sounding music accompaniment (like elevator music), while a presentation in front of students might warrant more casual attire (slacks and button-up shirt for men, slacks and a nice top for women) and even allow for more contemporary/fun music along with your presentation.;
, The context in which youâre giving the presentation is something to consider as well. If your presentation occurs during a big business conference, this might be a more formal affair than a presentation in a conference room at your office. Consider what adjustments you might need to make based on the context of the event.Consider the venue. As it relates to the tips above, a formal setting (like a conference room or auditorium) will require a formal presentation whereas a presentation given more casually in your bossâs office might require fewer formalities., Is it a report on the different kinds of personalities for your psych class? Are you doing a product presentation to top management in your company? Are you giving your boss a status update on a new project? Once you know the topic of your presentation, it will be easier to visualize the sound or music you want to play in the background.

, Good organization reflects well on you in more ways than one. Not only does it show your boss that you are capable of handling pieces of information and crafting them into a cohesive presentation that is valuable to others, it also shows that you are more dependable and capable than some other less-organized employees.Have your presentation flow in a logical and informative way. Have your notes lined up with you visuals â using clear cues for yourself so you donât get mixed up.

, Visuals always help a presentation look more polished and professional. They allow the audience members to have something more concrete to hold on to during your presentation rather than just trying to connect to abstract words.Put all of the data into a spreadsheet and make copies for everyone at the meeting. Or create a PowerPoint slide show to go along with your presentation.
An effective PowerPoint presentation includes high quality visual images instead of cheesy clip-art, works to limit the amount of text that appears on each slide, and presents data in a logical sequence that is easy to follow along with., A work presentation is an occasion to dress up more formally, even if the place you work at allows more casual attire. You are representing yourself and how you want others to view you and your outfit will be one of the first things they notice. Set the tone early with impressive attire.For men, wear slacks, a suit jacket, and a tie. For women, wear a nice dress or a business suit.
And remember that you are representing your company, by extension, when you are presenting â so you want to dress accordingly.

, Your boss will not be impressed if you sound like a meek, scared person during your presentation. You should project the image of a confident person, someone who knows what they are talking about and whose opinions should be valued.This means that you should use confident body language like not crossing your arms, making eye contact, and standing up straight.
You can try practicing at home ahead of time and asking a friend to tell you if they think you are speaking with confidence.
If you make a mistake, just keep going. You can correct yourself, but donât draw more attention to your mistake by dwelling on it or by being obviously embarrassed. Everyone makes mistakes, but the way you recover from yours will be what your boss remembers the most.

, Make sure you are being as informative as possible in as brief a time as possible. Giving a great presentation is all about providing clear information in small, easily digestible quantities. Make sure you donât go off on tangents. Stick to the topic at hand throughout the presentation.


Speak with a steady pace. Talking quickly can be perceived as a sign of nervousness, so slow your words down during your presentation. If you speak too quickly, you may stumble over your words more frequently as well, so make a conscious effort to slow it down.
It may also be harder for your audience to grasp and digest the ideas youâre discussing if you say everything too quickly.

, Make sure you know your material inside and out. When giving a presentation, you are the expert, so you need to be the most informed person about the topic. You should be able to answer any questions people have and be able to explain the complex ideas within the presentation topic clearly.


Try to think ahead to what questions people might have about the topic â maybe what questions you had when you first started working on the project â and explain it to your audience from that perspective.
Try saying things like, âThis may seem like an overwhelming amount of information, but Iâll walk you through it.â Or, âLet me take you through the process step-by-step.â

, Show your boss that you really know your stuff and that youâre able to think on your feet during the Q and A portion of your presentation. These skills will really impress your boss and show him or her that you are more than competent.If someone asks a question you donât know the answer to, give a positive response about how you are going to look into that further â something like, âWhat a great suggestion. I havenât fully developed that aspect of the project yet, but I will absolutely consider this as I move forward.â

, Once the presentation is over, try to schedule a follow-up meeting with your boss as soon as possible. You want to get the meeting in while your presentation is still fresh on your bossâs mind so that they can give you honest feedback, but also so theyâll remember what a stellar job you did.


This kind of follow through after the presentation will impress your boss with your dedication to the work and doing a good job for the company.

, A presentation is a great opportunity for you to be less formally evaluated by others at your place of employment. Ask your boss or fellow colleagues to give you some honest feedback about your presentation and the work you perform on a daily basis. This will impress your boss because it will show that you are open to feedback and willing to adapt in changing environments.


Take the feedback to heart and implement any helpful changes that you might receive as constructive criticism.

, Once you have shown your boss that you know what you are talking about, ask him or her for some more responsibility within your current role. This is a great way to impress your boss. Asking for more responsibility at work without demanding a corresponding raise shows that you are committed to the job.


Try saying something like, âI would really love to continue growing and developing my role within the company. If you are open to it, I would like to take on some additional responsibilities around the office.â

Decide how important the issue is.,
Focus on the company benefits.,
Look for any gaps in information.,
Think about timing.,
Write down your thoughts.",How to Kindly Tell Your Boss That He or She Is Mistaken1," Telling your boss they're wrong can have an impact on your relationship. Therefore, you want to make sure the issue is worth discussing before bringing it up. If your boss is wrong over something minor, alerting them to this may come off as condescending.How much is the issue really affecting your work life? If you disagree with your boss on something minor, such as policies regarding lunch breaks, it's probably only a minor inconvenience for you and other employers. This may be a difference to simply accept.
In general, if a concern is impacting the efficiency and performance of you and other employees, it's worth addressing. Individual concerns and pet peeves are generally not a large concern for your boss. Remember, they're focused on what's best for the company and not a single individual.;
, When planning what to say, keep the big picture in mind. Think about why your boss's misjudgment adversely impacts the company. When speaking to your boss, this is where you want to place your primary focus.Think about how your boss's decisions are impacting fellow employees and overall output and productivity. If other employees have expressed frustration to you, keep these concerns in mind.
For example, your boss may adhere to an older computer system because they believe it's more efficient. However, the older computers clearly run slower than newer models, and you believe some of the leftover budget money should go towards this purchase. Your boss, however, has decided to put the money elsewhere.
In this situation, look at some objective facts. You can present your boss with information about why newer models run faster. You can show your boss how much more work will get done in a single day when using newer, faster computers.

, If your boss is incorrect about something, you may know something they do not. In this case, it's perfectly acceptable to fill your boss in on what they may not know. Consider if there are any areas of the company where your boss is less involved.For example, your job may be to oversee enrollment for after school programs in your company. Enrollment has skyrocketed this year, and you believe it is necessary to hire a temp for data entry work. Consider whether your boss knows about the spike in enrollment.
If your boss is involved in other aspects of organizing after school programs, they may not realize the necessity of a temp. You can fill your boss in on how much enrollment has increased, and how much extra data entry will be required.

, When you address the issue is important. It's a good idea to let your boss choose the time. This way, your boss can pick a time where they're free. This can also show you still respect your boss's authority, even in times of disagreement.Approach your boss and say something like, ""I have something I wanted to go over with you. Can you let me know when you have a spare 10 minutes? I'll need your full attention, so I wanted to make sure I caught you when you're free.""
Ask to reschedule if necessary. If your boss seems distracted during your set meeting time, say something like, ""Hey, you seem really busy today and I don't want to distract you. I'm fine rescheduling to a time that works better for you.""

, It can be stressful to confront your boss. You may stumble over your words during the talk, so writing them out ahead of time can help. While you shouldn't read off a paper when talking to your boss, jotting your words down can help you better commit them to memory prior to the talk.Write down your major areas of concern, as well as how you want to address them.
Review your words to make sure you're making yourself clear and behaving in a professional manner. Rewrite as necessary to keep your language professional.
Review what you wrote down right before the meeting. When the meeting arrives, try to stick to your script.

Listen more than you speak.,
Do not be afraid to ask questions.,
Ask your boss for feedback.,
Determine what is important to the boss.",How to Impress Your Much Older Boss1," Because you are younger, your boss may make some assumptions about you. Your boss may think that you are less mature, inexperienced, and less knowledgeable. Speaking less will prevent you from saying something reckless and proving your boss right..


Choose your words wisely and only speak when you need to. Avoid talking just to talk.
You will also learn a lot by observing and listening to your boss and coworkers.;
, Your boss does not expect you to know everything. Asking questions demonstrates that you are humble and are willing to learn.It is more damaging to get something wrong because you did not ask instead of asking a question and then producing quality work.


Try to figure out as much as you can on your own before approaching a coworker for advice or help. This way you can ask intelligent questions and show that you have tried to problem solve on your own.
When you receive an answer, listen and try to apply it to your work. Tell your boss, âThank you for your insight. It was really helpful.â

, After you have been working for a few weeks, ask your boss for feedback about your performance. This shows your boss that you are thorough and take pride in your work. The feedback will also help you perform better at work and understand your bossâs expectations. Some questions you should ask include:Iâve been here for a few weeks. How do you think things are going?
Are there any areas that need improvement?
Is there anything that I should be focusing on?
What are your expectations for the first month? 6 months out?

, You can learn about your boss by observing or by asking direct questions. Pay attention to how your boss prefers to communicate and how your boss interacts with other employees. Most supervisors have particular things that are very important to them such as neatness, tardiness etc. Find out what is important to your boss and do what counts.For example, if you notice that your boss prefers emails over in-person interactions, use email as your primary method of communication.

Determine if the coworker is hypercompetitive.,

Decide the next steps.,
Speak in a professional tone.",How to Help Your Boss See How a Coworker Is Undermining Others," Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between someone who is hypercompetitive and someone who is sabotaging others at work. The two are not mutually exclusive.


Someone who is hypercompetitive tries to beat out everyone, however someone who is actively undermining others wants to see coworkers fail. They usually do not care about the outcome of the project. Rather, they care more about how they will look in the end, no matter the outcome.Watch for a tendency to steal credit for your work or to blame you for their shortcomings. These are also signs of a coworker who is trying to undermine you.;
, Does the questionable coworker gossip a lot, and spread hateful rumors about other coworkers? Are they quick to criticize, but never offer any solutions? Have you or your other coworkers been bullied by the coworker? For example, a coworker is a bully if they make fun of other people, blame others for problems, and tattle-tell frequently.If you answered yes to these questions, then chances are you are dealing with an undermining coworker.

, How your coworker relates to others shows a lot about their motivations. Are they cooperative or demanding? Do they champion successes by everyone or do they only focus on their achievements? If someone is struggling, are they likely to offer support or criticism? These questions can help you determine if the person is self-serving., Has the questionable coworker taken credit for your or otherâs work and/or ideas? If you and your coworkers worked as a team to complete a big project and the questionable coworker took most of the credit for its completion, without contributing much, then they are taking unnecessary credit for your work.


Save all emails where you have contributed original ideas and work., Often times, undermining coworkers will overstep their boundaries. They will act as if they are superior to your and your coworkers, even if you are all equals. Or, perhaps they tell your coworkers to report to them instead of you.Also, if the coworker is trying to take away your team members, or misguide them, be suspicious about this coworkerâs intentions.

, Another tell-tale sign that a coworker is undermining you or others is if they purposely forget to invite you to a big meeting, donât include you in important e-mails, or âforgetâ to pass along important messages from your boss. This coworker might be actively trying to leave you out, in order to make you look incompetent, distracted, or like you donât care about your job duties.


This is especially an issue if there is an upcoming promotion or an empty spot above you two. Think about possible motivations that your coworker could have to keep things from you.
If you think your coworker is hiding something, make sure that you are getting the information from others so that you can properly do your job.

, Before confronting your boss about the issue, talk with other coworkers. Try to see if they are running into the same kind of issues with the questionable coworker. This will help you determine if the undermining is directed at you, or if it is a general issue among other coworkers. However, it is highly likely that your coworkers are experiencing similar issues.


Ask your coworker, âDoes James forget to include you in important emails?â Or, âJames told me something really negative about you the other day, does he say negative things about me, as well?â

, When confronted with the problem of an undermining coworker, you can help your situation by keeping a log of the issue. For example, write down important conversations and events that illustrate your argument. Include the time, date, and names of others who were present.


For example, try to write down verbatim what the questionable coworker said and did or did not do. If your coworkers were present during an event or conversation, write a summary of what happened and have them sign and date the document as proof of what actually occurred., Try to keep the problem transparent by ccing your boss on all email communication between you and that coworker. For example, if the coworker did not provide you with important information for you to complete a project, ask for the information by email and cc your boss.If the coworker keeps âforgettingâ to inform you about important meetings, send an email to all the people in the meeting. Include the information and ideas you would have provided at the meeting, and ask them to invite you in the future. Again cc your boss in the email.
Form a professional relationship with others in the office who have access to the information you need so that you have other ways of finding out what you need to know.

, When you confront your boss, they will most likely ask what you have done to resolve the issue. Therefore, try to confront the coworker beforehand about the issue.Try to resolve the issue with the coworker first, but make sure that you don't have a confrontational attitude. Instead, be direct and respectful.


You can say, for example, âHi, James. I just wanted to know why you didnât tell me about the meeting this morning.â
See how they respond. If they avoid the issue by saying they âforgotâ, but it has been a repeated problem, then you can tell your boss you tried to resolve the issue. Document this, as well.

, Before confronting your boss, try strengthening your relationship with your boss by scheduling regular meetings with them to discuss your performance. This will enable you to get closer to your boss, and they will see that you genuinely care about your job, and want the best for the company.


How regularly you meet with your boss depends on your bossâ schedule, but try to meet with your boss at least twice a month.

, When confronting your boss with the issue, pick a convenient time to talk. Donât address them when they are in between meetings or important phone calls.Email your boss and ask them when it is convenient for them to talk. Be positive in your email and donât go into too much detail.

, When meeting with your boss, have your documents and what you will say prepared beforehand. Keep things logical and in order, focusing on the person's negative behaviors and not on them as a person. This will prevent you from unleashing a long and emotional rant about your coworker, which can reduce your credibility.Write a small statement of five to seven sentences that succinctly states the problem, what you have done to address the problem, and how the problem has impacted your and other coworkerâs work.
Remember to stick to the facts when discussing the issue. Make copies of your documents and keep the originals. Give the copied documents to your boss to have on file. Keep your own file, as well.

, If you want to add credibility, bring another coworker to the meeting. An ally will show your boss that this is not just a personal issue between you two, and that others are being affected by your coworker's behavior. Your argument will be much more persuasive if another coworker is supporting what you have seen, heard, and said.If you decide to bring a coworker, let the boss know beforehand that the coworker will be coming with you to the meeting.

, Once you have discussed the issue with your boss, discuss what to do next. Ask for you bossâ advice on how to move forward with handling the issue. Will your boss talk with the other coworker about the issue, or will you try to handle it yourself and report the outcome to your boss later? Or, will job responsibilities, evaluations, or reporting relationships be changed? Make sure you and your boss come to an agreement about what will happen next.If your boss suggests a solution you have already tried, like confronting the coworker, respectfully remind your boss that you tried this, and that the outcome was not very successful.

, If you don't like the way your boss has responded to the issue, or if you don't like the solution your boss has provided, do not be rude. At the end of the day, your boss is the final authority on the decision. By responding irrationally, you might upset your boss and lose your credibility.Remember to keep your voice at an even pitch. Do not talk too loudly, too fast, or too slow. The best thing you can do is listen to your boss, and respond in respectful manner, for example, ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""Thank you,"" and ""Please.""
If you are angry, try not to clench your jaw, and be aware of your facial expressions. Try to maintain either neutral, or positive facial expressions.

Talk to your boss in private.,
Start off on a positive note.,
Acknowledge you've considered your boss's perspective.,
Phrase things in terms of suggestions.,
Avoid using the word ""wrong.""",How to Kindly Tell Your Boss That He or She Is Mistaken2," If you confront your boss in front of a room of people, this is likely to go over poorly. You do not want your boss to feel like you're intentionally embarrassing them. Always choose a private setting to talk over your concerns with your boss, such as your office or your boss's office., You want the conversation have a positive tone overall. Your boss should see this as an opportunity to improve the company rather than a personal failure. Therefore, begin with something positive.Tell your boss something you like about the situation. Note something that's working well for you and the company. No one wants to simply be told what they're doing wrong. Your boss will want to know what they're doing right as well.
For example, ""You're doing an amazing job on the PR work for the after school programs this term. In fact, enrollment has increased by 25%, which is really going to increase profit this term.""

, From there, you want to let your boss know you've heard their side. This way, you won't come off as ungrateful or argumentative. Acknowledge your boss's opinion in a respectful manner before moving forward.Even if you have a more in-depth knowledge of the area than your boss, never start off with something like, ""This is my area of expertise, so I think I know what to do here.""
Instead, say something like, ""I understand you want to save some money by avoiding temps this term. I think that makes a lot of sense, as putting money towards marketing could increase enrollment even more this term.""

, After acknowledging your boss's perspective, give a suggestion on a different route. Never phrase things in terms of commands, as this can seem disrespectful. Instead, present your boss with a suggestion for how to improve the company.Start off with something like, ""I think there may be a better way to handle this."" As you move forward, focus on the benefits of the company.
For example, ""I think hiring one temp could handle the increase in enrollment. We often end up having secretaries do data entry, but that distracts them from dealing with parents. As we've had such a spike in enrollment, we're dealing with a lot more phone calls. I want to make sure our secretaries are able to leave our customers with a good impression of our company, and I worry data entry will distract them.""

, You should never tell your boss, ""You're wrong about this."" You want to make sure your boss knows you still respect them, even though you're disagreeing. If you use the word ""wrong"" at all, exercise extreme caution.For example, you can say something like, ""I noticed you had an estimate of how long data entry may take. I appreciate you taking the time to figure that out for us. However, I think this estimate may be incorrect based on how long data entry took on our end last term.""
Remember to say ""may be wrong"" or ""may be incorrect"" instead of ""is wrong"" or ""is incorrect.""

Offer a solution.,
Ask if you can try your way for a limited time.,
Acknowledge your boss's authority.,
Accept your boss's final decision.",How to Kindly Tell Your Boss That He or She Is Mistaken3," You never want to sound like you're just complaining. You should leave the meeting by offering a logical solution to the problem. You want to come off as helpful rather than negative.Remember to phrase your solution as a suggestion. You don't want your boss to think you're telling them what to do.
For example, ""I suggest we hire a single temp. This won't eat up all of the extra money in our budget, so we can still put a chunk towards advertising. I would be happy to take the time to train the temp myself.""

, You can always ask for a temporary trial run of your proposed solution. This way, your boss can see if your way is more effective without committing to anything longterm.Say something respectful when requesting your solution, and be specific.
For example, ""We can try a very short term temp to see if this does increase productivity. Can we hire someone from a staffing agency for, say, two weeks and see how it goes?""

, The key to a productive discussion with your boss is continued respect. Remember that your boss is your boss, and has final authority. Make sure to leave the situation by mentioning this.End the conversation by saying something like, ""Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I trust you'll make the right decision here.""

, Remember, your boss may not admit they were wrong. They may not agree with your proposed solution, even if you approach them respectfully. Always accept your boss's decision, and don't push the issue once your boss has made up their mind.However, in some cases it's a bad idea to simply accept a decision. If your boss is doing something illegal, for example, you will want to look for another place of work. From there, you can report the illegal activity to the proper outlets.

Be a reliable.,
Be proactive.,
Do not make excuses.,
Project confidence.",How to Impress Your Much Older Boss2," Being reliable will help build trust and show that you are serious about your job. This begins the day you step foot in your office. Your boss will notice that you are consistent and will respect your work ethic. As a reliable worker you should:Be early for work and meetings
Complete your projects and assignments early if possible.
Never turn anything in late
Never show up late for anything
Be careful what you promise and always deliver on what you promise.

, Your actions will impress your boss more than anything you will ever say. If you see something that needs to be done, go ahead and do it. This will show your boss that you are a self-starter.Be willing to do tasks that your coworkers may have overlooked or are unwilling to do. For example, organizing electronic or paper files is not exciting work, but it is valuable and helpful to your workplace.
Listen to your boss and coworkers for hints about things that need to be done. You may overhear conversations about projects that need extra support.

, If you make a mistake, take responsibility for your part. Apologize for what happened and take steps to make sure you do not make the same mistake. Your willingness to apologize and take action will be appreciated.If someone else was involved in the incident, do not blame them or mention their name.
Accept any consequences for your mistake with a good attitude.
Sit and think about what you could have done differently and exactly where you went wrong. It may help to write down your thoughts and a plan of action.

, Even if you feel nervous or intimidated, it is important that you come across as confident and capable. If you doubt yourself, your boss will doubt you as well. Make eye contact, stand up straight, and smile when you are talking to others.Avoid gestures that make you appear nervous such as bouncing your leg up and down, twiddling your thumbs, or playing with your hair or accessories.Do not cross your arms or hide them behind your back either. This makes you appear closed off.

Dress to impress.,
Learn as much as you can about your company.,
Adapt to the office culture.",How to Impress Your Much Older Boss3," Pay attention to how your boss and coworkers dress and then dress a step above everyone else. For example, if everyone is wearing jeans and t-shirts, then you would wear a nice pair of jeans and a button down shirt or blouse. This will help your boss take you more seriously.Be careful not to completely out dress your boss and coworkers. If you work in a casual office, do not wear a suit to work. Always dress appropriately for your office culture.

, As a younger worker, you will be surrounded by people with more experience and knowledge. Your boss needs to see that you are well-informed and can keep up with your coworkers. Read your companyâs website, social media pages, and news releases.Continue to do this even after you are hired. Set aside time each week to read about the field you are working in.
You can also read any websites or publications that are related to your field and profession.

, Pay attention to the time that people come to and leave work. How long are usual lunch breaks? Do people collaborate on work or work silently on their own?For example, if you are supposed to get off at 5:00 pm, but notice that people tend to leave around 5:15 pm, stick around until 5:30 pm. You do not want to be the first out of the door at 5:00 pm on the dot.
You do not want to stand out for the wrong reasons. Adjust your work style so that you fit in with the culture.
If you notice any negative traits such as excessive lunch breaks or socializing too much, do not engage in those. For example, if people tend to have 30 minute conversations that are not related to work, chat for about 5 minutes and then return to your work. You are still socializing without hurting your work performance.

Reflect on your bossâ actions.,
Observe how your boss treats employees.,
Stay organized.,
Document the behavior.,
Practice stealth.",How to Get Your Boss Fired1," What is your boss doing that would warrant being fired? Having a bad personality cannot be grounds to get someone fired. Talk to a trusted colleague or friend about your feelings. Do everything you can to avoid your boss from finding out your thoughts.


Consider looking for another job. It may not be worth the hassle and emotional strain of building a case against your boss.;
, Your boss is on grounds of being dismissed if she disrespects or steals from employees.There needs to be several employees to testify to the truth of this type of disrespect. Inappropriate behavior towards employees includes the following:


Racial or sexual discrimination/âjokes.â Do you work for someone who calls you by a derogatory name or constantly cracks inappropriate jokes about your race, gender and/or religion? These actions are against the law and are concrete grounds for termination.
Abusive behavior. Does your boss drag you into her office (or out in the middle of the office) to scream and berate you when you make an error? There is no room for abusive behavior in the workplace. Everyone should be treated with equal respect.
Unfair management practices. Does your boss play favorites and leave out opportunities for other staff members? Are you and your co-workers given the shaft for certain promotional advances when you are more qualified than the bossâs pet?
Intellectual theft, or stealing another employeeâs ideas and passing them off as her own. Stealing material items isn't the only grounds for theft., In your planning stages, you must take preventative steps in ensuring no one finds out what you are doing. Many corporate computers run on a shared network that your boss has access to. Plan to keep all documentation off your work computer and out of sight.


Depending on how bad the case is, which it should be bad since youâre making a case, youâll need pen and paper, an audio recorder, video camera, and a folder or journal.
You may not need the video camera since most offices contain a security camera that could be used in an investigation.

, Prove that the boss needs to get the heave ho to human resources by meticulously documenting every infraction as they occur.Obtain a journal and write down the time, date and incident following the encounter.
Gather factual evidence such as receipts or records that demonstrate the boss doing something wrong or illegal.
Get photographic or video evidence by placing a hidden camera in the area of the office where you could nab evidence. Keep in mind, however, that taping someone against their knowledge may not be used in a court of law. Having this type of documentation on video or photos will support other evidence.

, You shouldn't bring a tripod and professional grade equipment into work. If you need to photograph or record an incident, use a smartphone. You have all the spy capabilities in your pocket. Smart phones can record video, audio, and take pictures.


Write down details of your boss' actions in private.

Seek out a confidant.,
Think about whether you are the only target or if the boss acts like this with others.,
Document the bad behavior.,
Speak up when the bullying occurs.,
Distinguish between a tough boss and a bully.",How to Handle a Bullying Boss1," It is preferable to choose a friend outside of your work life to discuss your bullying boss situation. This person can help you clarify your thoughts and figure out if you and your boss have a personality conflict or whether true bullying is taking place.


Find a time when you and a close friend can meet in person. Say something like, âI have a situation at work that I need your opinion on. I think my boss may be bullying me, but I want to see what you think.â Then, give your friend several examples of what you consider to be your bossâs problem behavior.
Listen carefully and with an open mind to your friendâs opinions.
Perhaps you are a little sensitive. If so, your friend will be able to help you figure out whether you are being bullied or whether you just have thin skin.
Your friend may also be helpful in offering suggestions on how to deal with your boss.;
, If there are others who are victimized by your boss, consider discreetly talking with them about the situation.


Without mentioning your own situation, see if you can open a conversation with them. Say something like, âIt seems like our boss sometimes acts like a bully to you, such as when he calls you names at meetings.â
If you trust this co-worker, mention your own concerns about your situation. Be sure to ask your colleague to keep all conversation between the two of you private.

, When your boss demonstrates bullying behavior, take note of it and keep the records in a safe place. Each time bullying occurs, write it down with a time and date. If there were any witnesses to the events, write down their names as well.


Note incidents of bullying directed towards others. This can help prove a pattern of bullying.Save e-mails and memos if they have evidence of your bossâs unprofessional or unfair treatment.

, You and your boss may have gotten off on the wrong foot. By asserting yourself early in your relationship, you may be able to re-set how you interact going forward.


Some bosses think that just because you work for them, they can speak with you in any manner when you make mistakes.
The first time this happens, let them know in a kind way that you accept responsibility for the mistake but that you desire to be spoken to in a respectful manner. You could say something like, âI know I didnât finish my project on time, but I do not appreciate you berating me about that in front of the whole staff. We should find a time to discuss my late project in private.â
Another way to approach your boss could be, âI understand we disagree on how to handle this issue, but I donât think resorting to name calling will help us come to a good solution.â
Calmly and assertively standing up for yourself may be all you need to do to deal with your bullying boss, but in many cases you will need to take further action.

, Demanding everyone produce stellar work within established timelines may be the sign of a tough boss, but it is not the sign of a bully. By achieving clarity on what constitutes a bullying boss, you will better be able to deal with the problem.


If your boss is a demanding perfectionist, they may be difficult to work with but want what is best for the company. This type of boss can usually be reasoned with and may not fall under the definition of a âbully.â A bully is intimidating and will be verbally abusive (yelling, cursing) to you. They may also spread rumors about you.Other signs that your boss is a bully include intruding on your privacy, micromanaging your work to the extreme, harshly criticizing your work, and questioning your skills in front of others.A bullying boss may undermine you, by either setting outrageous deadlines or constantly changing the parameters of projects. A bullying boss may also blame you for things beyond your control or block your attempts to be transferred or promoted.

Identify a trusted co-worker(s).,
Be the best employee you can be.,
Be prepared for the worst outcome.,
Look for other jobs.",How to Get Your Boss Fired2," It is vital that you find someone you can trust and include him in on your plan. Take the divide and conquer approach because two heads (or more) are better than one.For example, if youâve been the butt of numerous sexist jokes, confide in a trusted same sex colleague to see if he has experienced something similar.


Start the conversation off without admitting anything. You need to determine if your colleague also feels the same way about your boss as you do. If they admit uneasy feelings about your boss, proceed in including him into your scheme.

, Donât spend all your time invested in your clandestine operation. It is important that you still do the job youâre suppose to do. Make it your mission to be the best employee you can be so no one can point the blame on you. You may even have a boss that decides to try to dig up some dirt on you.


Donât lose sight that you are being paid to work and must fulfill this commitment you made.

, Even in a slam-dunk situation where the boss has been blatantly violating numerous codes or violations, your manager may not go away overnight, or even at all. The boss may know what youâve been up to, or may suspect it, so she may have already tried to cover her evidence.


In the worst situation, your boss may cook up a story that would prove you wrong.
In the event that it looks like your manager may not get fired, consider if you can stand to continue work at the company., While being on top of your current position will help secure your job, you might be happier working somewhere else. Search the internet for job listings calling for your position. Even if you choose not to apply, having the options could ease the tensions at work. It never hurts to look and you might find a better opportunity.

Finalize your evidence.,
Request to meet with your HR.,
Follow the chain of command.,
Contact the EEOC.",How to Get Your Boss Fired3," Assemble a professional report that includes documentation and factual paperwork to back up your claim. Donât hand the higher ups or human resources a fist full of scribbled cocktail napkins and sticky notes. Transfer all of your written notes into a typed and cohesive report.


If you have receipts, video, or photographic evidence, present them in a binder or folder. Making a professional presentation will send a message that this is serious and goes well beyond your boss having a bad day.

, Meet with the human resources manager to present your report. When you make your appointment, let the manager know why you want to meet with her. Ask about confidentiality and whether you can submit your findings anonymously.Try to leave emotions at the door when you meet with human resources. Try to divorce yourself from the situation and approach it as if you are presenting the material on the behalf of someone else.Donât name call. During the meeting, be as professional as possible. Never say that your manager is simply a âbad personâ or âevil,â but instead lay out the facts and your report in a calm, confident manner.
Thank the human resources manager for her time. Be gracious with regard to the meeting. Be sure the human resource professional knows that you are thankful that your case is being heard.

, If you work for a smaller firm that doesnât have a HR department, youâll need to talk to the next best thing. In many cases of a small, family run business, there are slim chance of your boss being fired. Most businesses consist of this type of structure: top-level managers, middle managers, first-level managers, and then the staff.


A likely hierarchy of a small company may be the owner, manager, department manager, supervisor, and then the staff.
Talk to someone in the chain of command who is higher than your boss. If your supervisor is repeatedly out of line, try talking to their manager.
When dealing with smaller firms, you must insist that your hearing be confidential.

, If you're uncomfortable talking to your company about a boss, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This is a federal organization responsible for employment and anti-discrimination laws. This can include incidents of managerial abuse that violates anti-discrimination laws.


You'll need to file a claim with the EEOC that will include the research and reports you've prepared.
The EEOC will contact you with further steps that may include a lawsuit against the company.

Get the offer in writing.",How to Negotiate a Salary," Before you can negotiate, you need to know how much people in comparable positions make. You can find this information in a variety of ways.


Talk with colleagues. Co-workers may be hesitant to talk about their salaries. Nevertheless, you can still ask. If you are negotiating a pay raise at your company, then your coworkers remain your best resource for finding out your companyâs pay scale.
Research at Glassdoor or PayScale. Both of these website provide salary information for particular companies. You can find out what the average salary is for the position at your target company.
Research companies of comparable size. If no information exists about the company you are interviewing at, then you will want to find salary ranges for companies of comparable size in the same city or geographic area. You can also find this information on Glassdoor or PayScale. You may also want to do a general web search.
Look online if you are working for a government agency. Many states will post this information online. For example, you can view Californiaâs state worker salary database by clicking here. For federal jobs, you can view salaries by agency and job title by clicking here.;
, Effective negotiation requires that you know two numbers: how much you would ideally get, and the least amount you would settle for. You negotiate with the first number in mind, and you walk away from the job (or stop negotiating) if the employer cannot meet the second number.


Donât set the range too low. Research shows that women in particular tend to undervalue their worth.Instead, look at the salary ranges already offered in the field and location and consider what unique skills or experiences you can bring to the company that will increase your worth.
Also think through any trade-offs that you might settle for.For example, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower salary for increased vacation time or personal days.

, Effective negotiation involves more than simply spouting out a number to someone across the table. You also want to give a few short reasons why you think that you are worth the amount that you are asking for. You should come up with your reasons ahead of time.

, There are a couple different kinds of negotiators. One is hard-style and likely to say, âNo.â The other type is a âsoft-styleâ negotiator who comes across as agreeable. You need to prepare for both, because both present different challenges as you negotiate.To negotiate effectively with the hard-style negotiator, you have to be in the right frame of mind. Do not get rattled by an assertive âNo.â Instead, be prepared to justify the amount that you are asking for. You must also maintain a positive attitude, even in the face of resistance.
To negotiate effectively with a âsoft-styleâ negotiator, you must focus on not trying to get the negotiator to like you. Instead, you must approach the negotiation as a bargaining opportunity. Soft-style negotiators can be problematic especially when you already know the negotiatorâfor example, she may already be your boss and you are negotiating a raise. You need to stop worrying that you might harm the relationship and instead focus on getting a salary you deserve., If you donât like to negotiate, then you should practice various scenarios before speaking to the employer. One way to practice is to look in a mirror and state out loud what your ideal salary is and why you think you are worth it. Imagine the employer saying âNoâ and practice your counter-offer.


You can also enlist the help of a friend. He or she can pretend to be the boss. Work out different scenarios. For example, have the friend be a firm negotiator, saying âNoâ repeatedly, so that you can become accustomed to hearing that kind of resistance. Then alternate, and have the friend be open to negotiation.
Focus on keeping your enthusiasm up during the process, which is critical for your success in negotiations., If you are interviewing for a job, then postpone for as long as you can any discussion of salary. The key is to make sure that prospective employers fall in love with you before you begin to discuss money. If the employer asks you what your salary requirements are, try to re-direct the conversation. Say, âBefore getting into that, Iâd like to hear a little more aboutâ¦âYou should certainly wait until you have a job offer before discussing salary. However, the employer may require that applicants put their required salary in a cover letter. If required to do so, then follow the directions. But be sure to list your preferred salary as a range, e.g., $40,000-50,000.If you subsequently discover that the salary you listed on your cover letter is too low, then you can adjust it during the negotiations by stating that you didnât realize the full job responsibilities when you wrote your cover letter.By saying this, you can give yourself a reason for increasing the amount you want.

, By following this strategy, you can avoid naming a number that is too low. If the employer asks you to give a number, you can counter in several ways:ask what the typical range is for employees in this position at the company
ask how much has been budgeted for the position
say youâll consider any reasonable offer
say that they have better information as to what would be a reasonable offer

, Once an initial offer is made, you should not accept it. Employers expect negotiation, so their initial offer typically includes some room for them to move up.Instead of accepting the first offer, counter-offer by asking for your ideal amount. If your ideal is $48,000 but the initial offer is for $35,000, then ask for $48,000. The employer is not going to move up to $48,000 on his or her own. You need to be prepared to ask for it.

, You can benefit by offering a few quick reasons why you think you are justified in asking for the salary. For example, you may have led your prior company to record growth in the previous year. You can say, âI appreciate the offer and am really excited to work for you. But given my drive and history of performance, I was expecting something in the $50,000 range.âAlso be direct. If you want more money, then say that. Do not try to convey that you want more money by talking about your expenses. For example, donât state, âWell I just bought a new car, so my expenses are really high.âInstead, say, âI need more than thatâ or âI need a higher salary.â

, You should negotiate with confidence, sure of your worth. If the employer cannot meet at least your minimum, then you should be willing to walk away. However, you do not need to boast of that fact or issue ultimatums.Donât say, âForty thousand is my final offer!â Instead, say, âI need at least $40,000 to make switching jobs worthwhile.â
Always negotiate with professionalism and respect.Often, salary negotiations are initiated after an informal offer has been made but before a formal offer has been extended. You donât want anything you do in the salary negotiations to cast doubt on the employer hiring you for the job.

, Remember that base pay is only one topic of negotiation. After you have taken care of it, move on to the following:minimum severance pay
performance expectations
perquisites and benefits
the schedule for future salary increases

, To effectively negotiate, you need to mentally separate yourself from the process. Remember that you donât know everything about the businessâs financial health, so perhaps the company is constrained in what it can offer you. Also, companies are under pressure to reduce overhead, and salaries are a big part of expenses. A salary offer that is lowering than what you would hope for is not a judgment on you personally.


Always remember that negotiating a salary is a business transaction.You would not be terribly offended if someone offered you less than you wanted for vegetables that you grew in your garden or a craft that you made in your spare time. Similarly, donât be offended if the employer is resistant to offering you the salary that you want.

, Once you receive a final offer, you should ask for a couple of days to review. You want the time to clear your mind and look at the offer objectively. Most employers should give you a few days to a week to consider the offer.Even if your first instinct is to decline because the salary is too low, you should take the time to review the offer. Maybe an increase in benefits will help offset the low salary. Only by giving yourself time to review the whole offer can you make a sound decision as to whether to accept or reject the offer.

, Once you have agreed to a salary and a benefits package, ask for everything in writing. Your employer should have no problem memorializing the offer in writing.If the employer does resist, then you should reconsider working for this company. It is standard business practice to reduce contract offers to writing.

Request time off when you need it.",How to Explain a Chronic Illness to an Employer1," If your chronic illness does not interfere with your job, you don't need to tell your boss about it, even during the hiring interview. But if it has developed while working, or a debilitating flareup has occurred that you were not aware would happen, there are a few people you should talk to.Start with your doctor. Your doctor can inform you best of what accommodations you need and how much you should reveal at work.
Find out if your company has a health representative. People in this position are experienced at helping employees with chronic conditions, and they can tell you who you need to inform about your illness.
Tell Human Resources (HR). You only need to approach HR if your chronic illness requires special treatment like extra breaks, a different work schedule, and so on.
After you disclose special needs with HR, tell employees who work closely with you, including your supervisor. Your HR representative will tell you how to approach these co-workers, whether it is best done in person or through email.;
, Remember that you only need to give your employer information about how your condition may impact you on the job, whether during the hiring interview or after hiring if a new condition has developed. It is not necessary for you to reveal any specifics about your treatments or medications unless you want to.


Anything you reveal to your employer about your chronic disease is protected under federal laws, so that may help you in determining how much or little you want to reveal.
Allow your employer to ask questions as they wish, but remember they only need to know the information that will make a difference on the job.

, Itâs important to your health to only do as much as you can do. Tell your employer if you need to be out for a length of time due to your illness.


Your health is a priority and, by law, your place of employment is required to work with you on appropriate accommodations for your illness, especially if it does not interfere with the quality of work for which you were hired.
Discuss the option of a long-term medical leave (FMLA) with your employer if that would be better for your health.
Look into filing for FMLA if you start to miss too many days at work. Your company may have a policy about excessive absences that prevents them from helping you if you miss too many days of work without an explanation. FMLA stands for Family and Medical Leave Act."

Schedule a meeting.,
Remain calm.,
Document the meeting.",How to Handle a Bullying Boss2," If you have tried a few times to address your bossâs bullying behavior immediately after it occurred and nothing changed, it may be more productive to schedule a meeting for a less emotional time.


Choose a private setting for your conversation. A neutral location, like a conference room, or an off-site location, such as a coffee shop, is better for the meeting than your bossâs office.
Invite a representative from your HR department to sit in on the meeting.

, It may seem intimidating to confront your bullying boss, but it is a vital step in developing a better workplace relationship and standing up for yourself. If you maintain a sense of control over your emotions and speak objectively, you will be more persuasive and can help keep the conversation from becoming overheated.


Donât be accusatory. State the issues in your own words and offer ways you both can work together.Stick to the facts and be professional. You can say something like, âI donât appreciate you calling me names, and I hope we can have more productive, professional interactions in the future.â
Cite specific examples: âIt is not appropriate for you to yell at me in front of the entire marketing team.â
If you stand up for yourself, the bully may back down.

Make clear that you feel unsafe or that your future employment is jeopardized because of your bullying boss.Maintain a calm demeanor while presenting your case.
If others in your department were also bullied, ask whether they will accompany you to the meeting with HR.
At the end of the conversation, find out what the next steps are. Write up a summary of the meeting and send a copy to the HR representative and keep one for yourself.

, If you are a good employee, most businesses would rather you transfer within the company rather than leave due to a clash of personalities with your present manager.

, If the bullying is race based or involves sexual harassment, your boss may be violating state or federal laws. Remember, however, that bullying in itself is not against the law.


Most workplace experts suggest only hiring an attorney if you feel you have a strong case that the bullying is race or gender based., If your boss does not change behavior after meeting with them or asking the HR department to intervene, you may have no choice but to find another job.

Take care of your mental and physical needs so that the bullying does not affect your health.
Have outlets outside of work for socializing and reducing stress.Take a few walking breaks during the day to lower your stress level and get some fresh air.
Seek out a counselor who specializes in workplace issues and work with them to develop coping skills.

, Bully bosses may be more likely to pick on employees who donât socialize much with others or are alone a lot. To counter this, develop friendships with coworkers and be social with others when possible., Despite the bullying you face from your boss, try to keep your cool and demonstrate that you are just there to do your job. Continue to show up to work on time and complete your projects in a timely manner.


Donât respond to the bullying with an outburst of your own. Try to either diffuse the situation or simply leave the area without responding.
Develop good relationships with others in the office. That way, you will be viewed as a true professional if ever there is a choice between you and the bully.

, Although acknowledging situations that set off your boss does not excuse the bad behavior, this may be useful in helping you avoid some of your bossâs wrath. If your boss tends to act out when corporate supervisors are in town or when the fiscal year ends, try to see if there is a way to diffuse the situation before the bullying starts., Bullies prey on those they consider weak, so donât let them know that they are getting to you emotionally. Do not take bullying personally. Reframe the bullying behavior as a knock against your boss instead of a criticism of yourself.


Donât let the bully see you cry or get upset by their behavior.
If necessary, go to your car or the restroom to decompress or even cry after a bullying episode, rather than breaking down in front of the bully. Just ignore the inflammatory comment and change the subject, or assert yourself calmly and professionally.

Report any mistreatment.",How to Explain a Chronic Illness to an Employer2," The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not provide a list of specific disabilities. Instead, the law states that those ""qualified individuals with disabilities"" may not be discriminated against by employers.The ADA states that âqualified individuals with disabilitiesâ are individuals who can perform the essential functions of the position, not necessarily marginal or incidental parts of the job., Your employer is required by law, according to the ADA, to make adjustments that will help any employee with a known disability.Let your employer know if there are any environmental changes that they can make to improve your condition and productivity at work.


You may be able to get a different chair if you have a chronic back condition or an enclosed office if you are more susceptible to catching airborne viruses.
The same goes for working a modified schedule. Make it known if working fewer hours each day would improve your situation, or maybe working more hours for fewer days would be better.
Discuss all the possibilities with your employer.

, Provide information from your doctor or another resource whether your boss asks for it or not. Being prepared with documentation not only validates your requests for accommodation, it makes you look prepared and credible.


Ask your doctor to write your employer a letter or send in a few pamphlets that may help in understanding your illness more fully.
If you can find research that explains how your illness is considered a disability, print this out (or make copies) to hand in to your boss.

, Employees are allowed up to 12 weeks of medical leave for a variety of reasons, including chronic conditions. You should see HR for the two forms you need in order to file for FMLA as soon as you realize you need time off.


Employees cannot file for FMLA until they have worked for 12 months and at least 1,250 hours at their company.FMLA is not required to be paid leave, so if an employer decides not to give you sick leave for a time beyond what you have earned, you can't dispute it.
Employees who work for employers with fewer than 50 employees are not eligible for FMLA.

, If you feel you are being treated unfairly by your employer, report it to your supervisor. If this doesnât work, go to Human Resources. There are laws like the ADA in place to protect you in this situation.


You may need proof of mistreatment. Before meeting with an employer, ask if you can record the session on a device, or perhaps dialogue with your boss through email so that the interaction is captured in writing.
Keep in mind that as an employee with a disability, your job is to perform the essential parts of your job. If you cannot perform these parts because of flare-ups of your chronic illness, request time off so the illness doesnât prevent you from being protected by the ADA.

File for disability.",How to Explain a Chronic Illness to an Employer3," If you are hired for a job when your chronic illness is under control, you may not notice that certain essential tasks are difficult to accomplish. If this occurs, talk to your employer about changing positions within the company.


For example, if you were hired for an active position that is making your chronic condition worse, present your paperwork skills to your boss and request to be moved into an administrative position.
The opposite can also be attempted. For example, if you have carpal tunnel and typing at a desk all day is causing increased pain, present your skills and ask to be transferred into a position that does not stress the wrists.

, If there are no positions open in your company that you may be transferred toâkeeping in mind that the ADA cannot protect you once you lose the ability to perform the essential functions of the job for which you were hiredâit may be time to seek different employment.


Be sure you inquire about jobs for which you can perform the essential functions, even when your chronic illness flares up.
Let the employer know when you are interviewed of your chronic illness, especially if you believe it will interfere with the essential parts of the position that were listed in the job advertisement.
Donât be ashamed of your limitations. Instead, be confident in what you are able to do and are good at, and employers will believe in them, too. Keep in mind that they are not allowed to discount you because of your illness if you can perform the tasks they advertised for.

, Many chronic illnesses have organizations that support individuals. And many organizations exist to help individuals with general chronic pain, no matter the origin.For example, the Invisible Disabilities Association exists to help people when they develop chronic illnesses and donât know where to begin finding assistance., If your illness prevents you from performing work entirely, you can apply for Social Security disability insurance. You must run through a gamut of paperwork, including proving that you canât get hired at any job. But eventually, if you are approved, you will receive a monthly stipend based on your lifetime earnings.Two years on this disability insurance automatically qualifies you for Medicare.
If you arenât working and your income from the disability insurance is below a certain level (different for each state), you will mostly likely qualify for Medicaid, which equals free or low-cost health insurance for those covered.

Your boss might blame others for things that go wrong at the workplace, or may assume that people are out to get them or their job. This isnât a reflection of anything that youâve done wrong and indicates your bossâs self-doubt., Many insecure bosses are indecisive and fail to give their employees a clear sense of direction. Then, theyâll hide in their office or have regular out-of-office engagements, making them more or less unavailable. Disorder is frustrating for you, and knowingly or not, can help your boss feel needed and important. Rather than play hide and seek, approach the situation directly and ask for clarification and direction in writing.This works well with transparency. Send your boss regular email messages asking for direction and clarification. Because this will become routine, your boss should eventually feel comfortable giving you some guidance.
You can develop a routine of following up, for example, and send an email after each conversation that says, âDear Ms. _____, Per our conversation today at 3:30 pm, I will go ahead and get the Johnson file in order and sent to the Records department. Would you like me to send a copy to Mr. Bates in Processing as well?â

, Insecure bosses will often micromanage their employees in an effort to maintain control and a sense of power and importance. This can be nerve wracking for employees and exhausting for the insecure boss. Fortunately, you donât have to sit back and take it. Be proactive in earning your bossâs trust, showing them that you can work independently and that you wonât betray them.Transparency is excellent here too because your boss will have little to micromanage if theyâre left in the loop of your work day.
You can send your boss a message at the beginning of each shift that says something like, âDear Mr. Foster, As we discussed yesterday, I will be alphabetizing the 2015-6 files, unless something has come up that youâd like me to work on beforehand.â

, If you have an insecure boss, then you may feel frustrated on a daily basis. However, it is important to avoid acting on your frustration in passive-aggressive ways. Instead, try to find some productive ways that you can handle your frustrations.Take a brisk walk on your lunch break.
Close your door or take a bathroom break for five minutes and do some deep breathing.
Chat with a supportive coworker during lunch.

Get others on your team.,
Know your bossâs personality.,
Understand where your boss is coming from.,
Start with common ground.,
Discuss your intentions.,
Be respectful.,
Make an argument, but donât argue.,
Be cautiously passionate.,
Back down when youâve lost.,
Disagree for the right reason.,
Pick your battles.,
Time your disagreement well.,
Be a good employee.,
Know your stuff.,
Have a plan in place.",How to Disagree with Your Boss," See if your idea is popular with other employees, and if so, you can respectfully make that known to your boss. Donât make the boss feel ganged up on, but let them know that there is popular support for your idea.Do say: âA few of the other people in my department have also expressed concerns about...â
Donât say: âEveryone else in my department thinks your idea will be a disaster, and they would rather...â;
, Are they persuaded by hard data, or are they more likely to respond to personal, relatable anecdotes? Communicate with your boss in a way they are more likely to relate to.Come prepared with charts and graphs if theyâre a numbers person.
Anticipate your bossâs objections to your argument, and try to have a relatable anecdote up your sleeve for each objection if theyâre more persuaded by personal stories than numbers.

, Assuming that your boss is an intelligent, well-meaning person, they are probably not setting out to cause harm to you, other employees, or your company. Try to think about what you know about your bossâs personal and professional life. Is there anything there that might be leading them to make this decision? Can you relate to them on the level theyâre coming from?Ask trusted colleagues who are more familiar with your boss if they have any insight.
Also remember that your boss is likely in a position of power because they have experience or expertise.

, There will likely be some part of your bossâs idea that you agree with. Begin by discussing that aspect of the plan, and then move the conversation toward the part of their idea that you disagree with.Do say: âI really like what you said about ... and I think that we could make that idea even better if we...â
Donât say: âThe only thing I agree with you on is...â

, Sometimes when a boss gets angry at an employee for disagreeing with them, itâs because they feel threatened or like their employee is arguing just for the sake of arguing. Let your boss know up front that your intentions are for the betterment of the company, and that you arenât trying to undermine them, get out of doing work, or hurt the company in any way.Do say: âI think that we could provide better customer service to our clients by...â
Donât say, âI could get out of here a lot sooner every day if...â

, Make it clear from the very beginning of the conversation that you respect their ideas and their leadership. Remember that you can be perfectly honest while still showing respect.Avoid a confrontational tone.
At the same time, donât hedge a lot or apologize too much. Your boss wonât take you seriously.

, The difference here is very subtle. Donât be argumentative, attack other peopleâs views, or complain. Instead, spend your energy on making clear, concise points. Explain the logic behind your point of view, but donât denigrate your bossâs point of view or anyone elseâs., Make it clear that you care about this topic, and your boss will be more likely to listen. On the other hand, avoid excessive emotion -- no crying or yelling. Stick with confident, calm speech., If your boss isnât going to budge, itâs time to throw in the towel. Graciously tell your boss that you respect their decision, and move on. Make sure they know that you still support and respect them., Really examine your motives behind bringing up your disagreement. If any part of you is disagreeing in order to try to gain power or authority, you might want to reconsider. Be sure that your disagreement will truly add something valuable to the conversation., Chances are good that you will disagree with your boss many times throughout your professional relationship. Disagreeing over the placement of the new printer probably isnât worth your time, but a conversation about saving the company lots of money on printers might be a battle worth fighting., Don't wait until your boss is about to go into a meeting or leave for the day to tell them your thoughts. Pick a time of day when you know they are less likely to be stressed out. Particularly if you work for a large company, think about scheduling a meeting to talk., Your boss is much more likely to listen to you if you have established a reputation as a valuable employee. Meet your deadlines, show up on time, and produce quality work. Do extra work once in awhile. Show that youâre a team player., If you have an opinion but donât have any facts to back it up, this is not the time to disagree with your boss. You will appear lazy and perhaps even ignorant, and thatâs never a good way to look in front of your boss. Prepare for future arguments by learning as much as possible about your company and the way it runs., Studies have shown that, long before itâs time to tell your boss you disagree with them, itâs best to have a conversation with your boss about how you will both manage emotions when you disagree. Asking your boss how they would like to be treated and letting them know the same about you will go a long way toward smoothing things out later."
"
Take direction.,
Accept responsibility.,
Be proactive.,
Communicate regularly.,
Connect with them.,
Be respectful.,
Work to resolve conflict.,
Be positive.,
Embrace the company culture.,
Act as a team player.",How to Get Along with Your Boss," Make sure that youâre open to input from coworkers and supervisors. By being open to taking direction, youâll show that youâre a team player who is willing to listen to and work with others.


Listen to the advice of coworkers. Use every interaction as an opportunity to learn and to become a model employee. For example, if you're working on a collaborative project, follow the lead of senior employees and ask them questions so you understand their process better.
Be attentive during your training process. Make sure youâre focused on learning everything your trainer or supervisor is teaching you. For example, if your trainer is showing you how to restart a piece of machinery, try to verbally repeat the steps that they're taking so you internalize the process better.
Avoid thinking you know best. Remember, it is likely that your coworkers or supervisors have been doing this a lot longer than you. If they havenât, they might have some experience or insight you donât have.;
, The hallmark of any model employee is one that accepts responsibility for both their positive and negative actions. By accepting responsibility, youâll show accountability and the maturity that characterizes model employees.


Own up to any mistake you make. For example, if you lost an important client, let your boss know.
Let your boss know that you learn from your successes and failures. For example, after losing an account, let your boss know that you didnât understand the temperamental nature of the client, and that youâll pay more attention to the intricacies of clientsâ personalities so you can cater to them better.
Never hide, deny, or lie about any negative outcome in the workplace. For example, embellishing or lying about your success or progress on a specific project as a junior employee may get you into trouble if your employer things you can handle more responsible than you are ready for., The best employees are ones that put themselves out in front of issues that confront the business every day. By being proactive, youâll show your boss that youâre a go-getter and a real model employee.


Volunteer for challenging assignments. For instance, if your boss asks for volunteers to deal with a problem client, volunteer if you think you can help. Remember, you donât need to volunteer every time your boss asks for volunteers, but make sure you do so semi-regularly.
Be a problem solver â think outside the box to solve longstanding problems. For instance, if you encounter logistics problems in your job daily (i.e. youâre unable to ship a product fast enough to a client), try to find a new, innovative, way to get your product out. For example, contact different shippers or consider arranging with a third party to house your product closer to important clients.
Donât ask to be micromanaged. One of the biggest things bosses and supervisors dislike is having to micromanage their employees. Thus, avoid emailing or calling your boss with questions that you could otherwise answer yourself. If you need help, look to a coworker or to the employee manual before inquiring with your boss., Communication is key to a positive and fruitful relationship with your boss. Without regular communication, you wonât be able to develop a working relationship. In addition, you wonât be apprised of team efforts and the progress of company initiatives.


Always respond promptly to your bossâs email or calls. Try to respond to calls or emails your boss places during work hours within an hour or two. Never respond more than 24 hours after receiving an email or call during the work week.
Attend all meetings with your boss. In addition, show up on time.
Check in with your boss or offer them status updates on your projects from time to time. This doesnât mean you should keep them apprised of your daily affairs, rather, send them an email every two weeks or every month letting them know about some of your accomplishments and challenges., Spend some time trying to connect with your boss as a colleague and a mentor. This will show them that you value, respect, and even look up to them.


Ask them for advice. For instance, ask something like âMrs. Fuller, Iâm having trouble meeting the needs of one of our clients, what would you do if you were in my situation?â
Inquire about their experience as a junior employee. Say something like âMr. Alcott, can you share some of the challenges you met when you first joined the company?â
Engage them in discussion about their personal life in a limited capacity. Asking your boss about how their daughter is doing during her first year of college is acceptable â and a good way to connect. However, donât ask them about their marital relations or anything more personal., One of the easiest ways to alienate your boss is to show them that you donât respect them as a person or as a manager. Thus, you should show your boss that you value them and the supervision and guidance they provide you on a daily basis.


Always address your boss by their preferred title, âMr.â âMrs.â or âDr.â Never address your boss by their first name or a nickname unless they specifically tell you to do so. This goes for electronic communication like email and texts, too.
Donât underestimate the importance of pleasantries like âplease,â âthank youâ or even âIâm sorry.â
Never interrupt your boss while they are speaking.
Listen to your boss whenever they speak to you. For instance, whenever you have a meeting or even casual interaction with them, stop what youâre doing and internalize what they are saying., While communicating, connecting, and respecting your boss will go a long way, you might inevitably find yourself in conflict with your boss. If this happens, you need to work diligently to quickly resolve the issue.


Never insult your boss.
Accept their resolution, if it is reasonable.
Avoid contradicting your boss, if possible.
Apologize, if appropriate.
If you find it hard to resolve conflict, or to accept your boss's resolution, you may consider escalating it to a higher level supervisor. This, though, may create obstacles to advancement in your career., A positive attitude is key in showing that you are a valued and needed part of the organization. If youâre not positive, people â your coworkers and supervisors â wonât want to work with you.


Emphasize the good. For example, when talking to someone about a problem you are experiencing at work, explain it as an opportunity for growth, rather than something that frustrates you. In addition, emphasize the good in people â clients, coworkers, or others â instead of the bad.
Avoid demonstrating negative body language, such as being hunched over, crossing your arms, or grinding your teeth. Instead, you should smile and hold yourself in an inviting and relaxed posture.
Whenever anyone asks how youâre doing, share something positive, rather than negative. For example, if your boss asks you how you like the weather (and itâs raining), tell them that rain makes you feel cozy., A company culture is the specific viewpoint, practices, and ideas embraced by a specific business. By embracing the company culture, youâll show your boss that youâre not only a team player, but that you identify with the goals of the company.


Read the history of your company. In addition, read any literature or employee handbooks.
Attend workshops and other gatherings where management and employees meet â you âll learn a lot about the company culture at these gatherings.
Notice how everyone, including your boss, does things. Donât try to shake things up or to get things done your own way. For example, if you notice that meetings usually run long and people talk about trivial things, that may be how things are done in your organization. Donât attack it., When you act as a team player, you let everyone around you know that you not only take your job seriously, but that you also value them as individuals and as professionals.


Never shirk your responsibilities when you do collaborative work. If youâre tasked with some sort of group work, show yourself to be a team player and a collaborator, rather than someone who needs to be directed by another junior employee.
Always highlight how others helped you when you make any major accomplishments at work. For example, if you make some sort of breakthrough in the laboratory, make sure you say something like âI couldnât have done it without the help of Lydia and Theodore.â
Donât criticize others for their faults, rather, offer them guidance and mentor them. If your boss sees you mentoring another employee, theyâll likely think of you more highly.
Attend all work meetings and gatherings. This includes weekend gatherings like family BBQs and holiday engagements. Youâll show that you can not only be a member of the work team, but a member of the company family, too."
"
Start by using insight.,
Start by training your team member from the beginning of a call.,
Consider the tone and speed of your voice.,
Consider the middle and end of the call--both the middle and end are crucial.,
Ensure that the people who are on the phone actually know what they're talking about.,
Look into using DVD or video training programs.,
Send your staff members for elocution or drama/theatrical lessons if they're working in a high-profile office.,
Do phone role plays.,
Consider the cultural influences of your customers.,
Continue to monitor the changes.",How to Train Employees in Better Phone Skills," When you make a call yourself, what are the things that really annoy you? It might be people who have little product or technical knowledge when that's precisely what you're calling for. You may be annoyed by people who use particular terms, slang or sounds (such as a drawn out ""ummmm"" noise), sounds that tend to imply they're not that interested in talking to you.


Consider these ""annoyances"" and write them all down.
Evaluate yourself in a training context; if you have phone handling issues, it is not recommended that you train others, but that, instead, you attend the training yourself and then test the improvements.;
, The greeting and the speed that the phone is picked up can determine the customer's overall impression of the experience.


In many cases, if the phone rings more than three times, it is too long; for the caller, boredom starts to set in. On the other hand, people who pick up almost instantly may startle the caller. Try to find a middle ground such as picking up after the first ring, but before the second.
Consider the greeting. Many people find a greeting such as ""Hi, this is Jack speaking"" subtly annoying, as they assume the person's name is really ""Jack Speaking"", or that such an automated, informal response is suggestive of someone who is not able to help them sort out a problem. A simple improvement is ""Hi, this is Jack, how can I help you?""

, Again, consider what things really annoy you--it might be speaking too fast, too slowly, in a very loud or quiet voice, or someone who places too much emphasis on certain tones (such voices that may be described as too ""bubbly"" or ""bouncy""), or tones that are very flat, which suggest disinterest in the caller (always a risky thing in a service center). Find out if your staff members exhibit any of these traits by listening to their calls. You might also find almost-automated responses infuriating, as though you're talking to someone who is clearly reading from a prompt screen, like a zombie.

, Many perfectly good calls have been ruined by a bad ending, much like an excellent meal ruined by poor service at the cashier's desk when leaving--just one small thing that is wrong anywhere along the course of the meal can cause disappointment with regards to the whole event.


A near-automated ""Have a nice day"" finale can turn people off with regards to having anything to do with your company, because if the words lack sincerity it implies the customer service contact likewise has no sincerity.
Also, consider the overall length of the call. If your office usually has in-depth and complex queries that take a while on the phone to sort out, then adequate time should be given to the client. At the other end of the spectrum, rushing a call or limiting call time can make the other person feel like they aren't important, whereas making the call much longer than necessary can also become an issue. Train for quality over quantity. Employee knowledge of their industry and product is important in the role your office plays as a consultant.

, This may mean that additional product or technical knowledge training is required, or making it clear when it is appropriate to recommend referral of the caller to someone who can help as soon as possible.


For individual cases, actually call the employee you want to talk to. Quite often you can find out very quickly what could be a cause for concern, as this person may have a wonderful social manner face to face, but be rather unpleasant on the phone.

, Another alternative is to use similar one-to-one or group courses. It's actually useful to pair people up and role play for the purpose of letting people develop their own insight. As they review the manner in which they make the role-play calls, they may become more aware of their own phone mannerisms and how to self-improve.


Avoid the ""training recordings"" as a learning method. It's quite an old fashioned method to record and replay phone calls for training sessions, while everyone listens to a coworker on a call. This can backfire as no one knows if their calls are being listened to ""Big Brother"" style and it may put them on edge, especially when a caller is being particularly confrontational, or the phone handler is having a bad day that may be unusual.

, This is also an excellent trick for smaller companies as well. The caller can be encouraged to imagine a person at the other end as someone who is likely wearing a suit in a huge office, but who in reality is sitting in an informal small-business office, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, operating from a large, busy corporate call center. Stage techniques are surprisingly influential and can help a person express themselves more clearly and confidently.


A good example is the frequently suggested technique of smiling when you pick up the phone, but it works the other way, too; it's detectable to clients when the person at the other end is trying to sound happy and helpful, but isn't really--it's like grinning through your teeth, or hiding your misery, it still comes through. It's best to relax the face and throat (something that is taught in drama classes) to be able to speak more naturally and pleasantly. A gentle smile is fine, especially when it is sincere and reaches not just your face, but also your eyes.

, Go through the calls from greeting to closure, and experiment with different types of user personalities, allowing your analysts to respond in the moment. Once completed, take the time to discuss the ways it could have been handled differently afterwards. This is both a fun and effective way to check that the training is working., What is appropriate for some is not always appropriate for other people, and this can cause a fair amount of problems when misunderstandings arise.


For example, many customers prefer to get straight down to business and value speed and efficiency; however, some clients prefer to essentially ""chat"" for a short time to build a brief personal connection,trust before moving on to the main purpose of the call.
Another major consideration is in regard to time zone differences. In many parts of the world, phone workers call during their daytime, but it may not be daytime on the other side of the world where the client is. Many people, when interrupted during their sleep, or during mealtime or family time when outside of work, may find such intrusions intolerable.
Avoid mimicking the person's accent, or using slang that is local to your client's area or culture on the other end of the phone. In some cases it can be acceptable and make the person receiving the call feel more at ease, but this is actually a very small and rare demographic. Many people find a false accent to be insincere and fraudulent, or copying an accent as a sign of disrespect.

, Interestingly, it gets easier when people know how to handle a call well. For sincere, customer service focused people, you can expect to see them bloom and possibly become customer service managers in their own right in the near future.


For people who struggle, or who quickly revert back to their old ways, it may be the result of other conditions such as personal or office relationship issues, and/or hardware, system or procedural issues. Or, maybe they just aren't a customer service person. These people should at best be given non-phone work, but also should be encouraged to seek improvement on their own, skills as it is not just the company who can benefit from increased skills.

Choose an original.,
Wipe down the glass.,
Keep the machine clean.",How to Make Great Photocopies1," Make sure the original is in good condition. Crisp and clean originals will make the best copies. When possible print originals on heavy weight paper from an inkjet or laser printer so they are fresh and of a high, clear quality.


Undo any folds or creases. These may interfere with copy clarity. These do not transfer well to copies and can obstruct copy text or images. Remove staples, tape, torn pages, etc. before making copies. Smooth paper feeds easily through the machine and has less chance of getting jammed or damaged.;
, Foreign objects like dust or dirt on the glass can cause blemishes on your copies. Cleaning glass thoroughly can make for a cleaner copy.


Unplug the machine to start cleaning the glass. Then apply a small amount of glass cleaner to a soft sponge and gently wipe away dirt. Dry immediately with a lint free cloth. Remember to never apply liquid directly to the glass as this can leak into the machine and cause expensive damage. , Cautious handling of the copy machine simplifies the photocopying process, saves time, and prevents waste, poor quality copies, and machine damage.


Avoid placing fingertips directly on the copy glass. This prevents transfer of dirt and oils from your hand to the machine.
Never place sticky-notes over an original. The residue of the sticky part can attract dirt that will harm both the original and the machine.

Be transparent.,
Share opportunities with your boss.,
Link your success to your boss.,
Seek your bossâs guidance.",How to Deal With an Insecure Boss2," There is little that fuels anxiety and self-doubt like the unknown. Your bossâs insecurity may be aggravated if they are unclear about who youâre talking with, what steps youâre taking to complete a task, or what your vision is for the future. While it may seem unnecessary and time consuming, get in the habit of letting your boss know what youâre up to by sending emails, showing them records or receipts, and talking with them in meetings.Try not to be too obvious, as that may have the exact opposite effect that you want. Instead, establish a routine between you and your boss, such as checking in every other day via email to let them know your progress and your agenda for the next day.
You can send an email that says, âDear Ms. Brown, I followed up with the rental vehicle account and theyâve assured me that theyâll have the estimates to you by the close of business today. Also, I spoke with Marge in payables, and she asked if we could call a department-wide meeting.â

, Including your boss in opportunities and initiatives is an all-around great idea. Sharing opportunities lets your boss know that youâre a team player, and that you wonât exclude them. Collaboration and sharing also generates twice the good ideas.Sharing opportunities also gives your boss more reason to trust you and should make you feel like less of a threat.
Let your boss know, âHey! The CEO sent me a message to follow up on my presentation yesterday and asked that I create a longer presentation for the upcoming regional meeting. I told him that Iâd talk with you and that weâd work on it right away.â

, Thriving under an insecure boss can be very tough. You have best chances if you can link your success directly to your boss's. Make them realize that your successes would not be possible without their able guidance and leadership. Also highlight that your career progress will glorify him as a boss.This is different than giving your boss credit for work that youâve done. Linking your success simply means that you publicly and privately acknowledge that your boss had some part in facilitating your achievements.
âThank you, Sir. Because you hired me, you gave me an opportunity to establish myself in the field. Now that Iâm accepting another opportunity, I want to let you know that my growth wouldnât have been possible without your guidance, tutelage, and leadership.â

, If your boss is a micromanager, then checking with them before you start on a task may help to prevent your boss from criticizing you later. Seeking guidance from your boss may also fulfill their need to feel noticed and competent.


Try saying something like, âHey Mrs. Smith, do you have a minute? I want to make sure that I am doing this the right way, so I was hoping you could give me some advice.â

Focus on your bossâs positive qualities.,
Abandon ideas of making your boss feel more secure.,
Donât engage in office gossip.,
Seek support from loved ones outside of work.Make sure that you talk with caring friends and family members about what you have been dealing with at work.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Deal With an Insecure Boss3," Your boss is insecure and making your work life uncomfortable, but your boss does have lessons to teach you. Focusing on your bossâs strengths has two benefits: it shows you behaviors and skills that you can emulate in the workplace, and it gives you an opportunity to compliment your boss and boost their ego.Boosting your bossâs ego should help them overcome some of their workplace insecurity.
âMs. Cantor, you have such a talent for seeing the larger picture and envisioning potential pitfalls. Iâm really learning so much from you.â

, Your bossâs insecurity has nothing to do with you because itâs an internal conflict. Because of that, thereâs nothing you can do to fix the problem and make them feel better or more secure. Instead of focusing your energies on making your boss feel better about his or herself, do your job well and with transparency, which should help them feel more comfortable., Itâs a good idea to stay away from office gossip and people with negative attitudes in the workplace. If you fraternize with the negative folks and the gossipers, youâll ultimately be associated as one of them, even if you do nothing more than listen. This crowd certainly bothers your insecure boss the most, and you want to avoid being associated with them.If coworkers approach you with gossip or persistent complaints about the workplace, your best course of action is to consistently redirect them to another topic of conversation.
If they persist, tell them that youâre not comfortable with that topic. You can say, âJane, I really like your company and respect you as a coworker. Iâd like it if we donât discuss office politics, though, and focus instead on this exciting new project that we have.â

, This can help you to process the situation and you may even feel better just from talking about what is going on.


Try meeting a friend for coffee over the weekend or on your day off.
Call up a parent, sibling, or other caring relative and ask if you can talk with them about something that has been happening at work.

, Workplace frustration can take a toll on your overall well-being, so make sure that you are making plenty of time for self-care.You can do this by remembering to eat healthy, exercise, get plenty of rest, and making time for your hobbies.


Avoid using alcohol, drugs, or other unhealthy substances to cope with how you are feeling.
Try doing something special for yourself now and then as well, such as getting a massage or buying yourself a new book.

However, donât try to organize it now. First you need to create a clear space.Remove everything from your desk, even if you think it will stay there. This includes pictures, plants, and your computer.;
, Something becomes trash as soon as you donât need it anymore. You may think that you need to save something, but be sure before you do. If youâre not sure, you can place it in a bin or drawer for things that youâre not sure if youâll need.Shred any sensitive documents before disposing of them.
Recycle paper, plastic, and anything else that is recyclable.
People who are extremely organized with clean desks have a saying: âWhen in doubt, throw it out.â

, Even if you think the things at your desk are pretty clean, it doesnât hurt to give everything a once over. Clean your computer screen, dust all of the surfaces, dump out and wipe down desk drawers.You can use compressed air to clean your keyboard or any other objects with difficult to reach areas.
You can use a solution of water and white vinegar to clean many surfaces or purchase a cleaning agent that you like.
Surfaces include the top of your desk, the inside of your drawers, the tops of shelves, and any screens.

, You may want to build shelves into the wall or buy them. You may want them right above your desk or on the other side of the room. This usually depends on where your desk is and what you use it for.If your desk is in a cubicle at work, you may need to setup some small shelves above or next to your desk.
If your desk is in a home office or bedroom, you may want your shelves away from your desk so that theyâre out of sight and donât pose a visual distraction.
Think about what will go on the shelves before you install them. Make sure theyâre the right size for the books or tools you plan to put on them.

, By labeling shelves and drawers, you are telling yourself what goes in each place. This is key for staying organized. You can make your own labels with masking tape or stickers, or you can buy more decorative labels if you prefer.Make sure every label is clear and specific. That way, no drawer will simply become a âjunk drawer.â
If you like, you can use a color coding system instead of writing the words on each drawer.
Be careful with labels. Don't generalize to much or you can end up having messy drawers full of miscellaneous items. This can also cause confusion when it's time to put something away.

, You know the things that you use at your desk the most often. Keep those things close by and easy to get to. For example, if you have a few vertical drawers under your desk, the top one should contain the things youâll reach for most frequently. Alternately, you can keep crucial items on shelves that are visible and easily within reach.You can choose a few important things that get to sit on top of your desk. These can include current projects or tools you reference repeatedly, such as a ruler or calculator.

, This is key for not having trash pile up around your desk. Your trashcan should be reachable without getting up from your desk. That way, thereâs no danger of leaving a piece of trash on your desk to clutter it up., Now you have a clean desk and a large pile of things that came off of it. Begin going through the pile from the top down. Donât skip over anything.As you sort, remove junk and trash. Separate important things that will eventually go on shelves on in drawers.Do whatever needs to be done with each object immediately, if you can. If a paper needs to be shredded, or a knick-knack needs to be dusted, do it now. Donât wait until later.
If it will take more than two minutes to deal with an object (for example, if the paper shredder is in another building, or youâd need to go buy a duster) place the object on your âto doâ list.
Objects that will go back on the desk can go into a new pile. Objects that are trash go in the trash. Objects the youâre not sure about can go in a third pile.

, Take the pile of objects that aren't trash but that don't belong on your desk and put them in a bin or a drawer. Store that container in a basement, a closet, or somewhere else.


After a month, six months, or a year, you can go through that container. If you haven't used something from it, throw it away. The chances that you'll ever use it are very slim.

, Take each object from the first pile and place it on your desk or on a shelf. Use the labels youâve created or use another organizational system. Put each item back on the desk, one thing at a time.Try to avoid having a lot of visual distraction at your desk. Limit the amount of decoration at your desk so that you can still focus.
Books are best kept off your desk if possible. Have an accessible shelf where you can keep the books you need regularly., The more frequently you clean your desk, the easier it will be each time. At the end of each day, look at your desk and tidy it up. Throw away any trash and file away any stray papers or pieces of a project.By cleaning your desk off at the end of each workday, you ensure that youâll come into a clean and usable workplace the next day.
Designate one day per week or month to really clean your desk thoroughly, depending on how quickly it gets messy or disorganized.

, Everyone has a different way of organizing their desk and their tools. Yours will depend on the kind of work you do at your desk. Make sure that whatever you do, it keeps the space usable and clear of distractions.You might want to use different kinds of containers for different items.
You might need file folders or a bulletin board to pin things to.
You may have lots of tools that need to be hung on hooks.

, If you mostly use your desk for office work, don't keep your craft supplies there. Choose a different place in your room or office to keep those things.


If you have noticed that a certain item rarely or never gets used, don't keep it at your desk.
If there's a tool or resource that you use a lot but have been keeping elsewhere, create a space for it at your desk.

, If you've been having a hard time staying organized or keeping your desk clean, this could be a sign that you need to create a different organizational method. If you've kept everything in drawers, maybe shelves or hooks would be better for you. If you have a hard time focusing on your computer screen, maybe you need to clear everything else out of sight.


Ask other people who work in your field how they organize their desks. They might have valuable insights for you!

Understand what you're building.,

List the parts in your assembly.,
Assign part numbers to each item in your assembly.,
Make sure each of the part numbers you will use has some specification, such as a drawing or data sheet, to allow it to be purchased or fabricated.,
Assign item numbers.,
List exact quantities of each item on your BOM.,
A BOM can have multiple levels.,

Include reference designators if appropriate.,Make sure the BOM corresponds exactly to the assembly documentation, whether that is an assembly drawing, schematic, or other document.,
Include the assembly documentation or a link to it in the bill of materials.",How to Compile a Bill of Materials," You can start to compile a BOM as you go during the early phases of a design, especially if some parts will take a very long time to procure. You will complete the bill of materials as the design and documentation becomes more certain.
, Be thorough and complete, even if it seems obvious what goes in or you find the job boring., If your company keeps a database of part numbers, try to reuse standard parts such as fasteners, connectors, electrical components and other small, purchased items. Avoid creating multiple part numbers for the same part., Often these specifications will be loaded in a database so that they are associated with the part numbers they describe., Many database programs require you to assign numbers to the items in a BOM, or they may assign item numbers for you.

The item number may also be referred to as BOM ID, and should be a unique identifier.
If there is an assembly drawing, the item numbers on it should match the item numbers in the database.

, Be sure the quantity is consistent with the unit of measure in which an item is purchased (each, inch, feet, meters, ounces, etc.)

Some systems allow things to be listed as ""bulk items."" Examples of bulk items are things like adhesive or thermal compound. Bulk items might specify ""as required"" for the quantity.

, The levels represent sub-assemblies inside of higher level assemblies.

When creating multiple levels in your BOM, be sure to do so in a way consistent with your company's conventions.
Consider the manufacturing process and purchasing process when deciding what is a subassembly. Is the subassembly going to be purchased or handled as a unit? What level of assembly needs to be purchased? What needs to be sold? Are multiple suppliers involved, and if so, what items come from whom?

, The L201 alongside the component in this photo is an example of a reference designator.

Reference designators are used mostly for components on circuit boards, but may occasionally be used for valve manifolds and other similar assemblies. Not all assemblies need reference designators.

,, How this happens, exactly, should depend on your database and document control system. It may show as an attachment to the assembly, or you may add a document to the assembly BOM."

Select your copy paper.,
Ask around.,
Choose paper with a high brightness.",How to Make Great Photocopies2," Start by determining what weight paper you would like to use.


Standard weight is the most economical and works well with high-speed copiers.
Mid weight paper can be used in copiers and inkjet or laser printers. Itâs slightly heavier so itâs good for double-sided copies.
Heavy weight paper has a smooth finish. Due to its weight, however, it may slow down or jam a copy machine. Printing the original on heavy weight paper with an inkjet or laser printer can improve copy clarity., Donât be afraid to inquire at paper supply companies. If you are within an office try to get an idea of what paper has worked well in the past.


If youâre limited in your office paper choice ask about the best photocopying method for your machine. Approach someone youâve noticed using the machine and see if they have any advice for you.

, This will give the copy a higher contrast, which will make it easier to read. Brightness ranges anywhere from 84 to over 100. Choose a brightness on the high end of the spectrum.


Remember that copies print best from a white or light pastel colored original, no matter what color copy you wish to make. Deep color originals will copy gray and may be unreadable.
Choose acid free paper. Most paper is acid free but it doesn't hurt to check the label."
"
Press the âStartâ button.,
Stack your copy sheets.,
Place blank sheets in the paper tray.",How to Make Great Photocopies3," This will turn the machine on. It is usually a large, green button. It may read âStartâ or it may not have text on it. Allow the machine to warm up.


Take this time to locate the âStopâ or âCancelâ button for future reference. This button is usually red.
Some copiers have a power saving mode. This enables the machine to stay on without wasting too much energy. If the machine is in power saving mode, pressing the âStartâ button should wake it up.

, Arrange them on top of each other. Pick them up and align them using two hands, holding the stack as you would a sandwich. Make sure there are sheets out of line or folded edges.

, The machine will pull your standard or mid weight sheets from the paper tray (or feed) in order to make the copies. It is usually a drawer located near the bottom of the machine. Keeping the sheets in order, gently place them on the tray. "
"
Choose your photocopy feature.,
Adjust contrast.,
Select lightness or darkness.,
Do a test copy.,
Select quantity.",How to Make Great Photocopies4," This may depend on whether the machine has both a copy glass and an automatic document feeder. These features depend on the copy machine you are using. Copy glass gives you more control over your copies. Place the original face down and match it to the arrows or margins around the glass for proper alignment. The machine should recognize when an original has been placed on the glass. With the glass it is easier to center your original and you have the option to zoom.


To zoom in on an original, jot down the measurements of the image you wish to enlarge, visible at the perimeter of the glass. Decide how large you want the image to become. This is your target dimension. Remember not to choose a target dimension larger than the paper size. Divide the target dimension width by the actual image size width and multiply this by 100. You can use height instead if you wish. The result is the enlargement percentage. It is the number you will enter into the menu under the enlargement or zoom option.The automatic document feeder is a feature on most copy machines no matter their size. While it gives you less control over your results, it is useful when you have multiple pages to copy. Simply slide the originals in order into the feeder tray.

, Contrast will make text and images stand out from the background. This will make copies clearer and easier to read. On most copiers you select the contrast option from the menu. One you have selected contrast, use the scale on the screen or the arrows on the keyboard to indicate higher or lower contrast., There should be a scale on the screen or arrows on the keypad to indicate this. Newsprint, color to black and white, or photos will need to be lightened. Light text, light colors, or pencil drawings need to be darkened to show up well.

, Enter 1 under quantity and examine the result. If you are satisfied you can proceed with a higher quantity.This is especially important when trying the contrast or zoom features for the first time. It is also easy to misalign a copy on the glass. Keep adjusting until the copies are as clear and centered as possible.


Adjust settings in the machine if your copy is not how you like it. Pages that have been ripped out of a notebook (torn edges) can be moved over or there may be a margin shift button on the machine to make a better copy.
If paper has become jammed, the machine will show you the location of the jam and may have steps for you to follow to clear the trapped page and continue.
An error message means the copier does not have enough information to start copying. Make sure you entered copy quantity and color.

, Use the keypad or screen to enter the number of copies you need.


Once you have entered your quantity, press the large copy button. If something goes wrong, press the red âStopâ or âCancelâ button. It may take the machine a few seconds to stop.

Get a job at a restaurant.,
Practice cooking at home and be prepared to replicate your skills at work.,
Have a passion for the culinary arts field.,
Enroll in a culinary arts program.,
Find an internship.,
Get certified.,
Apply for jobs.,
Understand you are going to start at the bottom.,
Stay at the top of your field.",How to Become a Chef," You'll be exposed to an environment that you're choosing to embark upon. Learn from the Chefs there by showing enthusiasm as to what they're doing.


Your first restaurant job doesn't have to be prestigious. And it won't be. You'll start as a kitchen hand as you claw your way to higher ranks and more prestige.;
, When you cook at home, you're going at your own pace. At work you have to adjust your speed to the circumstances. You are essentially producing a set amount of output in an efficient amount of time. This is done during Prep where you are producing the ground work for a smooth service. In service you'll be cranking out high quality dishes to crowds of people. .


Become confident with a knife and other kitchen equipment. Be confident with your tools but be prepared for the many cuts to come. It is a rite of passage to becoming a chef.
Learn everything about the food you love. When you're a chef, food is no longer just what you eat. Food is what you speak, food is your lover and is the epitome of who you are.
As you practice at home, think about what type of cooking best suits you. Do you see yourself working with a particular type of cuisine? Do you enjoy making desserts more than main courses? Your interests will determine where you seek education and experience down the line.
Practice cooking for other people. Chefs are under a lot of pressure to perform well. If people's expectations aren't met, they send dishes back and write negative reviews. Find out early whether you'll be able to hold up under close scrutiny of your work.

, Not just anyone can be a chef. It takes dedication to becoming an expert on how to cook, but also an obsession with new flavors and trends and an awareness of your competition.


Visit good restaurants to get a sense of how they are run. If you can, pay attention to the roles the staff are playing, and how they work together to make the restaurant run smoothly.
Read restaurant reviews, cooking magazines, profiles of head cooks and chefs, and other literature related to culinary arts. Gain a deep understanding of the field you are entering. Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential, The Professional Chef from the Culinary Institute of America, and Becoming a Chef by Dornenburg and Page are all great resources.

, Going to cooking school isn't a prerequisite for becoming a chef, but it can give you a leg up when it comes to getting hired at good restaurants.


Programs are offered at trade or vocational schools, colleges and culinary institutes.
Most programs offer a broad education in nutrition, sanitary food preparation techniques, butchery, pastry making, and other basic cooking knowledge.
If you plan to eventually start your own restaurant, find a program that offers classes in business, management, human resources, and other areas of knowledge that will come into play.

, Some culinary arts programs have relationships with local restaurants and offer internship positions to students. If you have this opportunity, take it. You'll continue learning new techniques and skills while also acquiring experience you can put on your resume.


If your program does not offer internships, pursue one yourself. Talk with the head cook or chef at your favorite restaurant and ask if he or she would be willing to let you help out and ask questions.

, The American Culinary Federation (ACF) offers a generalized certification as well as certifications in specialized areas, like pastry making. A certification from the ACF will help differentiate you from other candidates trying for the same job.

, Now that you have years of education and experience under your belt, find a job as part of the kitchen staff at a restaurant that appeals to you.


If possible, use some of the connections you made through your culinary program and internship. If you've already worked with people before, you may be able to move up toward chef status more quickly.
In Europe, the interview process involves working at the restaurant for a day for free. You see what their staff can do, they see what you can do, and if it's a good match, you're hired.

, There is no such thing as graduating cookery school and buying your way to Head Chef, that mentality doesn't exist because a Chef is an individual who learns through experience and has to be tested to climb the ranks to a position of power. These tests come in the form of cuts, burns and guided by the Chefs that came before them.


People who do well with scut work are promoted to garde manger, and are in charge of preparing appetizers, soups, and cold dishes.
The next step up is to become a line cook, working directly with entrees.
Talented people are promoted to sous chef, the head chef's second in command.
Finally, an executive chef manages the entire kitchen, and sometimes owns the restaurant. This level is achieved after years of hard work.

, As you're climbing the ladder, keep yourself abreast of the latest food trends. Eat at excellent restaurants, get to know other people in the business, and keep your culinary skills sharp. Start thinking creatively and with an eye toward what ensures the success of a restaurant. When the time is right, you'll be promoted to executive chef, or you'll have the knowledge and skills to branch off on your own.

Set your fax machine up.,
Adjust your settings.,
Gather your documents.,
Place your documents in the machine.,
Enter the fax number.,
Press the send button.,
Look for a confirmation message.",How to Fax1," In order to send and receive faxes using a fax machine, you will need to make sure that your fax machine is plugged in and connected to your landline phone connection.A dedicated line is recommended if you plan on faxing frequently because you will not be able to use the fax machine and the phone at the same time.
You should also make sure your fax machine has toner and paper if you plan on receiving faxes.
If you don't have a fax machine at home or at work, you may be able to send one for free from your local public library. You can also go to a store such as Kinko's or The UPS Store to fax your documents for a fee. These options work best if you do not expect to send faxes frequently.;
, All fax machines are different, but you will usually have the option to adjust certain settings. Read your user manual in order to learn more about the specific features that are available on your machine.If you want to know for sure that your fax was transmitted successfully, turn the confirmation page setting on. When this feature is turned on, the machine will print a page after you send a fax, which will let you know if it was successfully transmitted or not.
You can also set up a fax header, which is a line of text that will appear at the top of each document you send. It typically includes basic information about who the fax is from.
If you plan on receiving faxes as well, you can choose between automatic receive mode or manual receive mode, which will require you to accept each incoming fax.

, Using the original documents instead of photocopies will provide the recipient with a document that is cleaner and easier to read.


Use a cover sheet on top of the pages you will fax. The cover sheet should contain information such as the sender's name and fax number, the recipient's name and fax number, the date, and the number of pages included in the fax.

, Many machines have both a paper feeder and a flatbed screen. If you have only one page, you can use either function. If you have multiple pages, the paper feeder usually works better.


When using the paper feeder, you can insert all of your pages at once. Your fax machine should have an icon that indicates which direction that papers should be facing in the paper feeder. Some fax machines also offer the option to scan and fax both sides of a document, so check your user manual to see if this is possible on your machine.When using the flatbed screen, lift the lid on the top of the machine and place your document face down on the glass screen. Make sure to line your document up with the markings provided on the screen and close the lid before continuing.

, When entering the number, be sure to include the area code, country code, and any numbers that you need to dial out. You should enter the number exactly the way you would if you were calling the number using a phone., After a few seconds, you will hear the machine begin to transmit the fax and the papers will begin feeding into the fax machine.The button on your machine may say ""go"" or ""fax"" instead of ""send.""

, Some machines will display a message on the screen to let you know if your fax was successfully transmitted. If you configured your settings to receive printed confirmations, your machine will print a page that details the status of your fax."

Stay calm.",How to Be a Waiter," People come out to eat at a restaurant for more than the food. Eating out is an experience, and the wait staff is the most visible part of that experience. Can you chat up even the most dour and uncommunicative people at parties? Do you empathize with people easily? Are you quick with a joke and smile? If the answer is yes, you've got one of the necessary traits at waiting tables.


You don't have to be a stand-up comedian, but you do need to be a good communicator. Quiet servers are often just as good as talkative ones, they just need to make sure they're communicating with body language, doing their job efficiently, and listening as well as they possibly can.;
, Are you a good multitasker? Can you remember lists of things easily? Can you adapt quickly to changes and new situations? A member of the wait staff needs to be able to take orders, communicate with the back-of-house workers, and act as the ""face"" of the restaurant to the customers. It's a tall order, but it must be done quickly and efficiently for the restaurant to work properly.

, Carrying a tray of wobbly drinks and hot plates full of buffalo wings is difficult enough to do without spilling once, but after a long shift of serving rowdy football fans? It can be downright exhausting. If you're fit and healthy, being a member of the wait staff will be a much more comfortable transition. You don't have to be a bodybuilder, but it helps to be comfortable negotiating a crowded room while holding heavy objects safely and quickly.

, If the kitchen can't read your tickets, things will get messed up quickly. Keeping track of information and legibly recording your orders is a critical part of the process of the restaurant. The whole process starts with you.


At the restaurant, you'll get specific details and learn how the system works, but in general you want to be familiar with the essentials.

, The upscale bistro downtown probably doesn't hire servers without experience. If you've never worked as a server before, chain restaurants like Chili's or Applebee's are a good way to start out, getting the training and experience you'll need to get a job where the tips will be great. You'll learn a lot about the way a restaurant works and the way to be a good server.

, If you don't have one already, focus on articulating the skills necessary for serving food in a restaurant. You'll need to be good at dealing with customers, working in a team-environment, and working quickly. Highlight similar work experience that illustrates these traits.


If you've never worked before and hope to get a job as a server, you might focus on school successes and teamwork environments like sports in which you've thrived. Be positive and sell yourself. That's the job.

, When you find a place that's hiring, ask to speak with the manager. A resume left with a bartender might end up getting lost, and anyway, the bartender isn't the one doing the hiring.


Bring your resume and your enthusiasm. Tell them you'd be really excited to speak more about the position and that you're ready to start right away. Since being a server is about making a good first impression most of the time, treat getting the job like the job. Make a good first impression.

, Preparing answers to likely interview questions will ensure that you're not thrown for a loop in front of the manager and that you've thought through the responsibilities of the job.Some managers might ask, ""What's your favorite thing on our menu?"" or ""If the kitchen ran out of fish, what would suggest as an alternative?"" Brush up on the menu of the restaurant before hand by checking out Yelp or the restaurant's website.
Be prepared to respond to disaster scenarios. Some managers might ask, ""Someone gives you a fake ID to buy alcohol. What do you do?"" or, more directly, ""A customer is angry about their meal. What should you do?"" Think through these scenarios and respond thoughtfully.
Come with questions of your own. Usually, a good question like ""What does someone need to be really successful here?"" can leave an extremely good first impression on a manager. They'll often give you the chance to ask questions, which can be a missed opportunity in an interview.

, Introduce yourself and say your name clearly. ""Hello, nice to see you. My name's ___. Here is/are your menu(s). Would you like to start off with a refreshing beverage from our bar?"" Greet customers with a smile as they enter.


Maintain balanced eye-contact, but avoid staring too much. Some customers are uncomfortable and will come to the restaurant in a variety of moods. Respond appropriately. As you seat them at their table, perhaps stir up small conversation as you proceed to take their drink orders. If they're not interested in chatting, leave it at that.

, If children are present, ask for their beverages first, followed by ladies and then gentleman all following the left to right order.


This is also the time to discuss the specials and any promotional deals the restaurant is offering at this time.
When you have served their drinks, ask if they have any questions about the menu. Don't rush them unless they are late, and even then do it gently. If they are ready to order, take their order clockwise starting at the left and closest to you. If not, proceed to your next table.

, and give them a second to think about it. Check back again within five minutes with, ""Are you enjoying everything?"" Ask specifically about the host's dish: ""How is your Steak?"" Listen to their response and read their body language: many people are shy to speak up about problems, and they may blame that on you when it comes time to leave a tip.


Bring out orders in their entirety. Never bring one guest's food without the other's, unless specially instructed otherwise (this may happen if one or more in the party plans to leave early). Normally, there shouldn't be any circumstance causing one part of an order be ready much later than another. If on occasion you foresee this happening and causing a problem, briefly explain the situation and ask how the customer would prefer handling this.

, Always clear plates from the previous course completely before bringing plates from the next course to a table.


Before clearing plates, be sure to ask politely if they are ready. Use a manner and tone consistent with both the atmosphere and the customer. Generally, ""May I take this/these for you?"" is good. Don't ask if they're obviously still eating. If someone is talking and has food on their plate, don't interrupt their story to ask if they're finished. Wait and come back.

, Asking gives them the chance to order more without having to make a special request for it. They'll be more likely to order dessert if you ask.


Clear any complimentary breads and/or soup from before the main course before ordering the dessert course.

, Inform your guest that you will prepare the payment for them, making change if they've paid in cash and processing the credit card if they're using one. Never ask if they want change or assume that the change is for your tip--just break the bills and quickly return with the change/receipt.


When you return, thank them and say something like, ""It's been nice to see you"" , ""Hope to see you again soon"", OR if they seem to be lingering after their meal, just say ""thank you"", as they may need refills and such.

, Always arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled shift, well-groomed and with clean clothes on. Wear clean shoes and socks. Your hair should be neat and washed, your nails clean, your uniform/clothes clean and modest. Apply limited quantities of makeup to show a natural & fresh look.

, If a table wants something they will glance around to look for you. Learn to stay alert as you walk the floor, without staring at your tables. Most customers will make eye contact as a signal that they need you. This can give them the feeling like you're paying attention without hovering over them.


When their good food and conversation is over, they will start looking around at other diners or the walls. This can tell you when to clear plates, offer desserts or drop the check.

, Avoid going into eagle-hawk mode and badgering the customers. Customers hate to be ogled at or constantly interrupted in their conversation and meal, but will also need something every now and then. It's a delicate balance.


Learn to gauge your customers quickly. If a couple seems tense and like they might be in the middle of an argument, it's probably not the time to ask ""Celebrating something tonight?"" or other breaking-the-ice questions. If a table seems like they're having a good time and are hesitant to leave, suggest drinks or coffee. If they feel like chatting, take a moment to chat. If not, leave them in their conversation.

, If it becomes directly known to you during their visit which guest will be paying, you may leave the check at the end of the table by him or her. Otherwise, leave the check in the middle of the table. Check is always face down. If it is inside a check envelope, lay it flat on the table.

, When customers get nasty or rude, listen and communicate with them openly. Remember: it's a job, it isn't personal. If they're openly belligerent, disturbing other customers, or overtly drunk, grab the manager and let the boss deal with it.

,Â This allows you to know when a new table arrives and you can immediately pour the waters and bring the bread.Â  You can then also go into the kitchen and tell them 'two top!'(this means two customers at a table, four customers would be a 'four top').Â  The chefs like to keep a count on how many people they will be cooking for, and helping them earns you points in the kitchen.

,Â  It is important to ask every ten minutes or so if she/he needs anything.Â  But do not bother the waitress/waiter.Â  Read their faces, if they make eye contact, casually ask if they need anything or if you could get someone's drinks for them.Â  Even if they don't need you, they like knowing that you are eager to help.

,Â  Make sure that if there are cleared dishes sitting in front of people that you take them and put them in the bus pan.Â  If people need more water, pour it.Â  Scan the room for faces that may be asking you for something.Â  Often people ask bussers for things that their waiters have forgotten, be ready.

,Â  Polish silverware, restock napkins and glasses, refill the ice machine.Â  There are different things in each restaurant that can be done when work is slow; do them.Â  Perfect them.Â If you have no free time, make sure they get done at the beginning of your shift or at the end when things are slowest.Â  Don't give anyone a reason to complain about you.

,Â  After all the rounds are made and all of the sidework is done, relax.Â  When everyone is hanging out in the kitchen cracking jokes, join them.Â  Be part of the team, but earn it.

Keep track of each station.,
Be aware as guests approach the restaurant.,
Greet them with a smile and welcome them to the restaurant .,
Find out how many people are dining.,
After greeting the guests, look at the SIZE of the largest member of the party and assign the seating with that in mind.,
When figuring out where to seat them, rotate the stations.,
When the guest sits down, place a menu for each of them by the place setting, or hand the menu to the guest.,
Maintain supplies!,
Make sure that there are complete place settings for each guest and that the table is clean.,
Be prepared to get some things for guests, water refills, utensils, napkins, or carryout boxes.,
Walk the floor!,
Help to clear and set tables when necessary.",How to Be a Great Host or Hostess in a Restaurant," Make a chart of each server's station, and what tables are in it (also learn the table layout by heart). Review all reservations for your shift, and assign suitable tables for each. Keep note of how many people are in a party, what time they arrived, and what table they are at. Also keep note of who is still there so that servers do not become overwhelmed.;
, If you are busy with another guest, acknowledge the guest by saying, ""I will be right with you,"" make eye contact, or a simple hand gesture also works.

, Remember, you are the first and last chance for the restaurant to make a good impression, and set them at ease.

, If there is a wait make sure to get everyone's name in right away so they do not feel ignored. Guests will normally ask for a time frame. Never try to give a specific time. Tell them an 'estimated' time. Look at the wait list and add 5 minutes for each party of the same size. If 6 parties of 2 are on the list, the estimated wait time would be 30 minutes for another party of 2. Guests are generally impatient, and will find somewhere else to dine.

, DON'T put them in a small booth! Also, a guest that has trouble walking should be given a seat as close to the hostess station as possible.

, Distribute the tables evenly among the servers. But also keep in mind how many large parties they have or have had. Try not to seat any two parties too close together when it is not necessary.

, Don't just throw menus on the table and leave without saying anything.

, If we are running low on any forms, highlighters, etc. ask the manager for the supplies you will need. (This should be done before the lunch or dinner rush.)

, If not, get the napkins/silverware, or give the table a quick wipe down with a damp rag. If it is beyond that, seat them somewhere else and make sure the mess is dealt with.

, If a guest does ask for something else, inform the guest that you will let their server know .

, The only way to know the progression of tables is to see how many tables are on dessert, if they have paid their check, etc. If you need tables, let the servers know and see if they can expedite their meal. You are on the same team.

, If there are customers waiting for tables, the more hands helping to make that happen, the better.

, ""How about some nachos or homemade chips and queso to get you going?"" I can't tell you how many people overlook the appetizer portion of the menu.

, Make sure you bring enough plates for every guest. Make sure to put appropriate condiments on the table when necessary.

, Ask the table if they need anymore time to look at the menu or if they're ready to order. The order may have different substitutions so always remember to neatly write down the order and make sure you repeat it back to them. Make sure to get the children's food out first. If two people are splitting a meal together, make sure you let the kitchen know you would like that split on two separate plates. It may seem basic but little things like that go a long way with guests.

, Make sure none of their glasses gets less then halfway empty at any time of their meal.

, Once you've dropped off the appetizer, make sure to check back within either two minutes or two bites. This shows the table you care about how their food came out.

, Make sure you ask your guests if their plate is finished. Even if its obviously clear to you. Make sure to also clear any condiments that may have been placed on the table with their appetizer.

, Just like with the appetizer, make sure you bring out the appropriate condiments for their meal.

, With the exception of the children's food, make sure the other guests get their food at the same time.

, Just like with the appetizer, make sure you also check back and see how their entrÃ©e came out.

, Make sure you ask your guests if their plate is finished. Even if its obviously clear to you. Make sure to also clear any condiments that may have been placed on the table with their meal.

, Suggest your favorite or one of the most popular.

, Always bring it to them and say ""No rush I'm ready when you are.""

, Always thank the table for coming and offer them to come back. They could have easily cooked at home or gone to another restaurant.

While butlers have traditionally been male, nowadays, women are also pursuing careers in this field.
As of 2013, the average salary for most butlers in the United States is between $50,000 and $120,000 annually. Note, however, that your salary may be lower if you are accepting the position at an entry level.
Nowadays, most butlers take a managerial role in household operations. You'll need to be a master at a range of household related skills.
You should be physically strong and healthy. Since the operation of the household rests on your shoulders, you will need to be physically and mentally capable of handling the task without frequent breaks or vacations.
Private butlers usually live in an apartment or room of the main house or in a separate small house elsewhere on the estate. As such, you can expect to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.;
, Beyond a high school diploma or GED, you don't need any formal education to become a butler. Most potential employers will want to see that you have completed high school, though.


During high school, consider taking classes that could help in on your job path. For instance, take courses in home economics and finance.

, While there are no formal education requirements, you will need to know the right skills if you want to become a butler. You should be able to study the majority of these skills on your own.


As a butler, you may need to supervise other household staff, hire other household staff, arrange and care for the client's wardrobe, take on the role of household secretary, keep a family schedule, serve meals and drinks, arrange tables, receive guests, and maintain the security of the household.Consider taking supplementary classes on finance, security, food preparation, and etiquette. Basic computer knowledge can also give you the knowledge you need to keep track of family finances, and schedules.

, Even though formal education is not required, there are post-secondary schools and academies that do offer brief training courses in the field. Going through these training courses will polish your skills, and many of these academies also have job placement services.


You can look for household management courses at a technical school or community college, or you could go to a school that specializes in the field. Several notable specialty schools include:

School for Butlers and Hospitality (Brussels, Belgium)
The Professional Domestic Institute (Powell, Ohio, USA)
The Estate Management Studies program at the French Culinary Institute (New York City, New York, USA)
The Charles MacPherson Academy (Toronto, Ontario)
The International Butler Academy (Valkenburg Van de Geul, The Netherlands)


A formal training program will teach you the code of ethics practiced by butlers, as well as the skill sets used by those in the field. You can expect to take classes on professional presentation, table service, routine home maintenance, laundry essentials, and household cleaning/organizing., Find a professional butler and inquire about the possibility of doing an apprenticeship with him or her. Being able to observe a professional on the job will help you gain perspective on how to improve your own performance.


You may not get paid for the experience and the job shadowing period may only last for a few weeks. During this time, observe the professional's actions as much as possible. When given tasks, complete them as your experience and knowledge suggest.

, While butlers and maids perform different tasks, some of the tasks can overlap. Consider spending time working for clients through a maid agency.


Instead of looking for work as an independent maid or house cleaner, try to find employment with formal maid and house cleaning services. Search for local house cleaning agencies in your area and find out how to apply.
Focus on work that will give you experience as a house cleaner. Working as a maid at a hotel is also a legitimate option. Avoid janitorial positions within industrial companies, however, since the skills you will use there will not offer you much usable work experience for a career as a butler.

, There are a variety of positions at a hotel that will allow you to use and fine-tune your butler skills. In addition to improving your skills, you will also benefit from being able to show this work experience on a resume.


Working as a concierge will give you experience greeting guests and minding accommodations.
If you cannot get a position at the desk, aim for a job as a porter or maid. While these jobs are only loosely related to the tasks a butler will perform, they will still give you valuable experience and instruct you on tending to clients' needs.

, A butler can perform many services, and you can gain experience in these various services by working within the service or hospitality industry.


Work as a host or server at a restaurant to gain experience setting tables, serving drinks, and serving meals.
Consider working at a dry cleaners to gain knowledge about caring for wardrobes.
Take a job as a secretary or receptionist in an office to prepare yourself for secretarial work that may be expected of a household butler.
Spend time as a hired driver so that you can gain chauffeur experience. While chauffeurs and butlers are usually two separate people within a household, there are instances when a butler also doubles as a private driver.

, Joining a professional guild or organization for butlers and household staff is extremely advantageous since you will have some sort of âformalâ backing. Potential employers looking to hire a private butler often turn to these organizations with their requests before turning to the public.


One of the largest organizations you can join is the International Guild of Professional Butlers (http://www.butlersguild.com/). You will need to register with the guild and send in your resume. After that, you will have access to their list of current jobs, as well as other resources.
Just as there are agencies that hire and place maids, there are also agencies that hire and place butlers. These are less common, especially in the United States, so tracking one down in your area can be difficult. If you cannot find one in your local yellow pages or online, consult your nearest maid / house cleaner agency or other contacts you have made within the hospitality industry to find out where the nearest butler organization or agency might be.

, Turn to the classifieds. Nowadays, legitimate butler positions are rare, and it is even rarer to find an advertisement for such a position in the newspaper or online classifieds. Nonetheless, they are posted from time to time, so persistently looking in the classifieds can pay off.


Larger cities have more opportunities in the field, especially if there are wealthy neighborhoods in that city. Focus on looking through the classifieds for those areas first.
Be careful when answering job ads. Since butler positions are rare, many ads you run across may actually be scams and have the potential to be dangerous. Avoid meeting potential employers in deserted areas, and if your intuition tells you to leave, listen to it.

, As you gain experience in other parts of the service and hospitality industry, you will naturally begin networking with professionals. If you make a good impression on the people you work with as you gain experience, someone may eventually be able to recommend you to a private employer.


Keep a list of potentially helpful contacts with each job experience you complete. You can ask these contacts to guide you to any positions they know about, or if you find a butler position on your own, you can ask these people to vouch for your skills and work ethic.

Always look presentable.,
Know the menu thoroughly.,
Suggest additional purchases.,
Multitask.,
Manage your time well.,
Check the food before bringing it to the customer.,
Anticipate common requests.,
Don't let a bad tip ruin your shift.,
Never sit around doing nothing.",How to Be a Great Waitress1," If you wear a uniform, make sure to keep it in excellent condition - ironed, stain-free and neat. If there is no uniform, wear well kept, slightly formal clothing. This gives the customers a better first impression and will keep your boss happy. Check your appearance periodically to see if you look disheveled or have spilled something on yourself without noticing.


Keep your nails clean and tidily cut.
Wear nice looking shoes, not tennis shoes, and keep them tightly tied. Never wear sandals.
Refrain from wearing perfume or cologne as some guests may have allergies to these scents. Similarly, try not to smoke before work or during your break, as it can leave an obnoxious smell.
Keep jewelry and makeup subtle and unobtrusive.;
, Being familiar with every item on the menu will save you a lot of time and trouble when taking orders. Study the menu on your own time if necessary to avoid mistakes and slow orders.


Become familiar with every option for every order. If a customer orders a sandwich, you should know which breads are available, which sides come with the sandwich, and how to phrase these questions clearly.
Know which dishes contain meat, dairy, and common allergens, such as peanuts. Be ready to suggest similar alternatives for customers who cannot eat those ingredients.
Familiarize yourself with the daily specials before each work shift.

, Politely ask whether the customer would like a drink, a side, or an upgrade to their order. Management will love you for this and your tips will increase as your customers purchase more.


Know which liquors are expensive and high quality. Suggest their use when a customer requests a mixed drink.
Always ask if the table would like an appetizer.
Never be pushy or deceptive. Present the option to the customer politely, and don't try to pass off an upgrade as though it were free.

, You'll have a much easier shift if you can accomplish three tasks in one trip to the kitchen and back. Take empty dishes from tables whenever you're on your way to the kitchen. Fill up a tray when several tables want condiments, drinks, or similar items instead of carrying them out one by one.Unless you are an experienced waitress who can confidently remember every task, write your orders down immediately and make additional notes if you need to remember to do something in five or ten minutes.

, Keep track of how long its been since you checked on each table, and become familiar with how long each meal takes to cook. Plan to visit each table after they've finished each course. Move briskly without running and try to maintain a steady pace to keep everything running smoothly.Pass on your knowledge of waiting times to the customer. If someone orders a well done steak, let them know it will take longer. If a soup just ran out and the cook needs to make a new one, let the customer know how long that will take and suggest an alternative.

, Especially when there are special requests involved, you can save everyone a lot of headache by making sure the order is correct before bringing it to the table.


If an order has been messed up, let the kitchen and the customers know. Apologize for the additional delay and, if allowed in your restaurant, try to give them a discounted meal or something extra to make up for it.

, Most customers want ketchup with their burger. Kids frequently drop their silverware. Once you get to know which requests are popular with which meals and customers, bring them to the table in advance. This saves both you and the customers time and makes them feel taken care of.


Extra silverware, condiment packets, and napkins can be kept in your apron pocket if you have one.

, Never complain to a table about a bad tip, no matter how great your service was. Not only could you get yourself fired but it sets you up as the complaining type and creates bad relations with the other waiting staff.


Some people never tip appropriately regardless of service. Others may not be able to afford the tip, or may be visiting from a country where tipping is not common practice.

, If you have no customers to take care of, clean! There's always work to be done in a restaurant. Show your employer that you're able to take initiative and work hard.


If your current tables do not require attention, look at the other customers as well. Some of them may be trying to flag down a waitress for a small request that you can fill without stepping on the toes of their waitstaff.

Pay attention to the parents when the kids are ordering.,
Don't set dangerous objects near children.,
Make the dining experience as fast as possible for parents with babies.,
Stay neutral in arguments over who will pay.,
Understand how to serve tea and coffee.,
Ask diners if they would like water when they order caffeine or alcohol.,
Never put an object from the floor back on the table.,
Practice specialized tasks on your own time.,
Choose appropriate music and vary the selection.",How to Be a Great Waitress2," A kid might try to order an unhealthy meal, caffeinated beverage, or other item parents might disapprove of. Give the parent a chance to object before you repeat the order.


If the parents aren't paying attention, repeat the order back loudly and clearly, addressing the whole table. This gives them another chance to notice.
In front of young kids, after a parent has objected, you may be able to smooth the argument away by saying ""Sorry, we're all out of soda, can I get you something else?""
If you personally disapprove of someone's choice, don't say anything. This is up for the parents to decide, unless the order clearly violates the law, such as serving a child alcohol.

, If you are serving hot dishes, putting down metal utensils, or giving the table some other potentially dangerous item, do so near the parents and address them with a ""Here you are, sir/ma'am"" if you need to get their attention.

, Babies and young toddlers typically have a short attention span, and if the meal drags on, the parents and the whole restaurant could suffer as well. Check in more frequently on them than on other tables, and multitask as much as possible to speed up the process.


Ask if you can take the drink and meal orders together instead of in two visits.
Suggest a more quickly prepared alternative if one of the customers orders a dish that will take extra long.
This is the rare situation in which you should bring the check when you approach to clear the final dishes. You should still ask if the customers are finished first.
Do not make the customers feel like you're trying to throw them out. Many tired and busy parents will appreciate your prompt service, but if they are getting annoyed, back off and let them continue the meal at their own pace.

, If multiple customers at one table request to pay, try to place the check in the center of the table instead of near one of them. Just smile and say you'll be back to collect it if they try to involve you in the argument.

, People get very serious about their tea and coffee, and it pays to know how to serve it in a way that will make most people happy. Disregard this advice when serving regulars if you know they like their drink a certain way (which you should pay attention to).


Tea drinkers are often finicky about preparation. Always be sure you know which variety of tea they ordered, and provide plenty of milk, lemon wedges, and sugar on the side so they can customize their drink.
Do not refill tea or coffee without asking the customer. You may be changing their carefully prepared beverage.
Don't place the spoon in the tea or coffee before taking it to the customer. This lowers the temperature of the drink, which some customers don't appreciate.

, This is more relevant for people eating a meal than for people at the bar. Many people like to drink water in order to counteract the dehydrating or mood-changing effects of these substances.


You may not be able to follow this rule in regions outside the United States, where serving water is less common or comes with a price tag.

, Even if it is just a paper advertisement or a salt shaker, you should replace it with a new one from the kitchen. Your customers do not want to have ""floor germs"" on their table.

, Most commonly, this involves opening a bottle of wine. Many serving tasks you find difficult can easily be practiced when you ""serve"" yourself dinner, so they don't take much extra time to learn.


Most waiters who are supposed to open wine are expected to do so in front of the customers who ordered it. Practice this task to make it seem smooth and natural.

, If you have control over the music selection, keep it at a relatively low volume and choose something appropriate to the mood. Never play a full album; mix it up so a customer who doesn't like that artist has another chance to hear something they do enjoy.


Customers at a cafe, or eating during the morning and early afternoon, usually enjoy calming, unobtrusive music. Classical music is a good choice.
Customers eating in the evening may enjoy more energetic music, but this varies greatly depending on the atmosphere of the establishment. Most still want the volume low so they can talk to their friends. In any case, waitstaff rarely make music decisions for the busiest or most formal times of day.

Introduce yourself.,
Stay polite, friendly and helpful, even to angry customers.,
Respect the customer's personal space.,
Personally advise the customer about their order.,
Accommodate any reasonable request your customers make.,
Repeat the order back to your customers.,
Check on your customers regularly and give them updates.,
Clear old dishes promptly but not without talking to the customer.,
Befriend your regulars.,
Don't assume the customer wants the check, but don't leave them waiting either.",How to Be a Great Waitress3," Make eye contact with the customers after they are seated and promptly introduce yourself. This starts the conversation out on the right foot, leading to better tips on average, and gives them a polite way to get your attention later.Multitask by introducing yourself as you pass out the menus and check that every customer has enough silverware and napkins.

, When speaking to customers, always use respectful terms of address such as sir, ma'am, and miss. Act friendly and positive, and make your customers feel as comfortable as possible.


Ask the customer whether they have dined at your restaurant before -- that way if they are new, first-time customers you can welcome them and offer your help with the menu.
Appear friendly, but do not get involved in the customer's conversation unless asked. Do your job, then leave the customer to eat or talk in relative privacy.
Always remember to smile. No matter how irritating customers or co-workers can be, just put on a pleasant face and suck it up -- this will save you a lot of drama!
Don't talk or gossip about customers even when you think they can't hear you. Remain polite and respectful when discussing them in case they are in earshot.

, Never sit down at the table to take an order. Don't shake hands or hug unless you are personal friends with the customer, or you are shaking hands to greet them as per restaurant policy. Other physical interactions depend on the atmosphere of the place you work, and whether you are a man or woman.


Studies of U.S. restaurants show that women who touch a customer lightly on the shoulder, hand, or arm receive better tips from that customer on average.This should only be done when the customer appears relaxed and comfortable, and never if the customer is on a date with a woman. Be friendly rather than flirtatious.

, If a customer asks for advice, be prepared to answer whatever questions they have or recommend your favorite dish in each category. If a customer orders a dish that gets a lot of complaints, try to recommend another option.


Customers like it when you give them the ""inside scoop"", but you shouldn't go so far as to insult a dish unless you work in an unusually relaxed environment. Instead, steer them away from a bad dish by recommending a similar, better option as ""the chef's specialty"" or ""my personal favorite"".

, Many people have serious reasons to avoid certain ingredients, including potentially fatal allergies. If you aren't familiar with every dish on the menu (which you should be), do your best to find out for them how it is prepared.


Never lie to a customer and give them an ingredient they requested to have removed. If you can't accommodate the request, simply say so and suggest a similar alternative that the customer can eat.
Don't question your customers. Keep in mind there are many reasons for menu change requests, such as religious, vegetarian/vegan and cultural dietary restrictions. If the request can be accommodated, don't ask why they made it!

, Studies of U.S. establishments show that waitstaff who repeat the order to the customers receive more tips.However big or small that effect might be, it also gives the customer a chance to correct any mistakes or change their mind.

, If you just got a job as a waiter or waitress, it may take some time to get a feel for how frequently you should check on each table. At least check in whenever they are finishing a course or if they look bored or irritated while waiting for their food.


Give them a specific time estimate if they ask how long the food will take, whenever possible.
Stop by to refill your customers' glass whenever it gets low, or to ask if they'd like to purchase another for non-refillable drinks.

, Always ask whether the customer is finished before removing dishes with food on them. If there is a lot of food left, ask whether the food was all right.


Many restaurants allow their waitstaff to give unsatisfied customers something extra to make up for bad experiences. This could save your tip.

, Be friendly to people you would not normally talk to. When someone sits in your section more than once, take the time to get to know them. You don't need to become fast friends, but you will probably end up getting to like at least some of them.


Remember their names and favorite drinks, where they work etc. Make them feel like they are going to a restaurant to visit a friend: you!
Try to write down the appearance and preferences of anyone who visits more than once. The customer will be impressed if you know how they like their steak on the third visit.

, Ask if there is anything more you can get for them, and that will open the opportunity for them to ask for dessert, a take-out item/bag, or the check.


If they state they need nothing else, then ask if they are ready for the check.
If they have to ask you, it generally means they are in a hurry, or you have waited an excessive amount of time since you last checked on the table.
Never ask the customer if they need change. Say ""I will be right back with your change,"" then come back and leave the full amount on the table.

Understand what it takes to be a competent server.,
Consider the customer's side of the transaction.,
Learn the five rules for servers:



Always have a smile, a genuine happy outlook shows through.",How to Be a Competent Server," Ask yourself the question ""what do we need to feel fulfilled when being served?"". In the service world, you either do your job well or you make no money.;
, As a customer, we need to feel taken care of, we are paying to be pampered. Of course, the extent of pampering is dependent on the type of restaurant, as in McDonalds may not bring you a refill on a water, whereas another style of restaurant would do this. Customers are demanding they are paying to be served at the table. It is for this reason that the server needs to be able to adjust to all situations on the go.

, What you do is your livelihood. How you conduct yourself and convey it to others pays your bills and keeps food on your table.

Anticipate what people need before they have to think about it. This may seem difficult but it is really common sense. If the glass is half full, fill it, if the plate is empty, take it away and ask what else they need. Even if you know the answer, this makes the customer feel relaxed.

Be knowledgeable, understand the menu, and be able to show the customer your expertise in your line of work. The service industry is much underrated, but not everyone can do it.

Know your customers and let situations dictate the kind of service that is needed. Business professionals on lunch want to be left alone to conduct business. They may not want to sit and chat. A birthday party may require a lot of attentiveness. You could make a great or bad memory for the customerâs special day.

Do not act over-eager. Show the customer that they matter. If they feel that, they will reward you. When they think, you are just there to see what is left on the table, you may not see much there. Always remember it is gratuity, the customers have already paid for the food.

Act responsible.",How to Get a Bartending Job," In order to make drinks that look and taste like they were made by a professional, you'll need to learn basic bartending skills beyond just pouring and mixing. Check out online tutorials with information on the following techniques, then practice them until you have them memorized. Here are some basics you should know before you start looking for a bartending job:



Shaking. This involves using a cocktail shaker to mix and chill drinks.Straining. Cocktail shakers have built-in strainers, which you use to strain the ice from the liquid.

Stirring. There's a proper way to do this to ensure the drink doesn't get watered down.
Muddling. This involves using a muddler to press the flavor from fresh ingredients.
Blending. You'll need a blender to make drinks like blended margaritas.;
, Start building your knowledge of different types of alcohol and learning how to make the most popular drinks. To a certain extent, the type of drinks you'll need to know how to make depends on the bar where you work; a high-end urban bar might focus on specialty martinis, while a college bar might serve a lot of Irish car bombs. Still, no matter where you work, you'll need the most popular standards in your repertoire. Learn how to make the following:


Basic mixed drinks like a whiskey soda, a greyhound, orange juice and vodka, Jack and coke, gin and tonic, and so on.
Other highballs like a bloody Mary, dark and stormy, fuzzy navel, melon ball, and Alabama slammer.
Lowballs such as a White Russian, a godfather, and a peppermint patty.
Martinis, Manhattans, and Rob Roys.
Tropical drinks like pina coladas, daiquiris, margaritas and hurricanes.
Shots like a lemon drop, slippery nipple, JÃ¤ger bomb or an orgasm.
Other cocktails like a mimosa, a mint julep, a mojito, or an Irish coffee.

, There are little tricks to pouring a good beer, mixing drinks, and saving time behind the bar. Watch how your mixer handles drink orders. Most of it is not rocket science; the most commonly ordered drinks are liquor plus a mixer. Buy drink manuals to learn about the more complex drinks and practice at home.

, They'll teach you the basics and you'll have an opportunity to practice making drinks. Make sure the school you choose has a real working bar and all real bartending equipment. Bartending is a manual skill that requires speed and dexterity. There is no substitute for hands on training.

, A lot of bartending jobs are advertised on online classifieds websites. Do a job search and keep a list of the jobs that sound appealing to you. Some may ask you to submit a resume online, while others will ask you to come in for an in-person interview.


If you're worried you don't have enough experience, that shouldn't necessary deter you from applying. If you've practiced bartending skills and memorized the drinks, you may get hired anyway.
Make sure your resume is up to date, well-written, and proofread. Highlight any customer service experience you have, not just bartending experience. Any type of restaurant work is also a plus.
Some establishments prefer to hire bartenders with no experience because they won't have any bad habits to break. Experienced or not, the cover letter and resume need to be exciting and pop with personality. A great personality and attitude will elevate you above the competition every time.

, If you have a favorite watering hole, find out who the owner is and start talking him/her up. Befriend the bartenders, barbacks, and cocktail waitresses, and let them know you're looking for a bartending job. Tip well, go often, and generally be a happy, useful presence at the bar. The manager will be happy to hire you when a position opens up.

, Many big cities are now offering this option. You pick a charity, promote the event, and bring your friends in. In exchange, you and a couple friends get trained for the evening and get to mix drinks all night. It's a great way to get some experience and make contacts. If you impress the bar owner, it could lead to a job.

, Many bartending job applicants go into their job interviews unprepared. If you look at bartending as a quick fix or so easy to do that you don't need to prepare, you will not get the job. Just like you would for any job, show up to the interview with a positive, friendly attitude and respect for the position.


Dress the part. Your appearance will be a factor when it's time to interview for a job. If you want a gig at a fancy restaurant, dress professionally. If you want a job at a hip club, dress edgy. If a dive bar gig is fine by you, dress tough. Most bars are going for a certain look or image, whether they tell you that or not.
Be ready to show your skills. Don't show up without knowing how to make a martini.

, If you have a fun, charismatic personality, your lack of experience won't matter nearly as much. Tell some funny anecdotes and crack a lot of jokes. Make it clear that you love talking to people, telling stories, and lending an ear.

, A bartender's job is fun, but there's also a lot of responsibility involved. You have to open and close the bar, handle cash and credit cards, make sure you don't serve minors, and stop serving people who've had enough to drink. Show that you're mature and capable of handling the types of situations that are bound to arise late at night when the alcohol is flowing.

A GED is fine. Whichever form you choose, it's essential to get good grades and to learn computer skills.;
, Having extra, focused knowledge makes you a prime candidate when you walk into any office (or start your own business).


Check out your local community colleges, vocational schools, and industry associations for classes. The classes should focus on reservation systems, travel regulations (both domestic and international), and marketing.

, Few schools offer on-site degrees in this, but it's worth the research if one is in your area. However, loads offer classes online.


University of Southern MississippiJohnson & Wales University
University of Massachusetts Isenberg School of Management
East Carolina University
Robert Morris University
Strayer UniversityIf you plan to start your own travel agency, you will need business courses as well.



, Depending on your location and business set-up, you may need a travel agent license (if you have a host, you may be able to use their license number). Even if you don't live in an area that requires one but are planning to sell to residents of those states, it's worth looking into.


6 US states currently have seller of travel laws:

California (the strictest and most complex)
Florida
Iowa
Washington
Hawaii
Nevada (suspended until July 2013)


Louisiana and Delaware have loose restrictions on new agencies.
All agents and supervisors/managers in Ontario, Canada must take the Travel Industry Council of Ontario (TICO) exam. It currently rings up at $32 CAD.
Travel agencies in British Columbia, Canada are required by the Insurance Council of British Columbia to take a travel insurance exam. Itâs a license tied to the agency and every travel agent in the agency is required to attend 2 hours of training a year.
The licensing for those in Saskatchewan, Canada is again related to travel insurance and involves an exam required by the Insurance Council of Saskatchewan. Unlike the licensing in British Colombia though, this license is tied to the travel agent, not the agency. Agents are required to attend 3 hours of training every year.

, These generally take two forms; both add to your credibility as a travel agent.


Classes and training at an undergrad level and your IATAN (International Airlines Travel Agent Network) ID card.
Supplemental training at schools like The Travel Institute and the International Airline Transport Associationâs Training and Development Institute. Both provide training and professional development opportunities for experienced travel agents. Examinations for different levels of certification are offered depending on a travel agentâs experience.If you have a designated area of interest, certification from an organization such as the Cruise Lines International Association could never hurt.


Beware of ""card-mills."" For a relatively small fee, they mysteriously give you a ""travel agent qualification."" It's a scam.

, To be a successful travel agent, you must be worldly, confident, and one heck of a networker. Even if you're working for a parent company, you have to convince your clients that you're offering them the best vacation they could possibly have.


Be adventurous. Part of the job description is willing to scope out and analyze different, sometimes dangerous, sometimes exotic, areas.
Hone your communication skills. When you're not doing on-the-scene research, you'll be behind a desk, emailing and talking on the phone. Your success rate is based on how well you can communicate.
Zero-in on the details. Every person has a different ideal vacation--making sure everything from the curtains to the bus air conditioning system is beyond the standard is what makes a returning customer.
Get organized. You'll be dealing with dozens of itineraries simultaneously. Keeping things straight and meeting deadlines is imperative to success.
Make connections. You're going to need clients to make commission, so start talking. Be the go-to for all your friends and family when it comes to travel information and itinerary organization. Start networking today.

, You cannot sell a product that you're unfamiliar with. Getting out there or seeing it for yourself puts you in the clients' shoes and prepares you for unforeseen problems.


Being able to dispense first-hand information is invaluable. Clients are more interested in hearing suggestions based on first-hand accounts of services, accommodations and geographic areas. This is the reason travel agents often receive discounts while traveling.
Knowing a foreign language (or two) definitely helps!

, Before you start any career, familiarize yourself with the market and what you're getting into.


The beginning travel agent makes, on average, around $15 an hour or around $30,000 a year.
In the US as of 2010, there were 82,000 travel agents (a 10% rise is projected for 2020).

, In order to thrive in this work environment, it's helpful to have an area of expertise. Have you wandered the markets of Istanbul? Cracked coconuts in the Mekong Delta? Choose a region that appeals to you.


Some specialties could include a specific geographic location like Mexico; specific types of travel like cruises or tour groups; price-focused travel such as luxury accommodations or affordable vacations; and particular travel groups based on hobbies, special interests or lifestyles such as seniors or vegetarians.

, The number of travel agents working for themselves is increasing rapidly. Decide whether you want to work under the umbrella of a brick and mortar company or just through a host company, working on your own.


YTB, Traverse, and GT Trends all give you a website that you call ""your own"" for a minimal fee. They train and support you and provide your initial income. They all have a parent company; if you'd like to cut out the middleman, you can pair with the parent company yourself. As always, do the research yourself to find what's right for you.

, Starting as a receptionist or assistant can lead to more responsibilities and opportunities to advance while you're enrolled in a travel agent program.


Don't be afraid to just get your foot in the door. Some companies, like Virtuoso, recommend 20 years of experience before you start working with them.

, Whether you're working from home or in an office, raising your voice is the only way to let people know you're getting on the ground and running. Do the research and start making offers.


Create a referral service with another travel agent or agents who can refer business to you in your specialty and you can do the same for them. You can sometimes work out a mutual-referral agreement with another agent in order to collect referral fees.

, The quickest way to hone your craft is to observe and mirror other professionals in your field. Join an organization to surround yourself with similar individuals who may be a few years ahead of you.


Professional organizations, such as the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) provide support, further education and training opportunities, resources, networking opportunities, travel tools, publication access, evaluation services, invitations to seminars, expos and summits, scholarships for students and salary tools.
These organizations also give you access to job boards and travel school directories, if you're looking for career rejuvenation.

Learn the menu in advance.,

Listen to experienced employees carefully.,
Keep up with the pace.,
Perform unpleasant tasks without complaining.,
Take criticisms in stride.,
Volunteer for extra shifts.,
Ask questions when you don't know how to do something.",How to Be a Great Waitress4," When you interview, be proactive and ask for a menu to take with you. Study it on your own to become familiar with the food available. Chain restaurants have great training programs that guide you through the menu and kitchen; bars and smaller places expect you to learn on your own.

, Punctuality is important for any job, especially one you've just started. Restaurants are particularly fast-paced during peak hours, however, and you'll make a good impression if you're ready to work on the dot or even a little in advance., Even if you have worked as a waitress before, you should pay attention to the details of your new job. Each restaurant does things slightly differently, and paying attention during training will let you do your job more smoothly.It also never hurts to be respectful to your boss and coworkers, of course, rather than blowing them off with phrases such as ""I know this already.""

, If you've never worked in a busy restaurant before, you could be surprised by how fast-paced and exhausting the work is. Do your best to keep up to the pace of the other waitstaff. As you grow more accustomed to the job, you'll have a somewhat easier time. At the beginning, you may need to push yourself., You'll start at the bottom of the totem pole, but you won't work your way up by complaining. Clean tables and work unpleasant hours if you are asked to, and remember that you'll have more choice once you're more established., Waiting tables can feel a little cutthroat, as some waitstaff will blame you personally if they think you contributed to a bad customer experience (and therefore a bad tip).Know that you'll receive less criticism once you learn the ropes, and try to smile and not let it get to you.


This is definitely not true of every restaurant. Don't be scared off from applying to a waiting job before you know the atmosphere of the establishment.

, Especially in the beginning, you want management and coworkers to know you are reliable. Once you know you can handle an extra shift, volunteer to cover a gap in the schedule so you stand out to your new boss.

, Show an interest in learning specific skills or restaurant practices. Always ask how to do something if you are afraid of making a mistake. People know you're new, and you should be able to find at least one person who appreciates when you ask questions.


This does not mean you should question your job. ""What time do I get off?"" or ""Do I have to do this?"" are common phrases that will irritate your coworkers and employer.

Communicate with your venue.,
Source suitable staff.,
Foster a pleasant working environment.,
Ensure that the technology used for the event is compatible.,
Pay attention to the background.,
Check the accessibility for guests.,
Don't leave catering until the last minute.,
Allow for delegatesâ focus to wax and wane over the day.,
Consider break-out times.,
Nip problems in the bud.",How to Avoid Disruption and Distractions During Events," Determine your aims and objectives from the outset. This will help you to determine which venue is right for you. Do your research and take on board any recommendations while keeping in mind what youâre looking to achieve.


Privacy may be essential to your event. If so, restrict your search to dedicated venues with a track record of catering to sensitive, top-level, or exclusive meetings.
Accessibility might be important. You may have delegates coming from all over the country, so focus on easily accessible venues to reduce the risk of delays.;
, This is the single most important factor. Amicable communication between the venue's owner, event organizers and hosts is important in establishing the requirements of the event. Be sure on all of this during the initial conversations and when drawing up a brief. Itâs this brief that forms the cornerstone for ensuring that the event experiences minimal interruptions, taking into account any limitations of the facilities.

, Some venues will have in-house staff, while others will require you to have your own. Either way, staff wield incredible power in determining whether an event goes smoothly or not: Ineffective staff and unhelpful or unknowledgeable staff can have a negative impact.


Take the time to carefully consider the teams that will look after you and your guests, and try to ascertain whether theyâll be more of a help or a hindrance. Even when itâs family or friends, you will want to weigh out their dedication to your event and determine if you will need them or could do without them as helpers.

, Doing this not only helps deliver good morale but can inspire efficiency from all those involved in the meeting or event. Itâs therefore important to try to make your event venue as conducive to work as possible:


It could be simple things like the temperature, seating arrangement, natural lighting. It could also be things like motivation from supervisors/heads or pay.
Itâs not unusual to enforce a âno phone no emailâ rule, especially if these will get in the way of delivering a good event. This can ensure staff/guestsâ minds are focused on the task at hand, and not back at the office or pressures from home.

, One of the most significant causes for disruption to events is technical issues on-site. Ask the event venue owners to confirm whatâs available for use for your event, and check whether there will any related costs for what you need. It's common for venues, for example, to charge extra for certain items, including remote controls for projectors, or video public address systems. These issues can be ironed out with a prior visits leading up to the event day specifically to check whatever devices that will be used for your event will be compatible with the venueâs offering.


Establish what to do and who to contact in case of a technical issue on the day to ensure that if anything does go wrong, there is a point of contact to promptly resolve it.

, Attention during events can easily be diverted with unnecessary background noise, be it a passing train or squabbling kids in the playfield. Background noise is one of the biggest bugbears for guests and a considerable factor in generating disruption. Noise-related nuisances can also be on-site such as cleaners or builders. Ensure that the event venue is not overly exposed to excessive outside noise (avoid paper thin walls or windows opening on to busy roads for example) to minimise disruption, and if there is building work taking place, request an area far away from the site to reduce your events are disruption or even ask if such activities could be stopped for the duration of your event.

, Being able to get to the venue with ease is something event organizers must take seriously. It is easily a source of disruption as it effects guestsâ enjoyment before theyâve even stepped into the event venue. This can set the event off on the wrong foot, resulting in guests arriving late, or starting the day irritated and unfocused. Itâs therefore important that you factor this in to your decision when selecting a venue.


Be sure to discuss any concerns you might have to venue owners to see if any extra provisions could be set up to assist delegates both prior to and on the day.

, Catering is not a last resort affair. Again this will depend on whether you will use in house catering services or outside caterers. Itâs a crucial component of any event which is easily forgotten. Don't underestimate the value of event foodââit can singlehandedly make or break an event and catering is one of the most important factors that generates value. Get it right, and you will most likely win all the plaudits, otherwise, itâs a definite fail.


In-house dedicated catering teams will be well-versed in catering procedures for all types of events, so will be more adept at scheduling meal times for large numbers of guests.
This may not necessarily be the case for an outside caterer so care must be taken so that as well as that gorgeous food, catering services are delivered on time and are able to cater for all types of dietary requirements.
Catering intervals overrunning is another source of disruption. Establish the best times to factor in welcome drinks, canapÃ©s, dinner, and speech drinks.
Itâs also a good idea to consider a separate eating location, if possible, to avoid the dinnertime rush and mitigate any undesirable delays.

, When drawing up your itinerary, tackle the most important content at the beginning of the session when delegates are likely to be more alert, and incorporate any group work or more stimulating tasks after the inevitable post-dinner slump, so as to boost engagement and reduce the likelihood of internal distractions.

, Periodic breaks in the day during the event will allow guests a change of scenery and the opportunity to enjoy and revel in the moment of the event. Ensure there are enough refreshments, for example, available throughout the event or only at set times, and make sure the slots fit in with your itinerary.


Restricted time break-out slots can sometimes run in with other items on the itinerary so a good idea is to offer unlimited refreshments during the whole event to give flexibility to guests to help themselves as and when.
Drinking water points with water coolers can save delegates wandering around for a drink halfway through is well positioned.

, In most cases, issues of one kind or another will most definitely ariseââyou've minimal control over the delegates, things not turning up as requested, power outages and so forth. Itâs important to be prepared to address these issues as quickly and effectively as they arise to avoid dragging out the disruption and causing more damage. Of course, some small disruptions may be unavoidable, but donât assume regular distractions are a normal and therefore an inevitable part of the event.


If you do encounter unacceptable levels of disruptionâwhether it be background noise, technical issues, or an unhelpful team memberâalert someone in charge at the venue to quickly and constructively restore order to get things back on track.

Throw out the trash.",How to Be an Efficient Restaurant Dishwasher," At any restaurant, Fridays and Saturdays are the most popular days of the week for people dine out with family and friends. When you get in the back of the house, it's good to review the station before jumping in on the action.;
, Put any clean dishes and utensils away and claim any dirty dishes from around the restaurant. Use the beginning part of your shift to get as far ahead as possible, as this will minimize unnecessary stacking later.

, All automatic dishwasher machines are connected to a soap line and can be refilled using removable jugs or bottles. Ensure you have a full load or enough to get you through the shift.

, Like sinks, dishwasher drains can handle so much food before creating problems, such as water overflowing. Especially working the second or third shift, you do not want the previous dishwasher's leftovers clogging your drain.

, If you cannot create or stay with a rhythm, you will get stressed out. Dishwashers must handle just about any dish from the different sections of the restaurant: Servers and bussers may give you the typical plates, glasses, and utensils; the cooks might give you pans and pots; and the prep cooks may give you prep pans, cutting boards, whisks, and bowls.

, The sprayer will stop a lot of food from entering the machine, since you are pre-rinsing them. Avoid spending too much time on one rack, though. Establish the rhythm of going back and forth.âYou should spend only a few seconds on a rack before pushing it.

, You could possibly get away using an abrasive wire sponge on a charred and greasy pan, but use a non-abrasive scrub on ceramic dishes.


If you have an automatic dishwasher, push the item through the machine and allow the hot water loosen the food from the dish.
If you are required to wash by hand, add hot, soapy water to the dish and set it aside for a few minutes to allow it to soak.

, Never think the machine is going to do all the work for you. As you do your job, make a mental list of foods that needs to be scrubbed off in their entirety before putting sending the dish through the machine. Some foods include:


Melted cheese

Clam chowder and other chunky soups
Egg yolk
Sauces
Mashed potatoes

, Cooks likely have a limited amount of saute pans to work with, so, if they need you to clean them, that should be your first priority.âThe other dishes will have to be queued behind the high-priority dish of the moment.



Maintain focus on other important things used in the restaurant, such as bread holders for servers and key utensils used by the prep cooks. Always keep an eye on the silverware: Knives are given out with meat dishes, bread, and baked potatoes; spoons are given out with coffee, ice cream, and other desserts.

, It's frustrating beyond belief to do so, but put yourself in a diner's view. - You would like the best and most enjoyable meal when you dine out, but what if you found your meal came on a plate with a smudge of leftover sauce from the previous diner?

, Ensure dishes are whistle-clean before stacking or putting them on the side. If there are food remnants or stains, rewash the item.

, Incorporate a rhythm of splitting up the clean dishes on every other run to different parts of the restaurant. Most-to-all restaurants have a rack, counter, or pushcart to stack dishes and utensils.

, If you are on a dinner shift, you must thoroughly clean all drains as much as you can.

, Treat the area as your own kitchen and clean it out as much as you can.

, When you are finished rinsing your final load, this is typically when all servers, cooks, and bussers are gone. Depending on how exhausted and soaked you are, the first thing on your mind is liable to be: Bunch dishes in the easiest spots available, clock out, and hit the road. You must condition yourself to be patient and complete everything to near-perfection before walking out the door. Learn to persist in putting each and every item away in its appointed place, so your co-workers can easily find everything the next day.

, Garbage take-out usually lands on the dishwasher's list of things to do, although some restaurant establishments have cleaning crews that handle this responsibility.


Be safe when doing so. Taking out restaurant trash is never the same as normal trash, as it will include wet food, water, and other items that will weigh the bags down greatly. Use the proper lifting techniques (bending your knees) or get another person to help you lift. Refrain from twisting your spine while handling an over-heavy burden. Move your feet to turn your body appropriately.

Publicize the SOB Syndrome.",How to Deal With an Abusive Boss With the SOB Syndrome," Many people are difficult to work for, but are not included in the scope of discussion. These people achieve excellent results while being difficult to work with; Dr. Michael DeBakey and Admiral Hyman Rickover are extreme examples of demanding bosses that achieve world-class results. If you cannot keep up with them, that is your problem. This topic examines the abusive, pointless, wasteful behavior by managers that harms the workers and the goals of the organization.;
, The worst cases of bullying behavior seem to originate within a narrow profile of easily recognizable managerial behavior, but only if you know what to look for. This type behavior is sometimes identified as the ""SOB Syndrome"". ""SOB boss"" symptoms include:


Expresses a very negative view of himself, referring explicitly to himself as ""a tough son-of-a-bitch"" or ""a tough little bastard"" when in fact he hardly gets tough, productive results. SOB yes, tough no. Female managers in the pattern may refer to themselves as a ""tough bitch"". This signature statement, ""I am a tough SOB,"" is a dead giveaway of the SOB personality, but is usually not spoken in the presence of upper management.
Acts respectfully toward upper management, and has all the requisite qualifications for his position: experience, education, certifications, etc.
Is abusive, dishonest, and erratic in dealing with subordinates. Subordinates see both sides of the SOB's personality and that is why subordinates may think the SOB is ""crazy,"" but upper management sees the SOB only at his best behavior and may consider him ""outstanding.""
The SOB's erratic behavior may include a lack of emotional control around subordinates, resulting in temper tantrums, profane outbursts, and occasional violence.

, If your abusive manager meets all the criteria of the SOB Syndrome, you are in a precarious position, subject to stress-related illnesses, termination, demotion, or transfer. You are advised to leave, if you are able. In fact, the SOB's situation is no less precarious. SOBs are known to suffer career and personality meltdowns, after they have done much damage to the organization and to the workers. The SOB targets his more capable subordinates because he finds them threatening to his position. The SOB manager presides over a very unhealthy working environment.

, The personality of the SOB creates a very sick workplace culture. An SOB should not be in a management position. SOB's conditions are infectious. When you have an SOB in charge of an organization, clusters of emotional illnesses, productivity problems, and high personnel turnover are the norm, at great expense to the organization.


These problems commonly disappear, or are re-located, with a change of managers or a change of jobs for the SOB manager.
While you can sympathize with the SOB's problems, that does not justify the damage he does to the workers and to the organization. Some SOBs are known to have been severely abused in childhood, and this may well be a factor in other SOB personalities; something surely disturbed the SOB's personality development.
The substance-abusing personality is a close parallel to the SOB personality, but the SOB is found more frequently and creates greater costs and damages. Substance abusers are subject to management and HR scrutiny, and the incidence of substance abuse constantly receives attention and correction. Both the bully boss and the SOB receive much attention, but little effort is made to correct their behavior. The SOB personality is not generally recognized as a medical or psychological problem. There is little effort to correct the SOB's behavior because management cannot identify the nature of the problem.

, The problem of the bully boss/SOB personality will be corrected when it is properly recognized, costs are acknowledged, and demand for correction is voiced. This will have to be done from bottom up, as the SOB takes pains to conceal his abusive treatment of subordinates from management. HR or other professionals may help alert management of the problem, as it may be easier to educate HR than to educate management.

Donât get pushed around.",How to Deal With a Lazy Boss," Don't fall into a trap of matching laziness with laziness. Instead, always do your work effectively and efficiently, challenging yourself to do your very best. You'll set an example for your coworkers, your boss, and your job consistently well may have long-term payoffs, such as a promotion.You may be tempted to give your boss a taste of their own medicine and be equally lazy. This is rarely productive, as your boss is likely unaware that you are mirroring their behavior, instead seeing you as independently lazy.;
, Your boss may have reasons for their behavior that you're not aware of, or they might have personal issues impacting their work performance. Before you complain to HR, try to understand your boss, what makes them tick, what they care about, and what frustrates them.Just as you have an entire life outside of the workplace, so does your boss. You may not know that they have another full time job, or that theyâre ill, or that theyâre taking care of a colicky newborn. Getting to know your boss establishes a rapport and allows you to understand their position a bit better.

, Get to know the layout of the company and learn the chain of command. While it is not the first or second best option, it is good to know who your boss's boss is, in case you need to escalate the issue.This step is for primarily for your information, because you want to try different approaches first. It is good information to have on hand if all else fails, though.

, It might be that your boss is not lazy, but does not fully understand your work description, theirs, or your coworkersâ. Similarly, work tends to trickle downward, and thatâs especially true with a lazy boss. Read through all relevant job descriptions and if you find that youâre doing more than what you were hired to do, have a conversation with your boss about assigning tasks to the appropriate employee, which may be them.Often on-the-job responsibilities change much faster than job descriptions are updated.
There is also sometimes a murky overlap among positions, leaving room for confusion about who is responsible for what.

, While the thought of talking to your boss about their performance may be intimidating, it is often the best route to take. Do so carefully, though. Don't rush into the conversation, consider what the issues really are, and stick to those issues only. Talk about behaviors rather than directly about your employer.Be respectful and constructive. Approach your boss with the right tone and with the intention of communicating well.
If that doesn't work, and as a second resort, you might talk with your boss's boss, but understand most employers won't be happy that you talked with their boss.
Lastly, you might need to go to Human Resources for resolution with the problem.
Remember, you want to keep your job, so approach any of these conversations with a positive and professional attitude.

, Giving a supervisor feedback can be uncomfortable, especially when itâs about a behavior of theirs, but it doesnât have to be. Make your statements âIâ rather than âyouâ oriented, which will help you avoid sounding critical. Also, it allows you to make suggestions regarding yourself or your team rather than telling your boss how to conduct themselves.For example, you could tell your boss, âI think that our team would be more productive if we each submitted a daily accountability sheet. I can set that up so that all of us could access it, if youâd like.â Youâre not pointing fingers, and are offering a solution that will increase their accountability as well.
You might also say, âI think that we could implement a buddy system on this project to ensure that everyone has an immediate resource available should they need it, which might help the project get done faster and better.â Youâre focusing on actions and solutions with this statement, but also opening room for dialogue.

, Make a list of your bossâs behaviors that you find disruptive in the workplace, such as examples of their laziness -- note the date, time, and circumstances. You might even arrange the list from most to least disruptive. Come back to your list a few days later and focus on the top few items. If they really are as big of a deal as you originally thought, decide if theyâre worth talking to your boss about., Accept what you cannot change. You will likely decide that much of your list is not really a dealbreaker or something that you can productively bring up to your boss. You need to make a decision to accept those things (that doesnât mean that you have to like them, though) or begin looking for another job. Think about the big picture., This time, turn inward and focus on yourself rather than your boss. Write down every single thing that makes you happy about your job, no matter how big or how small. You might surprise yourself with all the entries on your list, and research has shown that improving your outlook improves your happiness, which only improves your outlook more.You might be grateful for your flexible schedule
Perhaps you get paid vacation days, or holidays and weekends off
You may enjoy the comradery among you and your colleagues
Your job might not be too far from home making for a reasonable commute

, Independent of your bossâs vision, consider what professional goals you have for yourself. Make a list of your short and long-term goals and then prioritize everything in either order of achievability or order of importance to you. Take advantage of any opportunities to combine goals and then develop a plan of action.You might want a promotion in the next six months
Or you might want a raise
Perhaps youâd like to switch from morning to day shift
You want to be designated a lead on the next big project

, Your self-esteem, stress level, and general happiness are important. If your bossâs laziness is impacting your job or emotional health, you need to take some sort of action, whether you decide talk with them or seek other employment. Donât just âdo nothing.â Remember, a job just isnât the right fit if you have to sacrifice your emotional health to make it work.If appropriate, this also opens up a conversation to redefine your position and compensation.

, If you have tried to resolve the issues with your boss and are still unhappy, you may need to consider that itâs time to find a new job. Begin networking, clean up your resume, and start actively looking for another position. This doesnât mean defeat, or that something is wrong with your or even your boss. It just means that itâs time for you to move on., Just as you need to evaluate if the items on your list of bad boss behaviors are deal breakers and truly important, you need to evaluate your expectations of your boss, your workplace, and of yourself. This is especially important because it frames how you approach each day, which can have a dramatic impact on your emotional health., You know your job description and what your assigned responsibilities are. Working with others requires an open mind and flexibility, but your boundaries, once defined, are not up for discussion. If your bossâs laziness increases your work load, remind them tactfully and professionally that the extra responsibilities exceed the scope of your current position.Defining your boundaries allows your employer to reflect on their own actions. Perhaps they are unaware that they are underproductive.

, You are likely upset by your bossâs lazy behavior because it impacts your work performance, or even ends up creating more work for you. Because they are your boss, you might feel that you have no choice but to accept that is how things are. Donât be pushed around and donât be a pushover. Be your own advocate in a cool, calm, and professional way.If you are feeling taken advantage of, for example, because your bossâs paperwork keeps piling up on your desk, try saying, âIâve noticed that Iâm now receiving all invoices for our suppliers, and since that isnât part of my job description, I would like to route these to the appropriate personnel so that these are paid quickly and correctly.âs

Prove your worth and value.",How to Deal With a Boss Who Makes Promises But Never Delivers," If youâve been promised something from your boss, whether itâs raise or a promotion, it likely has strings attached. Get clarification on what they need from you (higher productivity, more work hours, attending more trainings) in order to get that promotion or raise. Clarify with your boss when they expect to be able to fulfill the promise.Keep in mind it is best to clarify expectations in-person at the time the promise is made. You can summarize your understanding of the promise and get them to do the same until your on the same page.;
, Writing alerts the boss to fact that you expect the promise to be met. Make notes as you meet with your boss in-person and send them a summary of your meeting after you leave.


You can send an e-mail saying thank you for the discussion, summarizing the promise, and confirming that your understanding of expectations is accurate.

, If the promise has not been delivered according to your expectations, be careful before you react. Make sure your reaction is justified by evaluating if you're being impatient. Take a look at your calendar to determine if a reasonable amount of time has passed from when your boss made the promise. Look back over what you wrote down about the promise and ensure you've fulfilled every requirement your boss asked you to before confronting your boss.


Don't avoid reacting and confronting forever! If you're the type of person who always lets things slide or hopes for the best, your boss could take advantage of you by never delivering the promise., If you know you've fulfilled your end of the promise, look for other reasons for the delay. There could be a valid reason outside your control, or even your boss' control, that has left the promise undelivered. Look through your company manual, observe day-to-day practices, or consult with Human Resources for information you might not have received since the promise was first made. Some questions you might ask include:Has your company been restructured, downsized, or bought out?
Has your boss become ill or taken a leave of absence?
Has there been in a change in how long it typically takes to get a policy changed, a promotion, or a raise?
Has there been a change in the typical procedure for getting a policy changed, a promotion, or a raise?
Have promotions or raises been put on hold?

, Before directly confronting your boss, give him/her a gentle reminder of the promise they made you. Be brief and simply request more information, rather than accusing or getting angry. The best way is to send a quick e-mail, but be mindful that your boss may not get back to you right away.You can say, âI know youâve been really busy at work the last few months, but I wanted to touch base because I havenât heard anything about my promised promotion since we talked on March 29, 2016. Iâd appreciate an update about it soon.â

, If your boss doesnât respond to you, try talking with them again in-person. Be up front in a polite and assertive manner and bring along your written summary of the promise. Keep it factual, thank the boss for letting you have the opportunity, and be genuine about how the experience has readied you for the promised promotion, bonus, job change, etc. Send another follow-up email after this talk summarizing your conversation.

, Getting your boss to meet your needs and fulfill his/her promises will be easier when you make it about you, rather than questioning his/her competence or integrity. Be specific about what you need from your boss in order to get the promise fulfilled. Consider if you need more helpful feedback, assistance from another colleague, etc.For example, if you were offered a promotion but it hasnât gone through yet, you can say, âI want to get that promotion we agreed on and I need your help to do that. Give me input on what Iâm doing right or what other direction I should head in with this position to get me to that promotion.â

, Once youâve been made the promise and youâve asked for feedback and help from your boss to get it fulfilled, check back in with your boss on a weekly basis. Implement the feedback your boss has given you and update him/her on the progress you make toward that promotion (or whatever it is) every week. After a month or two has passed and youâve fulfilled all of your bossâ expectations, itâs time to meet with them again and get them to re-evaluate their promise.You can say, âWeâve been discussing a promotion since March and I feel Iâve been on track for that by meeting and exceeding goals and objectives for the last three months. Iâd like to know what else I should do and how weâre going to move forward with the promotion now.â
Keep in mind to keep a timeline and record of all your check-ins with your boss, preferably via email in case you need to consult Human Resources later.

, It can be hard when bosses are being vague about promises not to get angry or frustrated. While it may be tempting to get mad, shout, and threaten to quit after youâve worked hard at your job, this could make the situation worse. Instead, you boss may feel threatened and try to find a reason to fire you., Instead of getting angry, let your boss know how you feel about the broken promise. Be clear about how this has impacted you. This holds them accountable and might make them feel guilty for their actions.You can say, âI feel unhappy that I havenât been promoted by now. I feel like Iâve worked hard toward that goal and met your expectations.â

, If your boss still doesnât respond to you or help you, go to his superiors or consult Human Resources for help. However, proceed with caution. Your boss and his superiors could feel threatened. Try to show them the pattern of broken promises that has emerged over time with your boss.You can:Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your boss' superior (without your boss present) or the Human Resources department.
Bring along any paper trails you have of your bosses promises, such as meeting minutes or emails.
Briefly explain how the broken promises have impacted your work at the company.
Request a change in position or a new boss to better achieve your goals in the company.

, If youâve done everything you can to hold up your end of the bargain and your boss still isnât following through on his/her promise, consider leaving that position. Evaluate how youâre really feeling about your job at this point and if you can continue to work with your boss, knowing he/she may not fulfill this promise or others. If this cycle just keeps on continuing and you keep feeling used, it is probably time to move on to a different company where you will get that raise, promotion, etc.

, The boss wants you to do the work because you're good at it. Keep in mind during this entire process of negotiations and interactions with your boss, youâve increased your skills in communication and problem solving at work. Even if itâs been a frustrating time for you, these skills will be useful in other jobs in the future., Understand that your boss is human and may be under pressure or have to answer to the whims of his superiors. He might make a promise with the intention of keeping it, but something might change in the company that affects his ability to do that. Refrain from judging your boss before you have all the facts. Try to understand the stressors heâs under before writing him off as a boss., Remember that you are in control. Only you can control your reaction to your boss and his/her unfulfilled promises. You can control if you want to stay in the job and what emotions rule you when youâre at work. You can take care of yourself and your attitude at work by:Focusing on what makes you happy at work.
Paying attention to who you enjoy working with.
Doing more of what provides you with a sense of fulfillment.
Avoiding taking work home with you.

, Even if your boss isnât fulfilling promises or acting with integrity at work, strive hard to do that yourself. Step up and prove yourself worthwhile of your position. Focus on what you like about your company and what you want to do to contribute. At the very least, youâll be building your skills and experience for your next position somewhere else.You can prove your value by trying to:Make yourself stand out from your co-workers.
Seek out training opportunities.
Try to develop new talents and skills.
Ask for help when you need it.

Decide if action is required.,
Talk to colleagues.,
Keep a record.,
Consider your options.",How to Deal With a Boss Showing Favoritism1," The first thing to do is calmly and rationally think through the whole situation. Is your boss really favouring somebody unfairly? Is it proving detrimental to the morale and productivity of you and your colleagues? You have to be completely honest with yourself and be certain that it's not just because the favourite is the best at her job.It's not unusual to feel jealous of someone who is having more success, so be sure you are not projecting your concerns about your slow professional progress onto someone else., One good way to try to get some perspective on the issue is to talk it over with some colleagues to see if they share your perception of events. If you do this, it's very important that you tread carefully. Don't go throwing accusations around and don't try to convince other members of your team of your interpretation of the situation. Just ask for honest appraisals to better inform your judgement.


It's important that you don't try and turn the rest of your team against the person you believe is being shown unfair favouritism. This will not endear you to anyone or help your case.Avoid turning it into a topic for office gossip or rumour and maintain your professionalism., To help you get a clear picture of what is going on, it's a good idea to keep a record of instances where you think you have been treated unfairly, or there has been unwarranted favouritism shown. This could include examples of the other person consistently receiving more interesting and engaging jobs to do, or a significant imbalance in the rewards for similar work.You may need this evidence later, but first of all think of it as a way to carefully analyse the situation and gain objective information.
You need to be exceptionally honest and rigorous when you record such incidents.

, Once you have fully taken stock of the situation you should think carefully about what options are available to you, and what the likely consequences of any action would be. You should try to clearly envision what outcome you wish to achieve before you go any further. Keep in mind that it's important not to allow a toxic situation to fester.

Do your research before switching jobs.",How to Deal with a Bad Boss," If you are struggling to have a good relationship with your boss, then you shouldn't stew in silence. Talking to your boss about the problems you're having in a calm, polite, and professional manner can help you work together to resolve them. Of course, the type of relationship you have and the type of person your boss is can affect how you approach your conversation, but in general, saying something and trying to improve the relationship is superior to getting angry and frustrated and not being able to get your work done.You'd be surprised by how many bosses have no idea that the people they are managing are feeling overlooked, angry, frustrated, or like they're getting mixed signals. When you voice your concerns with your boss, then he or she will be grateful that you said something.
If you never say anything to your boss about it, then there are almost no chances that your work relationship or your work environment will improve. Saying something is unpleasant, but it'll be worth it in the long run.
You should carefully plan what you'll say, ask your boss to set a time to talk, and come prepared with evidence and examples of times when you were frustrated with your situation.;
, Though it may feel good to undermine your boss or to make him or her look foolish or incompetent, in the long run, it's far better to help your boss look better and to achieve goals that are good for you and the company. If you spend your time making your boss look incompetent at meetings or sabotaging your boss's efforts to get work done, then you'll only be poisoning your relationship and your work environment. Instead of making things work for yourself, try to help your boss achieve goals and everything will run more smoothly.Sure, the last thing you may want to do is to work with someone you don't really respect all that much. But this is far better than constantly being at odds with someone you work with.

, Though documenting all of the annoying or horrible things your boss has done to you may not sound like the greatest way to spend your time, you should start doing this once you feel like the situation has gotten out of hand. Keep all of your negative email correspondences, save memos that show that your boss is giving mixed messages, and just do whatever you can to document all of the problems you have had in your professional relationship. This is advisable for two reasons:One, if you and your boss discuss your problematic relationship and your boss acts like he or she doesn't know what you're talking about, then you have something to point to as proof. If your boss just hears that you're getting mixed messages, it's less effective than showing him or her two emails with completely different messages.
If your boss is the type to bring false charges against you, then documenting all of your interactions, or even having your communication in front of others, can help you set the record straight.

, Saying negative things about your boss to your coworkers will only fuel the fire at best or get you in trouble at worst. Though you may feel tempted to vent about your boss's managerial style, you should keep your negative feelings to yourself. Having your coworkers join you in complaining about your boss won't make the problem go away, and if the wrong coworker catches word of what you're saying, it may get back to your boss in a very unpleasant way.


You should especially avoid saying anything negative about your boss to your superiors. This won't help your reputation. Remember that you want to look like the agreeable person who gets along with everyone, not like the crank who is always complaining about everyone in the office.

, Another way to improve your relationship with your boss to is to watch out for future problems and try to make them go away before something blows up. Think of it as anticipating the tantrum of a toddler: if you hear your boss begin to fume on the other side of the hallway, you better have prepared something to say to calm him down, or have found a way to stay out of the situation. If you know your boss pretty well, then you should know the kinds of things that set him or her off, and you'd be better off if you came up with a game plan before things exploded.If you know that a coworker is going to introduce a major problem in the office at a meeting, you can talk to your boss about the problem in advance so he or she feels prepared.
If you know that your boss is in a foul mood whenever it's raining and he is stuck in traffic, be prepared for some good news when he or she walks in the door.

, Sure, it may be tempting to exploit your boss's weaknesses, but that won't get you very far in your company or your work environment. Instead, work to help your boss to counteract his or her weaknesses so that everything runs more efficiently and with less conflict. If your boss is chronically late to meetings, offer to kick off the next meeting for him or her. If your boss is disorganized, offer to get the next report into shape before you have to present it to your clients. Look for places where you can really help your boss and jump at the opportunity.If you help your boss get things in order, then your relationship will have to improve. Your boss may even be grateful for it.

, Many managers never receive praise because somehow, it is mistakenly believed that praise should only flow from managers to employees. You may be nervous about approaching your manager to offer advice, but good managers are truly grateful for constructive, useful feedback, and will appreciate any opportunity they get to learn how to do a better job. However, be careful not to flatter a bad boss, because that won't get you anywhere.


Your boss will be impressed at your attempt to make him or her feel more positive about his or her managing style and everything will run more smoothly.

, A bad boss is one who is intentionally mean or unethical and is not receptive to dealing with you in an honest and open way. A bad relationship is an inability to communicate or work together to achieve mutually-beneficial goals. When you approach your situation with your boss, you should focus on the relationship instead of the person. This will help you keep your cool and to find a productive way to address the situation.

, Before you go and blame your boss for all of the problems in your relationship, you should ask yourself whether or not there are aspects of your own performance that can be improved. You may feel like you're acting perfectly, but you should make sure that you're actually meeting the goals you were supposed to meet, pulling your weight with projects, and communicating effectively. Ask yourself if there's anything you can do to improve your own behavior, and if that could be leading to some of the problems you're having with your boss.Of course, maybe your boss really is completely unreasonable and there's nothing you can do to improve how he or she treats you. But it's better to have your bases covered, just in case.

, A healthy dose of humor can help you approach your relationship with your boss and to not take the whole thing too seriously. Though there may not be anything funny about workplace conflict, you have to take a step back and remind yourself that, at the end of the day, your work is not your whole life and that you have plenty of meaningful relationships and outside interests apart from the workplace that give your life meaning. The next time your boss frustrates or just plain annoys you, learn to laugh about it, brush it off, and not to take it so darn seriously all the time.Of course, if your boss is downright offensive, discriminatory, or acting ridiculously out of line, then there's nothing funny about it. But learning to laugh off some of the run-of-the-mill everyday annoyances can help you improve your attitude about your relationship.

, Though you may be tempted to slander your boss, to act childish, to show up late to work just out of spite, or even to do something as silly as stealing your boss's stapler, these antics won't get you anywhere. Even if you find that your boss is childish or immature, you should not stoop down to his or her level and maintain your professional nature at all times â after all, you have to remember that you're at work, not having a bar brawl or chewing out your friend over the phone. Work to maintain your calm and dignity, so that your boss will be the one who looks unprofessional if you have a conflict.If you act unprofessionally, that will reflect poorly on you and your future prospects at your company. You don't want the other people you work with to think you're childish just because your boss is driving you crazy.

, If you and your boss have an altercation, it may feel good to start fighting back with harsh words or abusive language, but only temporarily. Even if your boss blows up at you, you should avoid using offensive language, being aggressive, making personal attacks, or doing anything else that you may want to do to get some of that frustration off your chest. Though it may feel good in the short run, in the long run, you'll only be damaging your relationship further and also incriminating yourself. You want to walk out of there taking the high road, not being implicated in your boss's antics.


If you feel yourself getting so angry that you might say something that you regret, excuse yourself and come back when you feel ready to talk again.

, If you focus on your boss instead of the problem at hand, then you are liable to get frustrated and to make things personal. Instead of getting angry at your boss for being disorganized, confusing, or distant, you should work on addressing the problem at work, whether it's that you have trouble running efficient meetings or that it's difficult for your coworkers to work together on a project because your boss gives you mixed signals. See how you can tackle this problem both by working with your boss and working apart from him.


Looking at the problem at work instead of the potentially frustrating behavior of your boss will make your actions to improve your situation more productive. If you focus more on just how your boss is acting, you are liable to make things personal.

, If the problem has really gotten out of hand, then your best bet may be to talk to your boss's supervisor or someone higher up in the company. If you've tried everything or have just thought it through and realized that there is nothing else you can do, then your best bet may simply be to take the problem to the next level. Talk to your supervisor about the problem. Make it clear that you'd really like to make things work at your company but that you just haven't been able to work with your boss. Be as calm and professional as possible, even if you are upset.


Focus on productivity, not emotions. Don't complain about how your boss is mean or rude, but focus on work-related aspects of the job, such as the fact that your lack of communication makes it difficult to get work done.
Don't bad mouth your boss to your supervisor. Be as kind as possible while voicing your concerns. Don't say that your boss is crazy or completely insane; instead, talk about how your boss has been a bit inflexible or has been changing objectives a lot. You don't want to end up saying something that makes you look like it's hard for you to keep your cool or to get along with others.

, Your boss doesn't have to be the be all and end all to you when you come in to work. If you want to stay at your job but know that you have a difficult relationship with your boss, then you may be better off trying to find someone else at the company who is pleasant to work with and who has a lot to teach you, so that you can focus on other positive relationships. If you've been working with someone you really admire, see if you can find a way to spend more time with that person and to learn more from him or her; this will lead you to have a more positive work experience.If you and the person are friendly and cooperative, then perhaps he or she can shed some light on strategies for best working with your boss. You don't have to bad mouth your boss to get some insight into how to approach your relationship with him. The person can offer some valuable insight about this, especially if he or she has been at the company longer than you.

, Another way you can deal with a bad boss, once you realize you just can't work together, is to simply ask to be transferred to a different department in your company. If you want to stay at the company but have determined that you simply can't work with your boss any more, then your best bet may be to talk to your supervisor about finding a better fit for you within the company. You'll be able to start a new with a better working relationship with a more understanding boss.


If you have worked well with others in the past and have simply found it impossible to work with this particular boss, then it won't reflect poorly on you. In fact, you'll be much better off for taking the initiative to improve your situation.

, If this is the case for you, then it's important that you consult the EEOC (for free) or an employment attorney (for a fee) if you believe you have been discriminated against and you are in a protected class. Some conflicts involve disagreement about what is legal.Â Whistle blowers who report violations may have legal protections, and may consider raising their concerns outside the normal chain of command.If the conflict arises from a fraud to obtain money from the government, whistle blowers may need to follow special procedures to protect their rights. The False Claims Act requires that whistle blowers with original knowledge of such fraud be the first to file their claim, and refrain from public disclosure of certain information about their claim.

, If your situation with your boss has gotten so bad that you can't see a way out of it without leaving the company, then you have to do some soul searching to figure out the right thing to do. If your work situation is hurting your health, your self-esteem, and your general well-being, and there's no way to get transferred or to improve the situation, then it may be time to clock out. However, keep in mind that it can be pretty challenging to find a job, especially in today's economy, and that you should consider whether it's worth it for you to start the search again.Of course, you can do what many people do when they are unhappy at work: start applying for other jobs while you're still at your current job. This will make you a more desirable candidate because you're already employed, and it'll give you a sense of what the market out there is like.
However, if your situation at work is truly intolerable, then you can't make any excuses about the job market to force yourself to stay. You'll know where your breaking point is.

, Some people are so eager to leave their current work situations that they are desperate to take the very next job that gives them an offer. However, before you go and make this step, you should talk to other people at the company, talk to your future boss, and do your research to make sure that you're not escaping a terrible work situation for one that is just as bad. Though you may be eager to leave, it won't benefit you to begin a situation that is no better than the one you escaped.When you accept a new job offer, you should do so with having any bad feelings in your gut about your future boss. Once you make this choice, you'll be on your way to having a productive and healthy working life.

Is she a luddite who uses a flip phone and buys maps at the gas station? Before you construct a travel itinerary for your boss, you need to learn how your boss wants to access the itinerary, as well as their likes and dislikes.


What do they want to prioritize: their comfort and convenience, or saving company money? (Your boss's preference here will help guide borderline decisions that come with your planning.)
Do they prefer digital itineraries or paper itineraries?
What kind of seats do they like?
How much detail do they want in the itinerary?

, Sometimes your colleagues have already had experience with your boss's travel. They may know things your boss finds essential in an itinerary.

, Whether your boss is traveling for business or pleasure, you will want them to be as prepared as they can possibly be. Think about the impression they'll want to make on the people they meet and what they'll need to make that impression.

, If the trip requires air travel, itâs best to investigate multiple options for the best flight and/or hotel. Kayak will cross-compare a variety of travel sites to pinpoint not only the best current price, but also if the price is likely to get higher or lower if you were to purchase the ticket or reservation later. If your boss has indicated a preference for convenience, you may end up choosing a slightly pricier flight that suits your boss's needs.

, Travel agents can generally contribute more of their know-how if the trip involves indirect flights, international travel, or refundable tickets.

airport arrival time (at least two hours before the scheduled flight)
flight's airline
flight's number
departure and arrival airports
departure and arrival times
departure and arrival gates
destination hotel with address and check-out time
car rental information.
The packet should also have phone numbers for the hotel, the airline, and the travel agent (if applicable).
Include copies of your bossâs passport and driverâs license.

You want your boss to be able to find this important information easily. , If your boss is not renting a car, they'll need a way to get around.


Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have gotten popular and suit cost-sensitive or more casual bosses just fine. That said, some airports do not permit ride-sharing services.
For a boss seeking to spend on a more luxurious ride, limolink.com allows you to reserve a chauffeured limo or car service in cities worldwide. If your boss wants a towncar rather than a limo, research the boss's destination to see what local companies offer towncar service.

, A schedule with specific meeting agendas and times should be handily accessible to your boss.


Consider scheduling cocktail hour or dinner meetings if your boss does well in more social settings.
Helpful additions to the daily agendas are weather predictions, a map of the area around the destination, and relevant driving directions.

If you are familiar with your bossâs tastes, include information on nearby restaurants or events that your boss may enjoy during this free time. , A simple folder could do the trick. , Think about all the times you traveled and ran into unexpected weather, delays, and other events beyond your control. Your boss may very well face travel hiccups, but you can work to be prepared if not everything in the itinerary goes to plan.

, You want everybody to be on the same page when your boss is out of the office.

, Before the boss goes on the trip, briefly introduce yourself over the phone to the destination hotelâs front desk and any relevant staff members involved in meetings your boss is set to attend. This is your chance to get a sense of what your boss is walking into, and perhaps if certain meetings are likely to go long or start on time.

, Sooner or later you will feel you need to speak to your boss about the situation. Once you are fully prepared, and confident you have a clear view of the situation, ask to meet with your boss for a chat. When you go to talk to them, try to be very diplomatic and don't accuse them of favouritism.If you feel like you are being constantly overlooked, it's immeasurably better to ask what you can do to contribute more and get more of these assignments.It is better to take a positive approach, making the situation about you and not the person you perceive to be treated as the favourite.
You could ask ""what can I do to gain more responsibilities?""
Keep your cool and hold back any emotions when talking to the boss.
Identify changes you can make in the first instance.

, After you have spoken to your boss hopefully you will see things begin to change. Try to maintain objectivity while making yourself available to meet your boss half-way. It can be difficult to change a work culture, and it takes effort from everyone. Be sure to put in lots of effort to engage with your boss and the rest of your team.Favouritism can develop through habit so it's important that you help create the conditions for new habits to develop., One way to take positive action that isn't just tackling the issue with favouritism, is to find someone you like and respect in the company to act as a mentor or champion. Having someone support you and be happy to talk up your skills will help you counteract the negativity you get from your boss.A mentor can give you an advice and an essential second opinion. They can also act as an advocate if necessary., If there has been little or no noticeable improvement and you have given your boss every chance to improve the situation, it may be time to approach HR.For this, you will need to produce evidence to support your complaint, so bring the record you have kept.

Maintain your professionalism.,
Stay humble and professional with colleagues.,
Avoid the benefits of being the favourite.",How to Deal With a Boss Showing Favoritism3," It's one thing if you perceive your boss to have an unfair favourite in the company, but it can be an equally difficult situation to deal with if you find yourself being treated as the favourite. Becoming too close with your boss can lead to numerous problems and it is important to maintain your professionalism at all times. Avoid becoming too familiar and remember that she is your boss first and foremost., Being the favourite can provoke negative feelings from your colleagues, and can strain relationships. Combat this by making every effort to involve your colleagues and praise them to your boss. Doing this will gently encourage her to show appreciation to more people in your team than just you. By doing this you are showing your colleagues that you are still part of the team, while also demonstrating humility and appreciation of the work of others.Making a point of highlighting the skills and potentials of colleagues can also be a good way to help develop a better functioning work environment.
You're helping your boss manage the workload, but also helping your colleagues have the opportunity to prove themselves., If you are the favourite it's important you do not in any way take advantage of, or abuse, this situation. In fact, you should be wary of potentially undeserved benefits. If you're given a big office ahead of more senior colleagues don't be afraid to mention to your boss that you're not sure if you have earned it. Casually saying ""what did I do to deserve this?"" can encourage your boss to re-evaluate her approach.Clear signs of favouritism and undue benefits are likely to prompt suspicion and even gossip amongst your colleagues.

Avoid office gossip surrounding this person.
Don't go over this person's head if you have an issue. Address it politely with him or her to resolve the issue together instead of trying to sidestep him or her.;
,


You may prefer phone or face-to-face conversation, but a first-time boss may be right out of college and prefer email, texting, Skype, social networking or some other means of communicating.
Embrace the new communication methods, but don't be afraid to implement your own preferences as well. Finding a balance will be the key to happiness for both you and your new boss.

, Popping into his office for something when that person has a regularly-scheduled meeting that he is already running late to will only cause internal resentment toward you. Instead, observe and learn his routine to be more timely with your interaction with that person.

, Let the new boss know that you are available if he has any questions, but don't give advice without being asked. You don't want to come off as trying too hard or for making yourself seem better than that person.

, A first-time boss is bound to screw up at some point, but by keeping a paper trail of your correspondence, requests and more, you can ensure that the problem is not your fault or that the blame cannot be shifted back to you.

, By showing that you are a top performer, you can work to not be micromanaged as critically as others who are not holding up quite as well as you are.

Learn your bossâs moods and subtle clues.,
Determine your boss's priorities.",How to Build a Good Relationship with Your Manager1," Learn about your bossâs general background.

Where did he or she go to school?
What did he or she study?
When is your bossâs birthday?
Is your boss married? Have a family?
What are your bossâs hobbies?
Avoid asking questions about religion, politics, and relationships.;
, Acquire this valuable information by observing your boss and talking to co-workers who have been working at your job for longer than you. Is your boss a hand-on boss or is he or she less formal and involved? Is your boss a workaholic who arrives at the office early and leaves the office late each day? Does your boss get easily overwhelmed and stressed out?, Through observation and time, you will be able to tell when your boss is stressed out or crunched for time. It is invaluable that you learn to read your boss. For example, if your boss is walking in a hurry with his or her eyes starring straight ahead, you will know it is not a good time to propose a new business idea., Unless your boss is the CEO of the company, your boss also has a boss. Ask your boss questions about his or responsibilities, expectations, and goals.Ask the following questions to your boss: What are your long-term career goals? What do you hope to accomplish in your current role? What can I do to make your job easier?

Determine if your bossâs communication style is formal or informal.,
Ask how often your boss wants to communicate with you.,
Clarify expectations.",How to Build a Good Relationship with Your Manager2," Every boss is different. Ask your boss if he or she prefers to keep in touch through face-to-face meetings, email, text, phone, or maybe Skype., If you have a quick question can you just walk into your bossâs office and ask or do you need to make an appointment? The communication protocol is specific to your boss. Ask your boss, his or her secretary, or a co-worker if your communication relationship is supposed to be formal or informal.


Always be respectful and professional even if you have an informal communication relationship with your boss.

, Find out if your boss wants updates multiple times throughout the day, at a certain time each day, once a week, or through scheduled meetings., Right away, you and your boss need to discuss your job specifications and what is expected of you. It is when this information is unclear or unspoken that conflict and disappointment arise.

"
"
Show your boss respect.,
Don't make excuses.,
Ask for feedback.,
Lend a helping hand.,
Make requests, not complaints.,
Avoid office politics and drama.",How to Build a Good Relationship with Your Manager3," Your boss is your superior and has more authority in the company than you do. Behave in a respectful manner toward your boss. Be conscious of your tone, word choices, and attitude.Your boss has earned his or her position. Acting disrespectful toward your boss will only hurt your relationship and threaten your job security.
A good rule of thumb is to pause briefly before you blurt something out. This pause will give you the opportunity to adjust your tone and the way you are going to respond to your boss.
Instead of saying with a snippy attitude something like, ""that's not part of my job description,"" when your boss asks you to do something new, try saying, ""I will try my best with this new task.""

, Do what you say you are going to do. If you fail to complete an assignment in the time that was allocated, own up to your failure. A boss will respect you much more if you are just honest verses always having an excuse on handIt is better to under promise and then to over deliver instead of the opposite.
Don't take on more than you know you can handle in an attempt to impress your boss.
Instead of saying, ""I am late because there was traffic,"" try saying, ""I apologize for my tardiness today, and I will leave earlier for work from now on.""

, By asking for feedback, you are showing your boss that you are open-minded, willing to improve, and truly invested in your job. Feedback from your superior will only help you do your job better.

, Lending a helping hand when one is needed, even when it is by doing something that is not part of your job, will demonstrate to your boss that you are a team player and not lazy., It is far more professional to make requests and offer potential solutions opposed to just venting about things you don't like or don't think work. Be part of the solution, not the problem.Complaints come off as whiny and childish.
Requests come off as solution-focused and respectful.
Instead of saying, ""I can't stand working with the marketing department! They are so inefficient!"" Try saying, ""I would like some help trying to figure out how to communicate more efficiently with the marketing department.""

, Getting involved with office politics, drama, and personal conflicts in the workplace is a surefire way to show your boss how unprofessional you are. Do not do anything that causes tension or makes the workplace unpleasant. If you find yourself in a situation where you are involved in sort of conflict, discreetly discuss and end the issue with the person or people involved and more on."
"
Ask for one-on-one training.,
Talk about a common interest.Everyone has a hot button.,
Strike up conversations during lunch/smoke/coffee breaks.,
Join a club or group which your boss is a member.,
Meet your boss outside work, if appropriate.,
Know your employer's policy on fraternization.,
Don't give in to a false sense of security.,
Evaluate whether your friendship is interfering with your job.,
Learn to say ""no"".There is a clear and unequal distribution of power when you make friends with a higher up.",How to Be Friends With a Boss," There's no better way to grasp the attention of your boss, and forge a bond with him, than by requesting that he teach you a skill he's good at. People frequently express themselves through work, so seeing your boss in action can open your eyes to a side of him you've never seen.


Let's say it's company-wide knowledge that your boss is the best at brainstorming creative projects. Pull him aside one day and tell him how you really admire this skill, and would he mind giving you a few pointers so that you can improve your creative pitches. He'll likely be flattered by your humble approach, and such a connection point could be the start of a new friendship.;
, When you press it, this person comes alive and he or she can talk at length until everyone around them turns blue. You must be prepared to talk about the things which are of your boss's interest whenever possible. Your status will be even more elevated if you have a similar interest or have in-depth knowledge about this particular hobby or passion.


Do you know your boss is a full-fledged basketball fanatic? Saying something like âWhat about those Celtics?â can easily ignite a lively conversation and a budding friendship.

, If possible try to be with your boss during lunch/smoke breaks. Time your breaks so that it matches with your boss's. For initial few days you can try to make it look 'accidental'. Take advantage of this 'accidental' time together to generate your boss's interest in you.


Be careful with this one, you donât want to come off as a slacker during work hours. Make sure you are not taking the same amount of breaks as your boss: you arenât the head honcho; h/she is.

, If you can join a club or group which your boss is a member of you will get many opportunities to work together on things outside work and spend time together. This will help you both to understand each other better and bring you closer to your boss.


Examples of potential organizations might be Toastmasters International or a reputable organization within your industry.
The next time you step into your boss's office, check to see if there are any awards or other paraphernalia indicating which clubs and organizations she's associated with. Broach the subject that you have been looking to get involved and ask about the dynamics of the organization.
Only do this if you are genuinely interested in the specific club. Otherwise, you will probably not be dedicated and active in the group.

, Look for opportunities to meet your boss outside work. Create such opportunities by inviting your boss to your parties, social gatherings or charitable events. These meetings outside work will help you in developing a solid bond with your boss.


Another way to reinforce your friendship outside the office is to âfriendâ your boss on Facebook.This strategy gives you an idea of your bossâs outside interests and gives you a host of conversational openers (i.e. âYour granddaughter is a beauty!â).

, Some companies have strict rules about managerial staff buddying up to underlings. Be aware of your company policy before you try to make friends with your boss.


Monitor the climate of your work environment. Does your boss engage in miscellaneous conversation with her subordinates? Do you ever see her show up to gatherings outside the office? Is she friends with other support staff on social networks? Knowing the answer to these questions in addition to your employerâs take on fraternization can help you to determine if being friends wth your boss is acceptable in your line of work.
While some companies build a wall up around management, others encourage connections between supervisors and their employees.When people work with people they like, the culture, energy, and morale in the office is enhanced.

, Being able to have a successful friendship with your boss depends on the two of you being able to carefully separate business from pleasure. No matter how strong your bond, he is still the boss. You will still be evaluated, criticized and potentially fired if you do not meet performance standards or break company policy.


If you are truly interested in making friends with your boss, do so because you get along with and find this person intriguing. Buddying up to a supervisor as a power play for your career is insincere and could hurt you more if your boss gets a whiff of your motives., Being best buds with an administrator will stimulate talk. If your friendship is well known among the staff, you can trust that every single move you make in the company will be scrutinized.Did you get a promotion because youâre the bossâs BFF? Did you get the cushy corner office due to favoritism? Count on water cooler talk to frequently be focused on you if you make friends with the head honcho.


Getting closer to your boss may cause you to develop enemies with other subordinates. They may try to sabotage your position, or ex-communicate you from the inside loop.
If you have a leadership role of your own, or must bridge relationships with many other employees, being buddy-buddy with your boss might impede those working relationships. Consider whether this friendship is worth it to you and your career growth.

, Will your boss/bestie pass off extra work to you? Will she expect you to be on her side even when the whole office is against her?


Recognize when you are being taken advantage of and know that you can exert your rights. Reconsider the friendship if you are constantly having to put aside your values and priorities for your new friend.

Showing up early lets the boss know you are devoted to your job and that he or she can rely on you to take accountability for your actions. Not needing the boss to monitor you will reflect positively on you. If you do show up late, make sure youâre truly apologetic and show that you know that this is not acceptable.


If you aim to get to work extra early, then youâll end up showing up at least on time if you face any unexpected challenges.
Getting to work early will also make you do better at your job, because youâll feel like you have more time to accomplish all of your daily tasks.;
, One way to please your boss is to show up to work with a smile on your face and to whistle while you work, so to speak. Though not every part of your job may be thrilling, you should make an effort to be optimistic, to talk about the things you love about your job, and to avoid complaining about it as much as you can. You donât want to be the person who brings people down and you donât want your boss to think that youâre unhappy with your work.


Of course, if you have a real problem, then you should bring it up as respectfully as possible. But as a rule, you should try to keep things fun and upbeat. You want your energy to make people feel better, not worse.
It can be easy to fall into complaining with your coworkers. If they start complaining around you, try to kindly change the subject or excuse yourself from the situation. Bad energy can be infectious.

, Your boss will be very pleased if he knows you to be neat and organized. You want to make sure that your files are in order, that your emails, desktop, and any other important documents are all in place, and that you never have to spend more than thirty seconds looking for a paper that you need. If youâre sloppy with your work, then this will show that you donât care about your work as much as you should, and that youâre not invested in giving it your all.


Plus, being neat and organized will save you a ton of time and will make your work easier. Itâs a win-win situation.
If you spend just 10 minutes a day making sure your things are organized at the end of the day, then you should be in great shape.
If your boss doesnât think youâre organized, then heâll be less likely to ask you to help out on additional projects or to think youâre trustworthy.

, Keep your boss happy by not being one of the employees that spreads gossip, causes problems among coworkers, or requires disciplinary action. Don't give your boss any reason to associate you with any negativity in the workplace. If your coworkers are gossiping, try to kindly say something nice about the person theyâre talking about or to say you have some work to do. You donât have to be confrontational about it, but you should avoid agreeing with or spreading rumors about the people you work with.


If you hear any gossip about your boss, then you should back away as quickly as you can. You certainly donât want your boss to hear about it, or heâll never be able to fully trust you.
Try to spend more time with the coworkers who donât have a reputation for gossiping. Though you want to be friendly to everyone, you donât want to be associated with the office gossips.

, Accept requests to help out with extra duties in the office like assisting with special projects or lending a new employee a hand with a particularly difficult client. Your boss will appreciate your initiative and your ability to multitask. Be sure all of your regular responsibilities have been met before taking on extra work.


You want to be known as the person your boss can count on when something extra needs to be done, even if itâs last minute.

, To be a model employee and to make your boss happy, you should always be the first to accept new challenges. Get used to the idea that thereâs more than one way to do things and that you can succeed at tasks you didnât think you were capable of completing. Instead of being hesitant or making excuses when youâre presented with a new challenge, you should be excited about it, ask the questions you need to ask, and show that youâre eager to get started.


You want your boss to think of you first when thereâs a new and exciting task to complete. You donât want him to overlook you because youâll put up too much of a fight when it comes to doing something new.
If your boss asks for volunteers for a new project, be the first to have your hand up. Show that youâre up to the task and that you donât need to be persuaded to try something new.
Plus, your job can get stale if youâre doing the same thing day after day. If youâre always taking on new challenges, then youâll be more likely to actually enjoy the work you do.

, One way to be a model employee is to look professional at all times. Whether your office has a strict dress code or a more casual one, itâs important not to show up looking too casual or out of place. Take the time to shower, groom yourself, and put on clean, well-fitting clothes before you walk into the workplace. This shows that your job is important to you and that you want to look your best and to do your best. If you canât put in the basic effort needed to look nice at work, then this tells your boss that you donât take your job seriously.


If your job has special âcasualâ days, or holiday-themed dress days, try to participate. You want to show that you take your job seriously but that you also want to have some fun, when it is allowed.
Another reason to give yourself plenty of time to get ready for work is so that you look put together when you walk into the workplace.

, One way to please your boss that can benefit both of you is by asking for his advice or opinion on an issue or with a particular client and then implementing his words of wisdom. This allows you to benefit from your boss' knowledge and experience and lets the boss know that you value what she thinks. This also shows that youâre always looking for ways to improve at your job and that youâre always trying to do the best job possible.


Asking questions also shows your boss that youâre comfortable admitting that you donât know everything and that youâre self-aware enough to know when to ask for help.
Just make sure to ask questions at the right time, so your boss has time to take them seriously. Asking a series of off-topic questions at a company meeting wonât give you the results you want.

, Take constructive criticism given during performance reviews or meetings to heart and strive to improve areas of your job that aren't your strongest. Making yourself better and improving areas of your job performance that need work will show your boss your dedication. You want your boss to see that you really care about your job and that you see that thereâs room for you to grow. If youâre stubborn or rude, then your boss will think that youâre set in your ways and have no room for improvement.


Remember that feedback isnât meant to hurt you or make you feel inadequate; itâs there to help you improve as a worker.
Even if not all of the feedback you get is useful, make sure to be receptive, upbeat, and thankful for it. Donât make your boss feel like you resent him for being honest with you.

, You donât need to be BFF with your boss to please him or her. In fact, trying to get too buddy buddy can lead to complications or can make it feel like youâre trying a little too hard to make a good impression. Instead, you should smile at your boss, say hello, stop to make small talk, and get to know a few things about him that you can ask about, such as the names of his children or his favorite hobbies. Keep things light and friendly around your boss and avoid getting into disagreements or being curt or thoughtless at all costs.


If your boss is obviously busy or frazzled, then you donât need to try to make small talk or be extra friendly. As you get to know your boss, youâll become more aware of his or her moods.
Try to be friendly but professional in your correspondence, such as emails, as well.

, Speak up if you have an idea about how something could be improved or done differently in the workplace. Present your idea to your boss in an organized way when he has time to listen and discuss it with you. Even if your idea is not implemented, your effort will show your boss your initiative and a desire to improve the workplace as a whole.


If you offer suggestions from time to time, then your boss will see that youâre thinking about the company at large and that you really have a stake in the success of the company.
Just make sure that you offer your suggestions privately so your boss doesnât feel as if heâs being attacked or chastised in front of other employees.

, To truly please your boss, you have to show that youâre self-motivated and that youâre the kind of employee who takes initiative in his work. You shouldnât only go above and beyond when youâre asked to, but should take steps that will impress your boss and improve your company on your own. You want your boss to think that you can work well on your own without being supervised and that youâll continue to succeed at your job even if he or she is out of the office.


At the end of the day, you should be motivated to do the best you can because you love the work you do and want to do your best, not just to impress your boss.
If your boss is out for the day, he should trust you to continue to do your work and to even encourage other employees to do their best.

, You want to have a reputation for working well with others and to be able to collaborate effectively. Your boss should think that he can put you in any team and that youâll be able to thrive no matter what. Learn to respectfully disagree, share your ideas without being pushy, and to truly listen to what your co-workers have to say and on taking their suggestions seriously. Make people feel comfortable sharing their ideas with you and make sure that everyone is contributing when you work on a team project.


Though you may feel like itâll be better if you do all of the work yourself, this will make other team members feel left out and will give them the impression that you donât trust them.
Make sure to be open-minded and to consider all aspects of a situation before making a decision. You may think you have your mind made up when you begin a project, but you should be open to and considerate of whatever your co-workers think.

, If you want to have a strong relationship with your boss, then you have to know how to communicate your feelings well and how to tell your boss what youâre thinking in the most respectful way possible. If you disagree with something, you canât act like you know the right thing to do; instead, kindly suggest or ask if things could be done a bit differently. Make sure youâre articulate, speak clearly, and make your main point crystal clear.


If you need to talk to your boss about something important, set up a meeting with him. If you try to tell him some important information in the halls or when heâs obviously busy, then he wonât be as receptive to what you have to say.
You have to be able to not only communicate with your boss, but to also communicate with co-workers, customers, and anyone else in the office. Strong communication is a quality of a stellar employee.

, Show your boss that you're committed to your job and that you want to be the best by advancing your education and job skills. Enroll in courses or skill building programs and attend seminars that focus on learning new aspects of your position and career. These programs can make you better at your job and may even make the work more fun. Additionally, a lot of companies will pay you more if you have more training.


You can also make sure to stay current in your field by continuing to take courses to refresh your memory about certain protocol or just to make sure you have the most up-to-date training on how to use technology in your workplace.
Advancing your education will please your boss because heâll see that you really want to continue to improve at the work you do instead of being stuck in the same role.

, You will please your boss if you go above and beyond and attend as many âextra-curricularâ company events as possible. Whether these are birthday parties, happy hours, team building activities, team volunteering events, or other special activities, you should make an effort to attend as many of these as you can to show your commitment to your work. Of course, you have a life outside of work and canât be expected to attend every event, but you should make an effort to be there as much as you can.


If you really want to take the extra leap, then you can even organize some of these events yourself. This shows initiative and that your job really means a lot to you.
Plus, if you attend more work-related activities outside of work, this will give you more of an opportunity to bond with your boss on a new level and to put yourself out there.

, Another way to go above and beyond and to impress your boss is to work on building strong relationships with your coworkers. You donât need to be best friends with them or to hang out with them outside of work all the time, but you should be friendly with them and make an effort to get to know them a bit. If you have a reputation for keeping to yourself and not opening up to anyone, then your boss will think that youâre only looking out for yourself.


Even if youâre really busy outside of work or more on the shy side, it doesnât take much of an effort to smile at your co-workers, to make a bit of small talk, and to ask them about their families, their vacations, or their pets.
Plus, you want your boss to see that youâre an important part of the office team. If your co-workers love you and the office wouldnât be the same without you, youâre much more likely to keep your job when itâs time to downsize. If no one in the office even knows who you are, youâre less likely to seem crucial to the team.

, To really go above and beyond and please your boss, you have to be able to think outside the box. The times are changing quickly, and chances are that your job and company will be changing, too, especially if youâve been at the same place for a while. You have to be able to accept whatever changes may come your way and to come up with new and creative ideas for how to solve old problems.


You donât want to be known as the guy who is stuck in the same old ways when the company around him is changing. Instead, you should be the first person to come up with innovations and to follow them through.
If youâve been doing something the same old way for five years, then itâs time to think about whether or not there are faster, more original, or more effective ways to get your job done. If youâve found an innovative way to address an old problem and it really works, share it with your coworkers so they know what to do, too.

, In order to please your boss, you have to show that youâre a person he or she can depend on when itâs time to do some extra work. Whether youâre suddenly in the middle of a complete work crisis or a project is just taking way longer than expected, you should be there to offer to help out, to stay late, or to complete the extra work that needs to be done. This shows your boss that youâre really committed to your job instead of just being the person who counts down the hours until quitting time every day.


Of course, you shouldnât be the person who gets taken advantage of every single time. Make sure your boss acknowledges your efforts and gives you extra compensation when you deserve it.
When you do offer to help out and do more work, make sure you do it enthusiastically instead of begrudgingly. If youâre offering to help but would rather go home and watch TV, then your boss will be able to see it in your face.

, Ultimately, the best way for you to please your boss, and to have the best time on the job, is to truly love the work that you do. If youâre really committed to the mission of your company and love your job, then you wonât have to try so hard to please your boss because being positive and having great ideas will come naturally to you. If you feel like youâre faking it whenever you have to muster enthusiasm for your job, then this may mean that itâs time to consider finding a more fulfilling line of work.


Even if you donât love all of your job, itâs important to find something to be excited about. If youâre absolutely miserable at work, then your boss will be able to tell.
If you love your job, youâll be more likely to offer meaningful suggestions, to give great feedback, and to be a great person to work with.

Use ""Madam Chair"" to address a female chair.,
Use ""chair"" or ""chairperson"" to be gender-neutral.,
Address the woman by a different gender-neutral title accepted by the chaired body.,
Use ""chairman"" as a gender-neutral term.",How to Address a Female Chairperson1," The woman's job title is ""chairwoman"" (or, in some organizations, her title may actually be ""chairman"") but the proper form of address is ""Madam Chair"" or ""Madam Chairwoman.""The term ""chairwoman"" makes the clear distinction that a female is fulfilling the role.


Check whether the woman holding the office will allow this form of address or if a gender-neutral alternative should be used instead.;
, In the United States, ""chairperson"" may be more accepted as a gender-neutral title than elsewhere, such as the United Kingdom.


When addressing her during formal meetings, you should not use the second person. In other words, you should not say, ""Madam Chair, do you think we shouldâ¦?"" but rather ""Does the chair feel we shouldâ¦?"", Depending on the organization, a person serving as chair could be referred to as ""president,"" ""speaker,"" ""presiding officer,"" ""moderator,"" or ""convener."" The United States Senate, for example, uses the title ""President."" The U.S. House of Representatives, on the other hand, has a Speaker of the House who serves as its chair.


A female Speaker may be addressed as ""Madam Speaker.""

, Many people feel that the term ""chairman"" and other terms like it are not meant to designate a gender but a role or office. As such, it can be acceptable to use that term even to refer to a woman.


In fact, Robert's Rules of Order (which are considered the gold standard for business meeting etiquette) defend this use as appropriate when the organization's bylaws specify the title ""Chairman"" for the holder of the chair."
"
Address the envelope appropriately.,
Use consistency in the header and body.,
Use the proper level of formality in your greeting.",How to Address a Female Chairperson2," Include the woman's full name, any titles or honorifics (such as J.D. or PhD), and her full chair title.


For example, you may write ""Dr. Rose Smith, Chair of the Search Committee."" You can also use ""Rose Smith, Chairwoman.""
It is also permissible to use other honorifics such as Dr., Judge, or Honorable.

, Use the same name and title on the envelope and on the header of the letter itself.


The exception is the greeting line, which can be shorter and omit lengthier titles if necessary.

, In a very formal business letter, always use the person's complete title in the address and greeting line.


A formal letter may begin with ""Dear Chair Smith,"" or ""Dear Madam Chair.""
A less formal letter, email, or memo may omit the full title. You may write ""Dear Dr. Smith"" or ""Dear Ms. Smith,"" but avoid ""Mrs."" unless you have been specifically instructed otherwise by the chair herself. When in doubt, err on the side of a more formal address.
These rules are not hard and fast, since different women may have different preferences. Follow the woman's personal preference if she would rather be addressed as ""Mrs."" or something else.

"
"
Use the title she prefers if you know it.,
Check with colleagues.,
Check websites and newsletters.,
Ask her.",How to Address a Female Chairperson3," Some female chairs prefer to just be called ""chair."" Others might like chairwoman or another honorific. Some female chairs even prefer the term ""chairman"" and do not care about its gendered distinction.Do what you can to determine what she prefers, if at all possible. There are several ways you can try to find out her preference.

, Perhaps there are other people who are more acquainted with the chair and can tell you what she prefers to be called, or alternately, what most people tend to call her.


Following norms is generally a good idea to avoid sticking your foot in your mouth or saying something awkward. If there is a general consensus at the company or organization to call her Chair Smith, for example, it would be out of place for you to suddenly call her Chairwoman Smith.

, If the chair has been in charge very long, the odds are good that she has penned a letter, article, statement, or other writing in which she may have signed her name with her title.


Start with a simple internet search of her name. If you cannot find any information about her, look for information about other women who have held her position.

, If you have a sufficiently well-acquainted relationship, don't be afraid to ask her what she prefers to be called. Alternately, she may correct you when you address her; listen to what she says and follow her lead.


Keep in mind that the title you use to address her may change depending on the occasion. In formal situations, for example a big board meeting, you may address her as Chairwoman Smith or Madam Chairwoman,but in other situations she may prefer to be called by her first name. However, never assume that it is ok to refer to her by a less formal name; she is your superior. Be sure that she is the one who tells you she would prefer a more intimate and less formal name, and only use it in the settings where she has clearly made it permissible.

Listen to what they say.,
Pay attention to what they bring to the table.,

Pay attention to how they treat you, off the bat.,
Look at what they keep.,
Look at where they are.,
Look at who is employed.,

Ask a prospective manager what his/her managerial experience entails.",How to Avoid Problem Bosses,"


Pay very close attention the line of conversation and the tone of voice they use during the interview. Does the boss bring up irrelevant matters not related to the company or the job you are seeking? Do they ramble on about personal experiences that have nothing to do with the job? Does he/she constantly interrupt you while you are trying to make a valid point? Do they go on and on about the previous employee who couldnât seem to do anything right for them? These are all signs of an inexperienced and/or poorly trained manager.;
, A good manager will have with him/her a job description detailing your prospective duties within the organization and will be enthusiastic in going over these duties with you. Failure to have this on hand is a sure sign of a manager who is ill prepared to handle the demands/interests of the organization.


A good manager should be well prepared for the interview. Also, scripted interviews, where a manager will ask you interview questions from a pre-printed sheet, show lack of preparation/interest in getting the right answers from you. A terrifically good manager will know exactly what to ask of you as regards his/her specific needs.

, A weak handshake and none to very limited eye contact during the interview is not indicative of a boss interested in either you, or the job you are applying for. If your circumstances permit, turn down any forthcoming job offer from any outwardly hostile, or any seemingly bored, individual.

, Are they appropriately dressed for the interview? Is she a âPradaâ lady, wear too much makeup, or inappropriately revealing clothing? Is he a fastidious type with overly manicured hands, excessive jewelry (watches, bracelets, rings, etc.) or a slouchy, sloppy type with a stain on his tie? A good manager will have a polished, professional or office casual appearance without being either excessive (a fashion plate) or negligent (an outright slob) in his/her overall attire.

, Does the manager stop to take a personal phone call on his/her cell? Does he/she wink at you as they go on and on about last night's outing with a friend? Does he/she keep you waiting for any excessive length of time for your interview past the time you were supposed to meet? â this is not only rude and perversely controlling from the start, but a sure sign of trouble.

, If interviewing in their office, take note of what is in that office. Barbie doll or Star Wars collections? A vast collection of family pictures? An excessive collection of recreational trophies? Utter chaos and paper everywhere? Conversely, is it a cold, sterile office devoid of character or warmth? The ideal manager will have a neatly organized office with moderate personal effects.

, In keeping with the above, do surroundings seem shoddy, (cheap, old or damaged furniture) in contrast to the company profile? A successful company that truly cares about its employees will have middle to top of the line equipment (computers, copiers, etc.) and newer, ergonomically correct furnishings for its employees. Cheap, old, or damaged equipment and dirty surroundings is a sure sign the company is in financial straits, if not actually sinking. Ask for a tour of the place. More importantly, ask to see where you will be working and what equipment you will be using.

, Do employees seem disgruntled? Are they sitting around the watercooler gossiping at length, while you wait to be seen? Either these employees have too much time on their hands (poor staffing practices, lack of proper management) or they have stopped caring for a company that doesnât care about them. Either way, itâs a bad sign.

, A good manager will be on the ball about the company he/she works for and what is expected of you. He/she will have a good grasp of company policies and procedures, core values and mission statement.

, How long have they been managing employees? How many employees? How much training have they had? Often, the worst managers are those who have been placed in a position without any priors: formal training, education, and/or experience in management. Too often, such impromptu managers seem to think the way to be a boss is to boss their employees â all the live-long day, with repeated or redundant demands. Companies too cheap to hire the proper management end up paying in the long run with a costly, higher turnover of employees. Youâre more than just a pancake; continue with your job search.

Set up an initial meeting.,
Decide what the best way to communicate is.,
Establish how often your boss would like updates from you.,
Ask for feedback.",How to Communicate with Your Boss1," Use this as an opportunity to ask about where your job fits in the larger scheme of the company, how your job performance is going to be measured, and whether your boss expects your job responsibilities to change over time.Agree on your job responsibilities and establish expectations and common objectives. Ask open-ended questions like: âHow do you see my job responsibilities shifting over time?â or âHow does my role fit in with the larger structure of the company?â;
, Ask your boss whether they prefer you contact them via email, phone, in person, or a mixture of any of the above for everyday conversations or updates. Inquire about whether they would prefer to communicate differently in the case of a work âemergency,â and clarify what would count as such an emergency. This could range from you not being able to meet a deadline to you being sick and not being able to come into the office on a given day.


Perhaps your boss prefers you email them if you have a brief question but set up a meeting if youâd like to discuss a project idea or a larger goal. Whatever the case, be flexible and adapt to their communication style.

, Some supervisors will like a daily update, whereas others will prefer an update at the end of each week or even bi-monthly. Follow your bossâ guidance and update them as they have stated they would prefer.


You could bring this up by asking: âI can update you on a daily, weekly, or bi-monthly basis. What would work best for you?â

, Once you have gotten settled into the routine of your job, itâs wise to ask for feedback every so often. This could take the form of a quick monthly meeting. Your boss may be juggling many responsibilities, but they will likely be willing to take a few minutes out of their busy schedule to inform you on how they view your progress.

"
"
Communicate with your boss on a regular basis.,
Show your value.,
Prepare for your interactions.",How to Communicate with Your Boss2," Be proactive and donât wait until thereâs a problem to talk to your boss, as this could negatively tinge your interactions. Instead, give your boss selective updates about your progress.

, Keep your conversations with your boss positive by talking about results. If you were able to meet your quarterly goal, bring this to the attention of your boss. Talk to them about how you achieved these results. For example, this may have been a mixture of effective teamwork, leadership, and strategic risk-taking. This will show your boss that you are driven and can complete your tasks.

, Determine just what exactly you want to get out of talking with your boss. Be it in person, via email, or by phone, your communication should have a specified purpose. Since your boss likely has a lot on their plate, they will appreciate an employee who knows what they want and how to ask for it.If you have a problem youâre not sure how to solve, outline what parts of the problem you are unsure about and bring these points up to your boss in order.If you want to ask for a raise, prepare what youâre going to say ahead of time. Type out an outline of your value points and rehearse how youâll talk about the topic at least a few days in advance.

"
"
Be an active listener.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Be aware of your body language.,
Ask for help or advice.,
Build rapport.,
Be respectful.,
Be professional.",How to Communicate with Your Boss3," Focus entirely on what your boss is saying. Listen attentively and remain silent while your boss is speaking, except for occasionally asking a clear, constructive question.Avoid responding immediately. Instead, practice reflective listening by periodically paraphrasing what your boss says, which will reduce potential for miscommunication and show them that youâre engaged in the conversation.Encourage a cooperative conversation by refraining from using silence to form your next point, which can make the conversation seem competitive and put your boss on edge. Instead, be in the moment and adapt to the natural nuances of the conversation., Asking open questions will allow you to approach the conversation with a cooperative, rather than a competitive, mindset. Questions that start with the 5Wâs (who, what, where, when, why) or with âhowâ can lead to thoughtful responses. Questions that start with âshould,â âis,â or âwouldâ can lead to limited responses.Remember that the goal is to ask questions that show you are paying attention and are thinking critically about the information your boss is conveying to you.
Refrain from asking âmultiple-choiceâ questions. In other words, donât ask an open question like âWhatâs the best way to present this information?â and follow it up with potential answers like âIs it PowerPoint, Word, Prezi?â You want to give your boss the opportunity to think and respond mindfully, as this will allow you to learn the most from your interaction., Active listening, and in turn a comfortable conversation, will involve leaning slightly forward, nodding occasionally, and making eye contact. Refrain from fidgeting or adopting closed body positions like crossing your arms., Doing this every so often can make your boss feel that their input is appreciated. More importantly, it shows that you value their opinion. It can also allow them to see you collaboratively work out a solution to a problem or question., Your boss will likely appreciate being asked how their weekend was, so be the one who does the asking. Go to lunch with your boss if possible and inquire about their interests and hobbies outside of work. Building rapport is an essential part of building strong interpersonal relations, so start today.At the same time, limit the amount of personal details you give out. Be friendly, but remember that your boss is not your friend. Whereas brief, non-work related updates are acceptable and even encouraged, refrain from providing lengthy descriptions of your weekend or explaining to them everything you do with your free time.

, Your boss is in their position because of a combination of expertise, training, and experience. Part of your job expectation is to be respectful to them. You can do this by maintaining a courteous tone, listening attentively, considering your bossâ point of view, and remembering your role prior to your interactions so as not to overstep your bounds.


You can still constructively disagree with your boss. A respectful disagreement will involve being clear, focused, and calm instead of confrontational or apologetic. Donât embarrass or make demands of your boss, and choose the right timing - for example, ask for a meeting when you know your boss wonât be busy., You can do this by avoiding participating in office gossip, being on time, dressing professionally, and staying focused on your job so that you can meet deadlines."

Pull the paper release lever forward if you do not plan to use the typewriter for awhile.,
Store your typewriter at the right temperature.",How to Use a Typewriter," The first thing you want to do with a typewriter is insert the paper. Take a standard size sheet of white paper and fit it into the typewriter.Look at the top of your typewriter. There should be a long, cylinder running across the typewriter. This is the roller. Just behind the roller is a small, flat angled piece of machinery that tilts back slightly. This is the paper table. You want to place the top of your sheet of paper between the roller and paper table.
There should be a small knob on the side of the roller. This is the roller knob. Turn this knob counter clockwise. This should feed the paper into to the roller. You should keep turning the knob until the top of the paper is just behind the keys.;
, The carriage of a typewriter is a part of the typewriter that moves the roller across the page. Each time you hit a key, the carriage moves the roller slightly to the left. You want to start off with the carriage as far to the left as the typewriter will allow. Slide the roller over to the left. The carriage should stop the roller at the appropriate place to set the margins., Now you can begin typing. Typing on a typewriter is somewhat tricky. Each key causes a stamp to strike against the paper. You want to type hard enough to make the letters stamp on in a clear fashion. You should also type somewhat slowly if you've never used a typewriter before. There is no backspace key, so corrections can take a long time. Try to make as little typos as possible., Eventually, you will hear the typewriter make a dinging noise. This means you have reached the end of the line you're currently writing on. You need to return the carriage to begin a new line.On one side of your typewriter, there will be a carriage return lever. This is a metallic lever. Carriage level either move downward or to the side. Press your carriage level in the correct direction for your typewriter. This should get the paper to transfer to the next line.
From here, push the roller to the right until the carriage stops it. Then, resume typing.

, You may make some typos when using a typewriter. As there is no backspace key on a typewriter, correcting these errors can be somewhat time consuming.You can use whiteout to remove the unwanted letter or phrase. Then, feed the paper back into the roller until you reach the line where the typo occurred. Adjust the roller until the paper is positioned in such a way that you can type the correct letter or sentence over the whited out portion of the page.
Some typewriters have an autocorrect feature that functions somewhat like a backspace key. If your typewriter has an autocorrect feature, you can use this to fix typos. You can usually only correct single letter typos, however. If you notice you typed the wrong letter, hit the autocorrect key. The typewriter will move back a space and imprint a whited out version of that letter over the black ink. You can then type the correct letter.

, When you've finished a page, you can remove the paper. Turn the knob near the roller clockwise until the paper comes out of the typewriter., If you want an electronic backup of the work you did on a typewriter, use a scanner to scan all the pages you typed. If you do not have a scanner, you can go to a local print shop and use one there for a small fee. You can then email the pages to yourself so you have a copy., Typewriters need to be kept clean in order to be functional. Before you start the process of cleaning your typewriter, gather the following supplies:Cotton rags
Gentle liquid cleanser
Hard-bristled paint brushes
A vacuum with a crevice tool.
Car wax
Typewriter oil

, To start, clean the surface of the typewriter with a gentle cleanser. You do not want to use anything with too many chemicals, especially if your typewriter is older. Dilute the cleanser with water slightly before you begin the cleaning process.Dab a rag in the cleanser. Scrub the exterior of the typewriter until you've removed all dust and debris. Go slowly and use a light amount of force on the typewriter. Typewriters are often old machines, and you do not want to accidentally scratch the surface or damage the paint during the cleaning process.
From here, take your hard-bristled paint brushes. Dust your typewriter's keys, removing any loose paint or debris from the keys. Take the crevice tool of your vacuum and run it over the keyboards, gently inserting the tool between the spaces in the keys. This will suck up any debris or dust that fell inside the typewriter while you were dusting the keys.

, Typewriter oil, which you can buy online or at some hardware stores, can be used to keep the typewriter running smoothly. Use a very small amount of oil. A small amount of lubrication goes a long way. Squeeze a moderate amount of oil onto the moving parts, as well as the interior parts of the keys.Be very careful not to use too much. Less than a drop of oil should be sufficient.

, If you want your typewriter to look shiny and new after you clean it, use some car wax to give it a nice gleam. Place some car polish on a rag and buff it into the exterior of the typewriter until it looks shiny and new.As with cleaning your typewriter, be gentle. Harsh movements can cause you to damage the typewriter's exterior, so do not buff with a lot of force.

, You want to make sure your typewriter is exposed to as little dust and debris as possible. Too much dust and outside material can affect a typewriter's functionality. When you're not using the typewriter, cover it.If your typewriter has a carrying case, place it inside when it's not in use.
If you don't have a carrying case, you can keep your typewriter in a drawer or another small, enclosed space free of dirt and debris.

, The paper release lever is the lever that you press on some typewriters to release the paper. Not all typewriters have a release lever, but if yours does, you should pull it forward when the typewriter is out of use. If you do not use your typewriter frequently, it's a good idea to leave the lever forward. If the lever is left closed for a long time, this can cause flat spots to appear on the roller. Flat spots can crinkle the paper and cause a messy appearance when you're typing., Typewriters are susceptible to damage if they're not stored properly. Typewriters should be stored at temperatures around 40 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep your typewriter in an air conditioned room during the hot months. If you do not have air conditioning, store you typewriter in the coolest room in your home, such as the basement.Cool temperature can also have a negative affect on a typewriter. Do not store your typewriter in a cold place, like your garage, during the winter. Make sure your typewriter stays inside where it is warm.

If you can figure out some practical ideas for saving money and review these ideas with your boss, your interest in the welfare of the company will leave a good impression.When mentioning your ideas, do so in a way that is confident without being pushy. Ask your boss for a few minutes of his or her time in advance instead of expecting your boss to make time for on demand. Explain your idea thoroughly and answer any questions your boss might have. If he or she decides to turn it down, be a good sport about the rejection.;
, More specifically, take a good look at your boss' skill set and determine what weaknesses your boss has. Improve your own abilities within areas your boss does not excel in and make your skills known in a way that is helpful instead of condescending.


At no time should your attitude suggest a sense of superiority. You need to act as though your behavior is purely for your boss' sake and not merely for your own.

, It can be a risky move, but if your boss senses that you have enough confidence to be more than a ""yes man"" or ""yes woman,"" your boss may treat you as someone whose opinion can be trusted.


Make sure that your opinions are always well-considered, especially when you disagree with your boss. Just about everyone has an opinion, but if you want to make sure that yours will be treated seriously, you need to take the time and energy to have an informed opinion which adequately considers all aspects of the situation.

, Master skills and tasks that are not specifically included in your job description when those tasks can assist you and your boss in the workplace.


In particular, focus on those tasks that are often overlooked by other employees.Even taking control of small, menial tasks can be important if the productivity of the workplace improves as a result. For instance, when you get to the workplace in the morning, take the initiative to regulate the temperature in the space to normal, start the coffee machine, or start up any other machines that will be required throughout the course of the day.
You should also take the initiative to accept formal projects and tasks outside of your original job description. As long as the job is one that you feel confident about handling, taking it on can show your boss just how versatile you are an how eager you are to contribute to the company as much as possible.

, If a certain task is more difficult than your current skills and experiences have prepared you for, come straight out and warn your boss. You should always show an eagerness to learn, but if your current base of knowledge is not as broad as your boss seems to think it is, you need to let him or her know so that potential problems might be avoided down the line.


Similarly, you should always be honest about your mistakes after you make them. Never try to push the blame onto others or hide the errors you make in the workplace from your boss.

, Competition can be fierce, and keeping up with the rest of the industry is an important part of a company's survival. When you see news related to your industry, pass it along to your boss and co-workers. Doing so demonstrates the seriousness you have regarding the company's success.

, Make sure that you are prepared for your job before you show up to work. Any information or resources you need for a meeting should be gathered well before the meeting starts. Additionally, you should consider preparing what you need for the next day before you leave for the day.

, This can be particularly beneficial if you are a new employee. Research the company and its mission beforehand so that you have as thorough an understanding as possible. This information will allow you to ask your boss informed questions about the nature of your work and the company as a whole.On the flip side, you want to make sure that you do not ask too many obvious questions. If you ask a question you can easily find the answer to on your own, you could appear as though you lack the drive to research and inform yourself on your own.

, Students take notes so that they can review the material later and better understand it. In the same way, you, as an employee, should also take notes to review later. A great time to do this is at meetings. Doing so lets your boss know that you are paying attention and eager to be as knowledgeable as possible concerning your job.


If you are new to the job, you might also want to take notes about daily tasks and responsibilities as you learn them. The act of note-taking may not be noticed, but the results of your efforts will likely be seen.

, Finish tasks ahead of time whenever possible. If you are asked to set your own deadline, it is better to give a slight overestimate so that you can confidently meet the goal.


If you overestimate your deadline, try not to do so in a terribly dramatic way. For instance, if you know that you can get the task done in three days, don't tell your boss that you need three weeks. The fact that you have finished early will still look good, but after a while, your boss may realize that you are grossly overestimating your deadlines and may simply start to assign more suitable deadlines for you.

, Even if you feel busy and over-worked already, if your boss hands you an assignment, take it. Rearrange your schedule as needed to complete the work done according to importance. If you are unsure how important a task should be, you can ask your boss for help prioritizing the workload.


The exception to this rule, as mentioned previously in this article, is accepting an assignment when you know that you do not have the experience to complete it (especially if there is a deadline). If you come clean with your boss about your lack of experience and he or she still finds you suitable for the job, then you should still consider accepting it.

, Few things look worse to a boss than someone who fails to follow or proves to be unreliable.


While you should avoid turning down assignments that are offered to you, if you absolutely know that you cannot complete it no matter what you do, be honest and tell your boss. It would be better to turn down the occasional task than it would be to vow that you'll get it done only to let everyone down in the end.

, Do the tasks assigned to you and try to avoid doing unrelated tasks at work, like surfing the Internet or catching up on your social media profiles. When you do have down time, do things that improve your image as an employee, like reading books that are related to the job or those that may otherwise keep your mind sharp.

, While the quality of your work matters more than the quantity, spending as few as an extra 15 minutes before and after work can leave your boss with the impression that you are serious and eager to complete the tasks assigned to you.


As a general rule, try to beat your boss to the workplace and leave after he or she has already left. This is not always possible, of course, but doing this often enough can leave a good impression and earn you some respect.

, Ideally, your workspace should look well-used but organized. You should keep some materials out on the desk to show that you are actively working, but if things look too cluttered or messy, it might appear as though you are too disorganized to be productive.


Keep the materials you need out during the day. Tidy everything up before you leave.

, More specifically, dress for the job you want, not the job you have. A serious appearance will cause your boss to view you as someone who takes your job seriously.


Here's another rule of thumb to consider: unless your workplace policy is already as formal as can be, dress one step above your workplace dress code. If T-shirts and jeans are acceptable, wear a nice polo shirt and khakis. If polo shirts and khakis are acceptable, wear dress slacks and a dress shirt. The exception to this, of course, is if your workplace requires an employee uniform. In that case, keep your uniform neat, clean, and ironed as necessary.

, When you need to get out of your seat for any reason, you should move from Point A to Point B at a fast pace. Moving around quickly makes it seem as though you are busy, and looking busy will help you look more like a serious employee.

, Interact with your boss on a frequent basis and make sure that those interactions have a positive tone. If your boss can spare the time, you may even consider requesting a 10-minute to 20-minute review session at the end of each week.


Accept any criticism your boss dishes out. If your boss criticizes something about the way you work, do not get defensive or upset. Instead, evaluate that criticism and determine if there is some truth behind it. Take any advice your boss gave you on correcting your flaws and put that advice into practice.
Pay attention to personal details. You do not need to pry into your boss's personal life, but when personal details are offered, remember them. Periodically mention these details when talking to your boss. Doing so can demonstrate your overall ability to pay attention to the little things.

, You need to be on good terms with your co-workers. Get to know them during lunch breaks and other down times. Make sure that you know how they do their jobs so that you can work with them in the future.


Be careful about becoming too involved with your co-workers, though. Casual chit-chat that eats into company time looks bad, and if you develop personal relationships with your co-workers, you run the risk of letting personal disagreements ooze into the workplace and disrupt the flow of work life.

, If you worked on a project with other coworkers who did a lot of the work, let your boss know how valuable those others were if your boss happens to compliment you on doing the job well.

, If a co-worker is having difficulty with his or her work, offer your assistance, especially if the problem deals with an area of expertise you feel comfortable with. Doing this shows both a healthy dose of team spirit as well as a broad knowledge base and skill set.


Make sure that you do not gloat or put yourself above others after helping them, though. You need to be helpful and confident, yet also humble.

, Emergencies and other serious problems may need to take precedence, but everyday difficulties and sources of stress from your life outside of the workplace should remain outside of the workplace. Show your boss that when you are at work, your are there both physically and mentally., A positive attitude makes a big difference in your own productivity, and it also helps improve workplace morale. If you are consistently positive while on the job, your boss is sure to notice and appreciate it.

Summarize and re-state your request.,
Sign off respectfully.,
Be prepared for a ânoâ.",How to Ask for a Raise in Email1," Your request should be polite and respectful, but thereâs no need to be extremely formal. Your enthusiasm for the job should be clear. Open your email by addressing your boss as you normally would (e.g., âHi, Maryâ)., Your boss should be able to understand what you are asking for right off the bat. Give your email a subject line that clearly addresses what the message is about. Summarize your request in the opening paragraph.For example, give your email a subject line like âRequesting Salary Adjustment.â
Your opening paragraph could be something like: âI have been working hard over the past two years to make valuable contributions to the company. In light of everything I have accomplished, I would like to request a raise to $35,200 per year. This is in line with current average salaries for editorial assistants working in the academic publishing industry in the Chicago area.â

, Once you have made your opening statement, support your request with examples of ways that you have helped the company. Cite a few specific goals you have for improving your performance and continuing to help the company moving forward., Your request should be as positive as possible. Donât complain about how hard you are working for so little pay, or about how long it has been since your last raise. Also avoid implying or outright stating that you will leave if you donât get what you want.


Instead, focus on your accomplishments.

Present the results and any relevant information to your boss to reinforce your shortened meeting experiment.",How to Persuade Your Boss to Shorten Meetings," Be absolutely sure that you're not the only one finding the meetings long and tediousââsome people have a predisposed dislike of meetings in all shapes and forms, and this is a hindrance of its own sort. Meetings should be productive, interactive and enjoyable ways to bring everyone together. If that is not what is happening in your meetings and they are in fact unproductive time-suckers, then you're probably right to go about seeking shortened ones.


Carefully gauge the reactions of your co-workers after meetings and time the meetings for a few weeks, to be sure it's not just you who finds the meetings long.
Observe pre- and post-meeting behaviors. Make your own observations. Are people consistently getting to the meeting late? Are people on time but end up making idle chit chat while waiting for the boss or presenter to appear? Do you see people lingering around the table after the meeting is over or are participants anxiously keeping an eye on watches and tearing out the door the moment the meeting's closed? Most telling of all, are people actually saying they can't abide the long meetings they're subjected to?
Look for any time-wasting behaviors not only before and after the meeting, but also during meetings. Are many meetings conducted like a runaway train where the moderator has no control and conversations often run off-subject? Are people with no stake in the outcome adding their two cent's worth a lot of the time? Is there any grandstanding or tangential talk going on?;
, Perhaps some well-placed examples of good meeting strategies will help you present a solid case when seeking to persuade your boss to hold shorter meetings. This can be achieved with background research on the best ways to run a meeting. The strategies may differ according to your industry, workplace practices and teamwork requirements, but there are some basic elements to making any meeting more efficient and less time-consuming:


Focus on ways to reduce time-consuming meetings, and how to have more short ones in place of the longer ones. This approach can be a good way to compromise with a boss who expresses a preference for lots of regular meetings. You could suggest that only one or two of these meetings be long, while the rest are just short check-ins or catch-ups.
Consider whether the meetings are being held just because of tradition. This entrenched reason for holding a meeting can be a real hold-up because it seems sacrosanct. Yet, it makes sense to point out that a meeting has become long due merely to tradition, as this might be the first time anyone's noticed or had the courage to say so.
While you don't want to pretend you know more than your boss, it can sometimes be helpful to analyze the cost of holding long meetings. Talk to co-workers about what long meetings cost them in terms of time and meeting deadlines. Look at how much of the discussion in meetings is rambling or socializing dressed up as work. Even look at time spent getting to and from the meeting. As for your boss, the time spent in meetings can be considerableââfor example, the Executive Time Use Project that showed chief executives spend about a third of work time in meetings.That's an average of around 18 hours a week, not accounting for phone calls, business lunches and time spent preparing for meetings. Highlighting these costs might help to persuade your boss to start looking at ways to reduce long meeting times.
Consider who needs to be at meetings. Again, tradition can dictate that more people than those actually needed end up at the meeting. The more there, the more prolonged a meeting can be.
Socializing-at-work is often hidden under the guise of meetings. Management guru, the late Peter Drucker, once commented that ""One either meets or one worksââone cannot do both at the same time."" Perhaps do some research into ways to bring together the team that don't involve meetings but still fulfill this desire to congregate, such as Friday afternoon nibbles and drinks. It's much nicer to acknowledge the socializing for what it is than to hide behind a meeting faÃ§ade.

, You're more likely to be persuasive if you present your boss with suggested solutions for ways to achieve shorter meetings than if you simply rock up complaining about meeting length interrupting your daily pondering. Using the research outcomes from the previous step to help you customize some ideas for making your workplace's meetings more effective and less lengthy. As well as tailoring ideas specific to your workplace, some general ideas you might find useful include:


Only ask participants to meetings, especially where it is clear that a lot of attendees are not contributing for lack of knowledge of the area, or interest in it.
Review the usefulness of regular meetings that have become fixtures (it's ""that time of the week"") rather than motivators or useful. Suggest their removal or minimization.
Avoid meetings that simply rubber-stamp a decision that has already been agreed upon. If it's about sharing information, do so using emails or bulletins.
Hold one monthly update meeting with everyone in the workplace to consolidate previously separate update meetingsââunless the updates are sensitive, regardless of rank or branch, an update is an update.
Schedule definite times for meetings and always start on time. Make it known by starting on time, every time that latecomers will miss the details and will have to catch up on missed information using their own initiative after the meeting. Moreover, the scheduled length for the meeting can be kept to by use of a timer. When it goes off, that's it.
Create set agendas or purpose lists for meetings if they're not already in use. This causes meeting holders to think about the ""why"" of the meeting rather than the fact of a meeting. After making an agenda, have them question the items on the agenda to see if they really need a meeting. Another use for an agenda or list is to only hold a meeting when the agenda or list reach a set pointââprior to that, there should be no cause for a meeting. Don't wait too long thoughââan overly long agenda can promote length and muddle!
Donât let meeting participants sit down. If you really want to think outside the box, institute a âno sitting downâ policy. No one gets too comfortable, which prompts participants to want to get down to business and move forward.
Try canceling a regular meeting to see if anybody misses it or if the workload misses it.

, Look at both the negative and positive elements of your boss' style in meetings. One of the keys to ""managing up"" is to focus on the strengths of your boss, to find the ways in which you can help to make these shine more, all while subtly discouraging the weaknesses. For example, your boss might be convinced that winging it in meetings is perfectly fine but as a result of the lack of an agenda, the meetings tend to ramble all over the place. Yet, your boss appears to be very good at getting to the nub of the issue through listening to others' input. This lets you try to find a way of introducing an agenda to all meetings to keep topics on track, stating that it'd help everyone running a meeting (and thereby not singling out your boss). And perhaps you could suggest splitting longer meetings into a series of shorter ones that focus on a single topic only, which can keep your boss on topic too. You can sell this one to your boss as being about ensuring that only those people most likely to contribute something relevant, useful or inspirational will attend the individual meetings, rather than having attendees distract the whole meeting from its purpose.

, Be sure that your boss has some spare time set aside for you to talk effectively together. If this means getting a slot in his or her calendar, pencil it in. And, if you intend to have someone else accompany you, be careful. Unless you're sure he or she will add value, consider that your boss might feel outnumbered and could see this as ""ganging up"" or as personal criticism. On the other hand, in an environment that highly values team approaches, turning up with another team member might be perceived as confirming a commonly agreed upon problem in need of fixing.

, It can be challenging to raise a subject about which your boss is meant to be the authority and the last word but faint heart never won anything, so be prepared. Begin by explaining that while you appreciate the opportunities to get together with others in the workplace to discuss, you're concerned that the meeting culture of the workplace appears to favour very lengthy meetings (do your best to use language that distances the ""blame"" for the long meetings from your boss). Briefly explain how this impacts you and some of the co-workers you've talked to. Express your desire for shorter meetings in order to give you and your fellow co-workers more time to get work done. At this point, be polite and ask your boss if he or she is interested in hearing about some of your researched ideas for ways to make meetings more dynamic and less lengthy. Take your cue from the boss' answer.


Always remember your position in relation to your boss. It's hard managing people well and some bosses are easily threatened if they perceive that the staff feel that they could manage better. You'll go far by showing deference and respect along with your initiative. Be genuine, earnest and thoughtful. Most of all, understand that your boss may well feel the same as you but feels compelled for one reason or other to continue things the way they areââyou might actually be presenting him or her with an employee-initiated solution, so it may eventually work out for both of you.
Be ready for questions. Don't see questions defensively, even if they're used that way. Instead, view questions as an opportunity to explore the ideas together in greater depth, as part of your persuasion. And where possible, the more you can get your boss to think he or she came up with some of the solutions, the more likely they'll be adopted, so don't talk too muchââand never interrupt. This is simply common courtesy that any person, boss or not, deserves.
As much as possible, focus on the benefits of short meetings. Compile a list on paper if you can't rememberââif needed, you can always offer to leave the list with your boss for reflection. In fact, if you're aware that your boss prefers to read things first and then discuss, make sure you have a few decently presented proposals on paper to ease the passage of your ideas. In this case, you can always suggest picking up the conversation after your boss has had an opportunity to read your information.
Since persuasion of a boss is about ""managing up"", doing some reading on how to be a successful ""entrepreneur"" can be helpful. Such learning is never wasted!

, If there are some things your boss agrees would be a good idea, take the initiative to do whatever you can to help. This will reduce the burden on your boss, shows your willingness to follow through on your ideas and lets you monitor progress.


Take any suggestions of your boss about shortening meeting times and run with them. Ideas with the boss' buy-in are already good-to-go and should be given priority. Support your boss and be willing to show that you do so openly.
Offer to develop the draft of a new meetings policy or trial approach that will incorporate the ideas your boss has agreed upon with you. The beauty of offering to do this is that you get some room to be more creative during its development because it's just a ""draft"" and your boss has to okay it anyway. This lets you be bold and introduce any other like-ideas that perhaps weren't explored during your discussion with the boss. Explain that whatever you develop will be short, purposeful and considerate of all staff. When you do prepare it, provide a clear set of rules for meetings using the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple soothsayer) method. Number the meeting rules and write them in short, concise sentences, using descriptive but easy-to-understand language.
As part of your offer, suggest that you continue discussing with staff to bring on board their suggestions. Be careful though, as you don't want to give the boss the impression this is turning into a mammoth circus of a project. Let your boss see that this won't take much time and won't consume you or other employees. For example, you could say that you'll use an online survey which gives anonymous results to gain insight from co-workers in a non-disruptive way. Help sell this idea by saying that you'll be looking for even better ideas for shortening meetings from the employees, showing that this means their buy-in.
Look at the many possible alternatives to meetings. These are endless and again, dependent on your workplace needs, but some ideas include: make a phone/Skype call or a conference call, get feedback using online surveys, have a fun event after hours, send out updates by email or intranet update, use bulletin boards, create posters, etc. If you need input to an idea, one way to avoid a meeting is to leave a white board in an open office for brainstorming-at-your-convenience, allowing employees to pop in and out during the day as they please. This frees up meeting time and is good for the more reticent employees who can leave their idea unnoticed.

, This will help to solidify the determination to shorten meetings and to find more creative ways to share information within the workplace. It also ensures that your efforts have the blessing of the boss.

, To help your boss see that the meetings are shorter and that productivity and creativity have benefited as a result, offer to track the results. Keep data on the amount of meetings being held before and after, as well as data on meeting duration and the level of satisfaction of meeting attendees and employees-in-general. Make use of survey tools and charts or graphs to compile this information easily. Again, this isn't meant to be a burden, just do enough to prove the point that less and shorter meetings are benefiting everyone. Gathering enough relevant data might take a few weeks or months, depending on the type of work your workplace does. Keep your boss posted so that he or she knows you haven't forgotten.


Ask employees to complete a survey surrounding their efficiency level after meeting times have been shortened. You donât have to survey everyone after every meeting. Instead retrieve a random sampling to generate results.
Request suggestions on how to improve the process. Continue to ask for suggestions and ideas from employees. Ideas generated before policy implementation may change as time goes onââfor example, the notion of being able to wrap up meetings in 15 minutes may have looked like a good idea beforehand, but perhaps youâve found that you really need 30 minutes to truly accomplish anything.

, Show how shorter meetings have improved staff morale, increased effectiveness and stimulated new ways of approaching the sharing of ideas and information. While discussing this verbally is the easiest approach, perhaps compile all of the relevant data into a list or chart for quick perusalââkeep it clear and short. As well, create any documentation (such as ""Our workplace's effective meetings guidelines"") and visual reminders (such as a poster stating ""The 3 rules of an effective meeting"") needed to help ensure that shorter meetings are going to continue to the be the way forward in your workplace. Ultimately, realize that it takes time to change company culture but with the boss' support and evidence of the benefits, it'll soon begin to change for the better.

Write down anything that you think is significant. For example, consider whether you have:Successfully completed any important projects.
Saved the company money or helped increase revenue.
Performed above and beyond what was expected of you.
Gotten positive feedback from clients, customers, or supervisors.

, Find out about the typical salary range of other people in similar positions, with similar levels of experience, to yours. Ask around among colleagues to get an idea of how much they are making. You can also consult with your companyâs Human Resources department, or check out websites like http://www.payscale.com/ or https://www.glassdoor.com/., Once you have done your research, decide on a reasonable amount to ask for. Make your target salary as specific as possible.Managers are more receptive to specific numbers than ballpark figures. For example, rather than giving a range from $40,000-$45,000, ask for $43,500.
Keep in mind that the average raise is between 1% and 5% of an employeeâs current salary. Factor this in when deciding on your target salary.

If so, you should probably wait until things calm down before approaching them to ask for a raise., If revenues are up, clients are happy, and the company is stable or expanding, this is probably a great time to ask for a raise. Avoid asking at a time when the budget is tight. Itâs almost certainly the wrong time to ask for a raise if layoffs are happening., It makes sense to time your request with an increase or shift in your responsibilities.

If you really want to improve your relationship with your boss instead of waiting for things to get worse, then the best thing you can do is ask your boss if you can schedule a time to talk and be honest about your feelings while maintaining your professionalism. Once you have face time with your boss, make eye contact, speak clearly, and let him or her know what the problem is.Make sure you focus on how your problem is with working with your boss, not your actual boss or some aspect of his or her personality. Talk about how you're having trouble communicating, which is making it more difficult to meet objectives, or say something else about how you're struggling to meet deadlines because of changing expectations. Frame the conversation so it sounds like you want your company to succeed, which can only happen if you and your boss work better together.
It's important to choose your words carefully. Avoid any personal attacks that may offend your boss, and focus on discussing your work.
Picking a time to talk in advance will keep your boss from being caught off guard and will give the situation the seriousness that it deserves.;
, If you really want to improve your relationship with your boss, then you should work with your boss to improve the state of your company, instead of against your boss. Though it may feel good to make your boss look stupid at a meeting or to send a passive-aggressive email to your boss, in the long run, this won't do any good for your relationship and it won't make you feel any better. Furthermore, making your relationship with your boss even worse will make it harder to get your work done, and at the end of the day, nothing is more counterproductive than that.Help your boss achieve his goals by being helpful, present, and supportive. Even if he's difficult to deal with, your life will be easier if you move with the grain instead of against it.

, Keeping track of all of your conversations, whether it's through emails or memos, will help you be on top of your situation with your boss. Doing so will be helpful for two reasons. First, having a record or everything your boss said will help you in the event that your boss gives you confusing instructions or claims he or she didn't say something that he or she really said; you can use the written communication as evidence. Second, having a record of everything your boss says to you can be helpful if your relationship is so problematic that you want to discuss the situation with a supervisor; in that case, you'll have written proof that something is off.If you're really struggling to communicate with your boss, then try to make sure that all of your communication happens in front of someone else, so that you have evidence of what happened if your boss tries to deny it.
Document everything that you feel is relevant to your concerns with your boss. You may want to purchase a pocket planner so that you can enter the issues on the appropriate dates. Keep this private. You don't want to pull put the planner and scribble notes in front of him because that will cause more anger. You are keeping notes for your own sake, so that you have all your concerns backed up with facts.

, Another way to improve your relationship with your boss is to keep an eye out for problems that may arise, and to react to them with preparation and forethought. If you know that there was a bad traffic accident on the freeway and that your boss is going to come in late, try to delay the meeting until he gets there, or start it off for him. If you know your boss is going to be angry after meeting with a difficult client, give him or her some space instead of bringing up something upsetting, which may start an argument.If you know that your boss has difficulty accomplishing a certain task, try to keep yourself relatively free so you can be there to help out.

, Even if your boss becomes emotional, you want to maintain your professional manner so that he cannot use anything against you. Note that your boss may become even more aggravated by your calm and professional demeanor, and if this is the case, explain to your boss that you would like to continue the conversation, but the last thing you want is to upset him, so suggest picking up the issue at a later time. If you lose your cool, your boss can blame you, even if youâre upset over something completely legitimate.If you find yourself getting emotional in the middle of a conversation, excuse yourself and ask to resume the conversation at a later time.
If you hear yourself raising your voice, stop, slow down, and take a few deep breaths. If you canât keep the conversation at a normal level, then you should resume it later.

, Of course you have issues that you may want to discuss personally, but if he feels that you are criticizing him, he may turn the tables and place the focus on you. If this is the case, be professional. Listen to his concerns and tell him that you appreciate his feedback and that you will work on the issues, and then politely return to the problems you have. Donât get defensive or ignore anything he is telling you.


In fact, it can be helpful to ask yourself if youâre doing everything you can correctly before you start a conversation with your boss. You may be having problems with your boss because you have been doing something wrong without realizing it. Itâs best to anticipate anything your boss might say, such as the fact that youâre always late or that your reports need to be proofread more, before you start the conversation. Otherwise, you may be taken aback.
Donât interrupt your boss and wait for him to finish giving his feedback. You donât want him to think that youâre above listening to him.

, If your boss is characteristically difficult to handle, not just for you but for others, then the likelihood of him changing is minimal. If this is the case, use the opportunity to simply make him aware of your issues. At least he cannot say that he was never informed of your concerns. Though you canât change your boss or his personality, hopefully talking to your boss will send him on the path to improvement. Furthermore, you can work on improving your relationship without changing your boss.


You and your boss may just not be compatible as people. If this is the case, then youâll have to find a new way to operate together unless you feel like you have exhausted all of your resources. Sometimes, you may have to accept your differences first before you move on.

, Maintain a calm demeanor and be prepared to listen to any gripes or lectures that he or she may want to share with you. Donât use vulgar language or personal attacks, and donât be lewd or say anything you would say if you were fighting with a close friend. Remember that you have a professional relationship with this person, not a personal relationship. Even if your boss starts being unprofessional, donât use that as an excuse to follow suit.


If you have something specific to say to your boss, you may even want to write it down or rehearse it first to make sure that it comes off as professional. You donât want to start saying something and then realize that youâre stepping out of your bounds halfway through your conversation.

, Not only will this cause hostility between you and your boss, but your bossâs boss may refer you back to your boss, which may result in an even more unreceptive situation. You should go over your bossâs head if you feel like you have tried everything with your boss but nothing has worked. Additionally, you can go over your bossâs head if you feel that your boss is being sexually inappropriate, discriminating against you based on your age, gender, race, or another external factor, and that further action needs to be taken outside of your bossâs power.


If you go over your bossâs head at the first sign of a conflict, then you will cause irreparable damage to your relationship. If you can try talking to your boss before talking to someone else, it can save your relationship, as well as your happiness at work.

, If you feel like you have tried everything on your own and need to talk to someone higher up, then itâs time to arrange a meeting with a supervisor to discuss the problems youâre having with your boss. Thereâs no point in delaying the inevitable if you feel like you really canât work together with your boss. If youâve tried everything and know that your relationship has reached a dead end, then itâs time to talk to your supervisor about the situation. Donât be nervous, and stick to discussing the facts instead of getting emotional. The more concrete examples you have, the more respect youâll get.


Make sure you use professional language and avoid bad-mouthing your boss in front of your supervisor. You donât want to say something that makes your supervisor lose respect for you, too. Remember that you want to look like the calm, reasonable one, and that your boss is the one who has been causing all the problems.

, If you truly feel that youâve been discriminated against because of your age, race, gender, or something else beyond your control, then it may be time to take action. You can consult the EEOC for free, or seek out an employee attorney for a fee if you think youâve been discriminated against and are in a protected class. Donât be nervous about taking this measure if this is whatâs happening; though it wonât be pleasant, this may be the best way to meet your needs.

If youâve witnessed fraud at your company and want to take action, remember that the False Claims Act requires you to first file your claim before you disclose it publicly.

, One option that isnât as extreme as leaving your company but which can make you a lot happier at your workplace is to see if you can be transferred to a different department, or even transferred to a different boss. If youâre truly having trouble with your boss and your supervisors or other people at the company completely understand where youâre coming from, then they may be willing to accommodate your needs. If you make it pretty clear that you wonât be able to stay on if youâre stuck with your current boss, in spite of how much you like the company, then they may be able to find an arrangement that makes you happy.


Of course, all of this depends on your workplace culture and if such arrangements are typically â or even occasionally â made at your workplace. Do your research and see if such a thing has been done before, and look out for tips on how to proceed. Of course, you should try to find this out without letting everyone know about the particular situation you find yourself in.

, Unfortunately, when it comes to todayâs job market, good jobs can be few and far between, depending on the industry youâre working in. Before you decide to go on the job market again or to leave your current company, you should ask yourself if itâs really worth it for you to make this change. If your job is causing you mental and physical pain and you really feel like you canât be there another day and keep your sanity, then it may really be time to leave. However, if youâre just mildly annoyed or frustrated, you may want to hold off, or you may want to explore your options before you resign.


Of course, if your boss is being inappropriate, discriminating against you, or doing other unreasonable things, then thereâs no question about it: you have to leave.
Ideally, you should be able to look for new work while maintaining your current position. Being employed will make you a more appealing candidate for other companies.

, Though you may be bursting at the seams to leave your current work situation, you have to diligently do your research before you take a new offer. If youâre too desperate to leave, you may jump at the chance to work at a new company, even if it ends up not being a good fit. You could end up at a company with a boss who is even more difficult (though this may be hard to imagine now), and will only make your own working life even worse. Itâs important to take the time and to make sure that youâre leaving a hostile environment for a comfortable one before you make the transition.


As you interview for a new position, make sure you talk to other people at the company and get a strong sense of what your new boss will be like before you accept an offer. Though you wonât know 100% what your new boss or job will be like until you start working there, you should follow your gut to see if something is off.
Though you may be rushing to take on a new offer because itâll mean you will have to spend less time at your current job, resist the temptation to take something that doesnât feel quite right just because it means youâll get to leave your current difficult boss. Tell yourself that itâs a worthy time investment to search for a place where you can truly be happy in the long run.

Narrowing down what it is you want will help you approach the task of asking for it. Ask yourself multiple questions when preparing to negotiate with your boss. Knowing exactly what you want will prevent stuttering, struggling with your words, repeating things multiple times, and being un-knowledgable with your question.;
, For example, if you are asking for a higher salary, find out what the going rate is for the work you do. Once you do your research, and know the answers to these and other questions, you'll know the facts about what other people are paid, and you'll be much better prepared to ask for what you want. It always helps to keep a notepad handy when you are doing your research; you can write down whatever you need to remember. A few questions to ask yourself are:


How much do your friends get paid for the same work or job?
Does the amount that your friends get depend on the level of responsibility they have?

, You have to plan what you are going to say, and how you will say it. Practice this often; after all, you definitely do not want to sound nosy or arrogant when speaking to your boss about a raise. It's best to write a little speech and practice it a lot when you are at home. The more you practice your tone and words, the more of a chance you will have to get a 'yes'.

, It's not really a good idea to start with the big one and end with the little ones when negotiating. Instead, start with a few small request and work your way up to the big guy. You have a better possibility of getting what you want if you start small. Remember, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.""

, This is usually not a time for the grand show of modesty. You must emphasize your accomplishments and abilities and point out why it is that you deserve what you are asking for.

, Most of the time, it is dreadfully important to listen to your boss... If you don't, you'll probably say the wrong thing and it will become a quick ""No."" Concentrate on what your boss says when you are not speaking. Do not interrupt. Do not speak until he is finished speaking, or unless he asks you a question. It is vital that you listen closely.

, You might be presented with a counteroffer, an offer that is made in response to your offer. You don't have to respond to it right away. Take your time, and think about it. Is this offer good for you? Will it meet your needs?


You don't have to give your answer immediately; wait a little bit before coming back to the counteroffer. Your boss might think that you feel deprived if you don't respond right away.

, If your boss doesn't jump at your first request and his counteroffer doesn't suit you, think about other ways you can make the scenario a win-win. If you want more vacation time, for example, and he isn't able or willing to provide it, consider foregoing a raise in exchange for more time off each year. Or if you are suggesting that you give up a certain responsibility that you don't think should be on your plate, ask him about taking on something else in its place, instead. If you can both ""win"" at the end in one way or another, you're more likely to get his support for your proposal.

, The best time to iron out the details isn't always during your initial negotiation or acceptance. You can agree to something general and then go away to iron out the details. Once you have an outline of what you believe you've both agreed to, send it to your boss via email and double check that you're on the same page.

, Once both you and your boss have reached an agreement, it's a good idea to put that final offer in writing. Both of you should sign the document. This will prevent and future mis-understandings or mis-communications with your boss about what was actually agreed upon. Still, an old-fashioned handshake might come in handy, especially if your boss has a good memory.

, Make sure you have done your research well and you know what you will be talking about and the risks you might be taking. If you're not sure about these or yourself, postpone the negotiation until you are prepared.

, Arguing or using intimidating behavior is going to hinder, not help. Remember that the central process of negotiation is the discussion with others to reach an agreement or compromise. It's aÂ dialogue, not a monologue!

, Listen carefully to what the other person said, is saying, or has to say. Speak when its your turn to speak, or you will fail in proper communication. If you interrupt the other person just to make a point or add something, your boss will probably be making a decision ahead of time... and its probably ""NO"".

, If you are trying to act 'tough' because you think it will make the discussion go your way, well, be prepared to hear that it's not. Be the most confident version of yourself, other than trying to be the macho-man that you think will win every time.


Do not get aggressive at your boss if things don't go your way. If you feel yourself getting angry, ask for a few minutes break away from your boss to recollect yourself.

, Each person has different preferences as to what media they prefer to work withas well as when during the day they prefer to deal with interruptions. Do you use IM, drop into their office or send them an e-mail or a phone call? It's critically important for you to understand your boss' preferences in this area.

, If there is a crisis affecting a client, how soon should you notify your boss? Should you make a call at 2 AM to let them know or just email them?

, Again, each boss has different preferences in how much information they need, what types of information, when, etc. Here are some alternatives.


Just present the problem, they'll solve it. Generally, however, bosses don't want to see problems without a recommended solution.
Present the problem and a single recommended solution. Some bosses will trust your judgment and go with your recommendation. Other bosses want to see alternatives along with pros and cons.
Present the problem and several alternative solutions, along with a recommendation. For some bosses, alternative solutions are just a waste of effort, but other bosses demand to see alternatives.

,


Some people want to see just a few summary numbers, while others want pages and pages, seen from a variety of angles.
For format, some want to see pie charts, bar charts with trends, etc. to summarize data at a high level. Others will want to see tables of numbers. Also watch to see what font and point size your boss and peers prefer.

, For some bosses, going to a meeting without a notebook and pen is considered an insult. A 6"" by 9"" spiral bound notebook is a good idea, since it keeps notes in date order and you avoid filing. One notebook serves for all your meetings.

, For some odd reason, this topic is frequently omitted. It's very important for your boss to tell the group about the expectations of his/her boss. Don't rely on your boss to do their job perfectly (more on this later), so try to augment your boss' skills with your own reminders.

, This is a no brainer. Your boss may forget, but don't you be caught forgetting. Be sure you understand when the task is due, what's expected, etc.

, Equally important as the previous step. Don't let requests drag on. Set your own deadline of when you'd like a response from your boss. On that date, the issue gets promoted from chronic to acute. Example: on Jan 2nd you give your boss your training plan for the year, asking for their approval. By Jan. 16th the lack of response from your boss begins to annoy you - it's become a chronic problem. Yes, it doesn't get any worse each day (you can bear it), but it's still a problem. So you set Feb 1st as the critical date. On that date, treat the lack of a response as acute - it's suddenly a serious problem and talk to your boss. This keeps the problem from festering until May 15th.

The real elements of an annoying boss include feelings on your side that the workplace has become unbearable, disrupted, not enjoyable, and perhaps even frightening, because of the actions of your boss, coupled with the reality that your boss has certain undesirable traits or responses when interacting with staff. Signs of a manager who is annoying might include:A manager who is not supportive of staff and works to undermine staff, or who even steals the glory for work completed well by others.
A manager who is deceitful and either lies about performance of workers, or fails to praise or point out when work is done well.
A manager who threatens excessive or inappropriate outcomes for work not completed on time, or in a certain manner.
A manager who doesn't take responsibility for errors but uses workers as scapegoats and blames staff when things go wrong.A manager who practices favoritism in the work place, setting some workers above others for no apparent reason.
A manager who publicly humiliates, condescends, demeans, verbally attacks, or name calls staff.
A manager who hasn't got the slightest interest in your personal life, and goes so far as to not support you when you have family crises or other personal issues that need attending to during work time.
A manager who acts superior all the time, believing their own abilities far above anyone else's, and expects everyone to snap to attention, or else.;
, As well as determining how the manager behaves towards staff, and knowing how this leaves you feeling, it can be helpful to identify certain unacceptable actions that annoying bosses commit regularly. They can include such actions as:Insulting staff members in a very personal manner, often publicly.
Invading your personal space without asking
Threatening you verbally or non-verbally
Sending email flames


Interrupting you rudely during meetings
Giving you dirty looks
Acting as if you are invisible when it suits them
Withholding praise even though you clearly deserve some
Second-guessing all the time or demands perfection
Making sarcastic jokes or teasing you as a means to deliver a nasty message
Reminding you in front of everyone where you stand in the hierarchy
Touching you when it's clear that you don't want this
Making two-faced attacks â you understand one thing from your boss, only to learn later that your boss said something opposite to somebody else
Stealing clients or accounts from other workers
Bad mouthing the firm's culture
Refusing to help or explain anything when asked (but will deny this if pressed by anyone else, and insist it was you who didn't ask for help), etc.!

, Understand that even though it may feel otherwise, this behavior is, overall, not a personal attack against you as a worker or as a person. Most often these managers are trying to prove a point to higher level management by being ""seen"" to be doing the right thing, by directing their energies upwards and not caring for staff., It is vital that you do not take this personally but see it for what it is â your boss's inferiority complex trying to masquerade as fake confidence by using staff as a tool to cover up his or her own inadequacies. When you try to see it this way, you are doing what is known as ""reframing"", to reduce the damage the situation does to you.


Robert Sutton explains the trick is not to expect your annoying boss to change (that's unlikely to occur) but to expect the worst from your boss while expecting that you will remain fine once the ordeal is over.,, Familiarize yourself with work protocols and understand the principles behind what you do. In other words, be prepared to offer a plausible explanation if questioned by your manager. This will also provide a suitable excuse to keep him or her away from rattling you further.


Be one hundred percent across your job description and be able to respond as to how whatever you are doing fits within those parameters. It may sound silly but there are plenty of employees who don't understand fully what their role is, and can become a target of a bullying manager as a result. If you do extend yourself beyond your job description, be prepared with sound reasons for why you did this, how it has not interfered with your usual duties, and how it benefits your boss.

Earn respect by showing confidence in your work. Be organized and manage your time efficiently.
Do not create any opportunities for your annoying manager to call you out for breaking company policy or rules. Adhere strictly to break and lunch times, avoid leaving before your hours are up, and be on duty a few minutes earlier rather than being a few minutes late. Meet your deadlines, or keep people properly informed where deadlines are blowing out. Do not give an annoying boss any reason to find fault with your work or with you as a worker.

, In a subtle way, outdo an annoying boss with your obvious knowledge. Aim to highlight your expertise and deter an annoying boss from prodding you any further. If your expertise is clear and highly respected, an annoying manager will usually back off, knowing that pursuing a petty issue with you can make them appear stupid if they cannot keep up with your points. Do not be arrogant, but display professional etiquette and confidence when making your points.


Seek small wins instead of looking for the knock-out punch. While the larger problem of your annoying boss isn't going to go away, a series of small wins can boost your confidence, build up a more solid workplace positioning for you, and encourage others to do the same as you, which could ultimately undermine your boss's approach and wrest back more control for you and your colleagues., Becoming too familiar with managers who display poor leadership qualities is a perfect recipe for disaster that can even taint you down the track.


Keep a relatively safe working distance by avoiding personal conversations, keeping away, or revealing any information that could be used against you in the future.
Avoid meetings with your annoying boss where possible, or keep them short (look for a room without chairs).A fair amount of mystery is great for keeping you under the radar, and makes for interesting contemplation on the part of your manager.
Don't give in to becoming one of the boss' ""favorites"". Not only can this so-called favored position change at a mere whim, but not being in this position also means that when top management gets wind of how poorly this manager is doing, you won't be tarred with having been compliant with this manager's behavior or favoritism.

, Stick to the facts, stick to what you do know, and don't lash out and criticize the boss.


Learn to think on your feet. Many annoying managers have poor interpersonal skills, which is why we find them annoying. These types are bound to throw questions at you, at the most inappropriate of moments, catching you off-guard or when they know you will falter and stutter. This reflects a power play, a person who is insecure. Always remember this at the back of your mind, as this will help you to cope effectively, knowing the true reason behind the aggressive behavior.
Excuse yourself politely when any confrontation becomes unbearable. If you are losing control during a confronting interaction or you experience difficulties explaining yourself and being understood, make an excuse, and walk away. Go to the bathroom, have a cigarette, throw M&Ms around in the car park, etc., but do not stay in the situation and get yourself dragged in further.

, Being nervous or intimidated will only make you an easier target at work and most often you will end becoming their mental punching bag. Staying calm is a form of control of the situation in itself, and an effective one provided you can maintain it.


Don't perceive yourself as a victim. Don't respond in kind; instead, see yourself as remaining calm, detach yourself emotionally from the annoying manager, and don't try to control what is out of your control. Focus instead on what you can control and on helping others who matter to cope too.Realize that staying calm can infuriate a person unable to control their own angry emotions. Don't let their lack of self-control unnerve you â just observe it for what it is.
Find allies. Find those you can trust and share strategies for coping.
Try daily affirmations or meditation to help you to remain calm.

Take deep breaths and count to 10 before replying to a jibe or other annoying attack from your manager. Think of the chefs on Hell's Kitchen who respond ""Yes Chef!"" and nothing more! (You find out later what they are feeling and thinking!)

, Sometimes an annoying manager will try to extort negative reports on you from others. While disappointing, if people know you are gossiping about them, they will give a negative report about you when a boss goes behind your back. This results in filtered information, which becomes more distorted as it transfers from person to person and this creates the wrong impression, potentially damaging your professional reputation in the process. Avoid falling victim to this destructive behavior by not undermining your colleagues.

, Have rooms where you (and your colleagues) can go and have time out after being around your annoying manager. Let off steam and support one another.


Just be careful that this is a safety zone, and there isn't a possibility of your annoying manager walking in. If so, look further afield, such as a cafe, a neighboring park, etc. For example, nurses can hide away in nurse's lounge away from doctors, or techies in a common room where bosses never are known to go.
Balance the advice on not gossiping with constructive discussions about your boss' poor behavior. It is possible to talk about the facts rather than belittling a person with rumors. Get the mixture accurate and you'll be supported by your coworkers.

, Another suitable alternative would be to look for other positions in the same workplace, if there are any available, such as a lateral move into another department. When you do move, however, be circumspect about your boss and your feelings for this person; people are not impressed by a potential new employee mouthing off against a former boss.

Leverage can consist of such things as getting another job offer performing above and beyond your job description consistently, effectively, and regularly. If you are a ""star employee,"" a good company will often be able to find a bit extra to keep you satisfied. Be aware that it is a fairly standard tactic to tell you that the business is already over its annual budget, to try to deter you from asking.This means that you need to know your worth as assessed against objective criteria (see below) and be persistent.
If you've already negotiated a pay deal with your boss, it may be harder to ask for more. Your boss assumes you're happy with the amount you're getting and isn't not likely to be favorably disposed to adding more financial burden to the company without good reason.
Be careful about using another job offer as leverage. Your boss may call you on it; it's important to really have such a job offer and be willing to take it if you're rebuffed by your boss. Be ready to walk that plank!;
, If your company is already ""over budget"" and suffering as a result of the recession, cut-backs, or any other reasons, you might be better off waiting until later. During a recessionary period, some companies will not be able to provide pay raises without also endangering your job. However, this doesn't mean that you should use this as an excuse to delay asking for a raise indefinitely.

, Read the employee handbook (and company intranet, if you have one), or better yet, talk to someone in Human Resources. Here are some things you should figure out:


Does your company require annual performance reviews to determine your salary?
Do salaries advance according to a fixed schedule or rank?
Who can make the decision (or ask for it to be made)?

, It's easy to believe you're worth more, especially if you feel as if you're giving 110 percent every day, but you need to demonstrate this objectively by assessing your worth against that of others in the same industry. Many employers say they don't give a raise until the employee does 20% more work than he did when he was initially hired. Here are some things you can take into account when you consider your worth:


Your job description
Your responsibilities, including any management or leadership tasks
Years of experience and seniority in the company's line of work
Your level of education
Your location

, While this may be something you took into account when you first negotiated your salary, your role and responsibilities probably have changed. Look at similar levels in the industry to see what others are being paid for similar work. Determine the usual salary range for those who do what you do in your region or area. Getting market data for comparable positions can empower you by helping you be and feel more knowledgeable when you talk with your boss. You can check out comparable positions at Salary.com, GenderGapApp, or Getraised.com.While these things will be helpful when you build your case, they should not be used as the principal argument for getting a pay raise; they simply inform you about your potential worth, not your boss., Subscribe to and read at least one trade journal regularly and make it a point to discuss the future with your colleagues.


You should also keep your eyes on the horizon and regularly envision the path ahead for your company and for the industry. Make it a point to consciously set aside time at the end of each month to critically examine the path ahead.
The very act of anticipating needed actions will serve you well in day-to-day operations and in salary re-negotiaon: You will be leading the way into the future and enhancing the company's ability to capitalize on the changing market.

, It is best to use accurate performance measures such as quality improvement, customer satisfaction, and, especially, growth in profits. The list will remind you of your own worth, make it concrete, and provide an objective basis for your demands.


While some people believe it's helpful to write down accomplishments to present to your boss, others believe your accomplishments should already be evident and you should only need to highlight those to remind your boss of what he already knows and reinforce that knowledge.It depends on what you know about your boss's preferences, your relationship dynamics with your boss, and your own level of comfort with reciting your accomplishments verbatim.
If you choose to convince your boss verbally, memorize the list.
If you choose to present a written copy to your boss for his or her reference, have somebody proofread it for you first.

, Pay particular attention to projects you've worked on, problems you have helped solve, and how business operations and profits have improved since you started. This is about more than just doing your job well, which you're already expected to do, but about going above and beyond the duties of your job and, ultimately, it boils down to improving the company's bottom line. Some questions to consider when developing your case include:


Did you complete or help to complete a tough project? And get positive results from it?
Did you work extra hours or meet an urgent deadline? Are you continuing to demonstrate this type of commitment?
Did you take initiative? In what ways?
Did you go beyond the call of duty? In what ways?
Did you save the company time or money?
Did you improve any systems or processes?
Did you empower others with your support and guidance or training? As Carolyn Kepcher says, ""A rising tide lifts all boats,""and a boss wants to hear that you've helped facilitate team members and make them stronger, more positive forces for the company.

, This indicates to your boss that you see the larger picture and are positioned to help the company identify and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. You will always be one step ahead of the others in thinking about where the company is headed.Be sure to identify specific long-term goals and objectives that will benefit the company in the future.
Keeping an existing employee happy is also less of a hassle than conducting interviews and hiring a new one. While you donât want to say this outright, emphasizing a positive role in your company's evolution which helps assure the company's future success will definitely resonate with your boss.

, It's important not to appear greedy, but rather to remain realistic and reasonable.


If you feel comfortable with your position, tie the salary increase to the increased revenue or profit that is tied to your past successes and expectations for the near future. If you anticipate being able to bring home a lucrative project or contract in the next few months, that may well fund your pay raise (and more). The implication that the next ten months of your year are all bottom-line profit does not have to be stated explicitly, but, if the case is made convincingly, the conclusion is inescapable. If your boss sees an easy way to justify the salary increase to superiors, you are in a strong position, indeed.
The usual tactic of negotiating from a much higher point isn't as good an idea with salary increase requests because your boss might think you're trying to milk the company and push the boundaries.
You can break the numbers down so they seem less imposing. For example, you can explain it as being an extra $40 a check rather than $2,200 for the year.You can also negotiate for more than just a pay raise. Maybe you're happy to take other things in lieu of money, such as shares in the company, a wardrobe allowance, rental assistance, or even a more prestigious title. Ask for a company car, or for a better one. If appropriate, talk about increased benefits, more conspicuous job titles, and modifications to your responsibilities, management oversight, or assignments.
Be prepared to compromise and haggle. Even though you haven't given your boss an unrealistic figure, you should expect some bargaining to go on if your boss is receptive to the request.

, Though it can be hard to get a pay raise, it's worse to fall into the mindset of not asking for a pay rise, ever.


In particular, women are often afraid to ask for a pay raise due to a mindset that does not want to appear demanding or pushy.See this as an opportunity to show that you care enough to develop a career trajectory that favors your workplace as well as yourself.

Negotiation is a learned skill. If you are afraid of this aspect, take some time out to learn it and practice implementing it in a variety of contexts before approaching your boss.

, Successful requests are all about good timing. Ask yourself what you have done within a demonstrable time period that has made you more valuable to the firm or organization. It doesn't make sense to ask for a pay raise when you've not yet demonstrated anything amazing for the firm -- regardless of long you've been there.


The time is right when your value to the organization is clearly high.This means seizing the iron while it's hot and asking for a pay raise off the back of excellent successes such as holding a highly successful conference, getting fantastic feedback, getting a big client signed on, producing outstanding work that outsiders have praised, etc.
Don't choose a time when the company has just posted major losses.Asking for a pay rise based purely on ""time done"" is dangerous because it makes you appear like a timekeeper rather than someone interested in the company's progression. Never say to your boss: ""I've been here for a year and I deserve a pay rise.âYour boss will be likely to respond, ""And so what?""

, Set time aside. If you just walk up and ask for a raise, you'll seem unprepared -- and come across like you don't deserve one. You don't have to give too much advance notice, but do seek privacy and a time you know you won't be interrupted. For example, when you walk in to work in the morning, say: ""Before you leave, I'd like to speak with you.""


Remember, a face-to-face request is far harder to turn down than a letter or email.
Try to avoid Monday, when there will be a million things to do, or Friday, when your boss may already have other things on his mind.

, Be confident, not arrogant, and stay positive. Speak politely and clearly to better maintain your composure. And finally, keep in mind that it probably won't be half as bad to ask as it did to work up the nerve! When you talk to your boss, lean in a bit if you're sitting down. This will help project confidence.


Start by saying how much you enjoy your job. Being personable will help make that human connection with your boss.
Follow up by discussing your achievements. This will show your boss why a pay raise matters to you.

, Don't just say, ""I want a raise."" Tell your boss how much more money you want to make in percentage terms, such as wanting to make 10% more money. You can also talk in terms of how much you would like your yearly salary to increase. Whatever you say, be as specific as possible, so your boss sees that you've really thought it through. Here are the things that can happen:


If it's an outright ""no,"" see the next section.
If it's ""I need time to think about this,"" try to pinpoint a future time for reopening the discussion.
If your boss agrees immediately, say something like, ""Don't say yes unless you mean it"" as a means of reinforcing it in his or her mind and then proceed to ""hold your boss"" to it (see below)., This is important regardless of the answer youâve been given.You can even go ""over and above"" by giving your boss more than they're expecting from you, such as a thank-you card or lunch invitation to say thanks. Consider sending a follow up email as well even if you've said thank you person multiple times., If the answer was yes, the final hurdle may be actually receiving the raise. Back-pedaling â or even simple forgetfulness -- are always possibilities. Donât jump to conclusions if the raise does not go into effect right away. Things do go wrong: your boss might encounter resistance from the higher-ups or face budgetary problems, etc.


Making your boss feel bad about reneging (for example, mentioning someone you know who asked for a pay raise only to have a boss take it back and how staff morale plummeted). This will have to be done subtly and with tact.
Ask when your boss will implement the pay raise. A subtle way of doing this might be to ask if there is anything you need to sign to put it into effect.
Go one step further and tell your boss: ""I guess that you'll have this arranged by the end of the month after you've approved the paperwork,â etc.; this puts a plan into action so that he or she doesn't have to.

, If you allow the rejection to sour your attitude or affect your work, your boss will probably feel like (s)he made the right decision. If you develop a reputation for having a bad attitude or for not accepting feedback, then your boss will be even less likely to give you a raise. Once your boss gives his final verdict, be as gracious as possible. Don't walk out of the room and slam the door.

, This demonstrates your willingness to take your boss's opinions into account. It may be that both of you can agree on increased responsibilities and activities over a certain time period that gradually leads to a new role and a pay increase. This will also demonstrate your commitment to your job and your ability to work hard. Your boss will see you as a go-getter and you'll be on his radar the next time raise season rolls around.


If you are a star employee, keep performing excellently and ask again in a few months time.

, It will also remind your boss that you're grateful for the conversation that you had and shows him that you have follow-through.

, Your desire for a pay raise is now out in the open and your boss should be concerned about the possibility that you are looking for work elsewhere. Set a date for when you will ask again. Until that time, be sure to kick your work into high gear. Don't slack off just because you're disappointed that you won't be getting a raise yet.

, You should never have to settle for less than you deserve. If you're shooting higher than your company is willing to pay, maybe it's better to apply for a different position that has a higher salary -- either with your company or another one. Think this possibility through carefully; there's no need to burn bridges just because your conversation with your boss didn't go well.


It's better to stick with it for a little while longer to try to work for that raise. But if months have passed and you haven't gotten the recognition you deserve in spite of your hard work, then don't feel bad about seeing what other companies have to offer.

Be clear about the organization structure, goals and your responsibilities.,
Understand the trade offs and balance among resources.,
Collaborate with other team members to complete project plans.,
Measure your performance.,
Make sure the team learns from its experiences.",How to Help Your Boss Succeed2," You may have thought of a better way to split up responsibilities, but don't just nod your head in agreement and then keep on doing it the old way. If the organizational structure follows some standard , then get to know the standard.

, There's never going to be enough staff, time, money, space, technology, etc. for the workload. Understand how your boss has decided to mix and match these resources.

, Here's an example of where the team offloads work from the boss. Don't expect the boss to be equally effective in all phases of a project, all processes, all skills. Consider any project plan to be a framework and fill in the empty areas.

, If there are already metrics in place, use them and study the results. Yes, you can learn from disasters, but you'll need metrics to gradually improve your processes when you've eliminated disasters. If the team doesn't already have metrics, then invent your own and measure yourself. Create a metric, gather and analyze the data and study the results. Once the metric has served its purpose, turn to another area to improve - drop the first metric and start another.

, After the completion of every project have a debriefing of what went right and what could be improved. This would normally be the responsibility of a manager to set this up, but the team is perfectly capable of doing this on their own.

Hand off work between team members effectively and efficiently.,
Cross train members of your team.,
Encourage productive feedback among team members.,
Be careful your team doesn't turn into a fiefdom.Fiefdoms are teams gone bad - where people on a team ""protect"" their data, use non standard processes, and discourage interactions with other teams.",How to Help Your Boss Succeed3," Your shift may be ending or someone else could do the job better. For whatever reason for a hand off, getting the job done is more important than individual egos. Your team's client doesn't care who does it, just that it gets done.

, You know all those emails you've received in the past six months that tinker with how the team works, explain how to use certain tools and outline priorities? The person who just joined your team didn't receive them because they weren't here. Make sure they learn about recent team issues and resolutions.

, If you know a better way of doing things then share it with others. If someone else knows a better way, learn it. And don't restrict feedback to criticism. Give out some praise for a job well done. We'd all like the feedback to come from the boss, but by sharing feedback yourselves, you offload some work from your boss.

, Fiefdoms lead to turf wars - conflicts over which team has what responsibility. They drain productivity from the company. Classic symptoms of fiefdoms are ""providing a feed"" to another group (instead of access to live corporate data) and being told ""not to talk to someone"" outside the team.

If you could benefit from coaching, ask for it.,
Create a one page profile of your boss.",How to Help Your Boss Succeed4," Get your time card in on time, create whatever weekly or monthly reports are required, etc. Anytime you delay these tasks, you drain away time and energy from your boss. You really don't want to do that.

, During the year, your boss will say ""... will be considered in performance review."" Don't be too surprised if they forget all the things they said over the year, but also don't be surprised if they do remember.

, Work out your own training plan. Take stock of your accomplishments every two months, so you'll be ready at the end of the year.

, Despite all of the management advice in the press, tasks like coaching are likely to be jettisoned because of time constraints on your boss. With a direct request for coaching on a specific topic, you can get the coaching you need.

, A profile is a list of someone's goals, constraints, expectations, preferences, likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses. The profile reminds you of how to avoid interrupting your boss and how best to help them to resolve an issue. Look through this article for all mentions of ""preference"" and that's a good start for a profile. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) may suggest other ways of understanding and helping your boss.

See the storm coming.,
Give them space.,
Defuse situations with gratitude and kindness.,
Make sure itâs not you.",How to Deal With a Moody Boss1," Start noticing patterns in your bossâs moody behavior. For instance, your boss might typically be in a foul mood in the mornings before having some coffee or after having a meeting with their own supervisor. If you know that your boss will be in a mood during those times, keep your head down, do your work, and avoid asking them questions until later.Select meeting times when your bossâs mood seems to be better or during low stress periods at work.
You might also consider making a note of every time your boss is in a bad mood. Write down the time and the circumstances surrounding their mood.;
, When your boss is in a foul mood, avoid knocking on their door or calling them to ask them questions. Instead, work to problem solve on your own and avoid making any major decisions until you can clear it when your boss is in a better mood.

, When you feel that your boss is on edge and on the verge of an outburst, do what you can to deescalate the situation. If they have recently helped you with something or given good advice, send them an email saying âThank you for all of your help with my project yesterday.â This will help to stroke their ego a bit, soothe them, and avoid them seeing you from a lens of anger.You might also do a random act of kindness for them like bringing them some coffee.

, Though you might feel that your boss is moody, you should first determine what you are doing, if anything, to contribute to that. If you do not complete your tasks on time, regularly come in late, or often make mistakes, then you could be the problem. Work to improve yourself so that you do not trigger frustration in your boss or peers.Listen carefully when your boss gives you a task or a piece of constructive criticism and work to follow through. Donât use your cell phone during this time.
However, regardless of what you have done, your boss should not yell, curse, or insult you.

Treat your young boss like you would any other boss: with complete respect from the word go.,
Focus on the positives of having a young boss.,
Take stock of your own skills.,
Update your skills.,
Speak up about your skills.,
Dress well.,
Be a mentor.,
Be known by all the bosses.,
Raise issues assertively.,
Invite your boss to social events occasionally.",How to Cope with Having a Younger Boss," Your boss got the position because he or she has the right skills and impressed the superiors. It won't get you anywhere to spread rumors, gossip or innuendos about the boss and his or her age. It is far better to respect the evident skills the boss brings to the job and to concentrate on the ways that you can genuinely help him or her. Be open to the new possibilities of working with someone who is likely very talented.;
, You will continue to feel uncomfortable if you look at all the negatives of the situation. Instead, see the pluses - the energy, dynamism, fresh ideas and new perspectives that a young boss can bring to a workplace are all great assets. And it is highly likely that you have an intelligent boss, which is definitely an asset.

, Although your boss is younger, you have plenty to offer - experience, maturity and the knowledge of how things will often pan out. In addition, it is likely that you are well-rounded at taking on numerous tasks at once and that you already have a well-developed and extensive network of personal contacts and professional contacts from prior work. Focusing on your own strengths may ease any feelings of insecurity or resentment towards your boss.

, Especially if you have been out of the workforce for a time, there is likely to be a need in some areas of your career skills that need polishing or extending. It's particularly important to keep up with any market trends and technological developments that could improve your effectiveness. Request to attend courses that will improve your skills and knowledge base. This will not only bring you up-to-speed quickly but may also result in you being the key person the boss comes to for implementing the new skills.

, Do not be shy to let the boss know that you have good skills in certain areas. Without bragging or boasting, let him or her know what projects, activities and sales you have already accomplished in your life. Do this when it's appropriate--such as when making a case that a certain project should be assigned to you--rather than to convince someone that you're right.

, Just because you are older doesn't mean that you should present a frumpy, older image to the world. Instead, continue to update your style and fashion sense so that it continues to reflect a professional, up-to-date image. Don't try to copy the boss and dress in styles that are possibly unsuited to your age but do keep your existing wardrobe abreast of current trends and styles.

, The natural tendency to help the young with the wisdom of the elders is not a bad thing to instigate with care and gentleness. Be someone that the boss can rely on for advice and sounding of ideas. Take care not to come across as condescending or intrusive, but do impart your knowledge with humility, goodwill and in the way of mentoring.

, When you get the opportunity to work with other bosses in the workplace, ensure that they are aware of your skills and worth so that this will reinforce your importance and value amongst the entire workplace.

, As with any boss, do not feel that you cannot discuss issues directly with your boss. If you experience discomfort because of your age gap, ask for a private moment and raise it tactfully and respectfully. You may be surprised to find that your boss has similar feelings about the age issues, or may have some very interesting perspectives that settle the issue satisfactorily for you. You won't know until you ask.

, Take the boss to drinks or dinner with the office crew Friday night and get to know one another better. It'll probably make life a lot easier for all of you.

Have a conversation.,
Document everything.,
Interact politely but assertively.",How to Deal With a Moody Boss2," If you are considering reporting your boss for their behavior, pause before going to upper level management. First, have a talk with your boss to see if things improve. There could be things going on in their life that you donât know about or perhaps they are frustrated with your work as of late.During a time of calmness, approach them and see if they have a few minutes to talk. If they are typically very busy, then set up a meeting beforehand.
Say something like âI really enjoy working here but sometimes, especially in the mornings, you yell at me and other team members. That makes it hard for me to want to work hard for you because I am frustrated. Is there anything going on with you right now or anything that I can do better or differently?

, Moodiness might cause your boss to accuse you of poor performance, even when you are doing your best at your job. By keeping detailed records of what the boss has asked of you, including asking for clarifications, extensions, and changes to your work, you can provide proof when your moody boss accuses you of not following directions. It's not your place to prevent their moodiness, but it is your place to prove that you had a set of expectations in place and that you have fulfilled these as requested.After meetings with your boss, consider sending them an email about what you were asked to do, to clarify.
You can say something like âAs a clarification, in our meeting you said that you want me to create a one page document highlighting all of our services and to share it with the team before publishing it. I wanted to confirm that this is correct before moving forward.â

, Know that you have a right to express your boundaries in the workplace. This means making it clear in a polite but forthright manner when things are not appropriate in your interactions together. For example, if your moody boss is working up to a screeching match about some work you've done, instead of screeching back, simply say firmly that you will return to discuss the work when the two of you have had a chance to calm down and think about it a little more.


Or, if you feel constrained to sit there, be calm and confident and when the tirade ends, simply say ""Thank you for your observations. I will consider them all in detail and provide you with a written response.""
Use evidence and logic when your moody boss veers off into blanket allegations or rants.
Avoid accusations, allegations, and ultimatums yourself. These upset any person, moody or not, and even if your boss is using these tactics, don't copy.

"
"
Stay calm.,
Limit your interactions with them.,
Stay healthy and well rested.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Know when to get help and when to leave.",How to Deal With a Moody Boss3," When your boss is in a bad mood, work to stay as calm and tranquil as possible. If you cannot leave the situation, take a few deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. If you can make an escape, take a walk around the block, go get a snack, or even take your lunch break. Doing so will prevent you from lashing out., Though you cannot avoid them entirely, you can certainly limit your interactions. Instead of popping in their office to ask a question, send an email instead. If you tend to end up in the elevator with them in the mornings, take the stairs instead or arrive a few minutes earlier., It is much harder to deal with other people when you're sleep deprived or hungry. Daily exercise, regular and healthy sleep patterns, and nutritionally sound eating are crucial in dealing with difficult people because you'll feel strong in body and mind, and you won't easily succumb to the stress.

, Humor can greatly boost your own mood as well as general office morale. Take some time during your difficult work day to laugh. You can watch funny videos online, find some hilarious memes on social media, or call up a friend of yours who is sure to make you laugh.


With your coworkers, avoid making jokes about your boss, however.

, If your bossâs mood is affecting your health and you have already spoken to them, then it is time to make a report or find a new job. If others in your department have reported them as well, it may be worth it to wait it out before finding alternative employment in case your boss is fired.If your boss ever hits you, is sexually inappropriate, or verbally abusive, report them immediately. Do not wait it out.
An example of verbal abuse would be if your boss calls you stupid or uses racial slurs.

Figure out whether or not the boss has a point.,
React professionally.,
Think through the ways in which you can react to the professed desire to micro-manage you.,
Be prepared to show what systems you have in place to counter micro-management.,
Use a little bit of flattery.,
Seek training or up-skilling.,
Lie low.,
Perform well.",How to Deal With a Boss Who Accuses You of Needing Micro Managing," If you feel that this has been leveled at you unfairly, make sure it is not just your personal sense of shame driving your indignant reaction. On the other hand, if your boss is renowned for poking his or her nose where it's not wanted, it's probable that you're right to feel a sense of irritation with being told that you're not managing well alone. Try to see things from your manager's point of view in order to deal with this objectively:


Senior management is always under pressure and sometimes middle management is a convenient, albeit unfortunate, target. If your boss has a habit of meddling, there really is no reason to take this personally; it is a bad habit that your boss has formed and cannot shake. Another reason for accusing someone of needing micro-management is a poorly thought out reaction to a stressful situation that has just passed, for example, your team missed a deadline or mucked up some of a task and the senior boss feels a sense of responsibility and possible guilt for not having kept himself or herself better informed. And then there is just the boss who is incapable of delegating and thinks nothing of reprimanding middle management for anything that they think they could do better (but clearly don't have the time to do). In each of these cases, it's about your boss' internalized reactions and it is not necessarily about you.
Perhaps there are a series of things you haven't been doing to a satisfactory standard and your boss is reaching the end of his or her tether trying to get results from you. In this situation, your boss might be offering an olive branch warning to you, as in, ""get it right with my direction, or else..."". See How to Accept Blame when You Deserve It.;
, Even if it is about you, try hard not to take it personally but prefer to see this as a management mechanism rather than as a personal attack. This is absolutely crucial to maintaining an objective viewpoint of the situation and reacting with constructive responses. See How to Accept Criticism With Grace and Appreciation.

, Here are some things to consider:


Ask for a meeting to talk through the issues of concern. Ask that it be set at a time when you have enough time to spend talking about issues uninterrupted and where it will be private.
Ask your boss for clarity on what he or she means. They cannot just level an accusation like this at you without providing adequate reason, factual examples, and suggested solutions. Ask for all of this to be explained through with you.

Think honestly about what you can do to change your manager's perception. Think less about offloading blame and more about the way forward.
Request that your boss give you some time to think over what he or she has said and that you would like to get back promptly with suggestions for a way forward.

, Take a little time to write out a plan that will address the issues raised by your boss. Signal areas of weakness (check out How to Communicate Your Weaknesses) and provide evidence of how you will address them. For example, if your team keeps missing deadlines, write out a proposal for how you will prevent this in future. You might propose using a team whiteboard system with a series of mini-deadlines to be met, a series of check-ins with you, and a weekly check-in with your boss. You could schedule client review of progress as an early dress rehearsal to instill the urgency in your team members earlier on. Think of the ways that will improve efforts. Take this plan back to your boss and discuss it with them.

, Say that you're perfectly happy for your boss to review your performance but do not feel there is a need for them to be involved every step of the way. Flatter them by acknowledging that you understand that your boss' time is precious and that he or she has plenty of more important things to be attending to than moderating what you should be getting right as a manager. Offer a weekly review discussion in place of micro-management; in this way, you retain the control and place yourself in the position of discussing progress instead of having it metered out for you.

, If you do feel like a fish out of water in your role and you think training might improve things for your management abilities, let your boss know. It is helpful to understand workplace policies on training availability first so that you can put a solid pitch to your boss. You might even benefit from helping your boss succeed.

, If you really feel that your boss is fiddling too much and making your life a misery, sometimes it is best to just go with it for a while until your boss wears themselves out or finds another pet project to bother. Micro-management is a very exhausting and wasteful behavior and few can keep it up to any extent. If your boss is a perennial micro-manager, however, and this causes you a lot of angst, it might be time to find a new position and a new boss.

, The sweetest revenge is to do your job well. Ensure that you are meeting your job description and doing things to the best of your ability. Human resources can be an ally if you can show them how you are performing all the tasks required of you and other bosses will notice that you are doing what is expected of you as well. Sometimes it is best to just get on with the job and let the micro-manager's fragility evidence itself.

Buy a wireless keyboard.,
Flip it around.,
Practice.,
Show off your skills.",How to Type Upside Down2," You can get a decent one for around $20 and a really nice one for around $50. Do some comparative research online to find one that speaks to you.


Alright, alright, you're right. A wireless keyboard isn't completely necessary. But when it's wireless, it's a lot easier to...

, Those ""make your brain faster"" websites ain't got nothing on you. QWERTY? No thanks. That's for plebeians. ââ´É¹ÆMQ is what your fingers run on now (or, in all actuality, uÉ¯'Ë/). Now the numbers are subject to your thumbs and the spacebar is manned by your index fingers. Looking at the keyboard the way an average human does is just quaint, really.


The text will remain normal on the screen. For this method, reading isn't the work you'll be doing -- you'll literally have to reprogram your hands. You were typing 90 WPM...but now you type 5 WPM. Challenge extended!

, This is going to be very, very difficult, especially if you've been typing for years and can do it without looking at the keys. Now not only will your mind not know where to put your fingers but your thoughts on what to write will probably just stop. You'll sit there, upside-down keyboard in your hands and the only thing that will run across your overwhelmed brain is, ""How is this going to benefit me ever?!"" Relax. Keep going. You'll get better.


In a few weeks' time, you'll be able to tackle a computer from any angle. Once you get good, try attacking a desktop standing and from the back. For a true challenge, use one of those old box-y ones; the flat screens make it too easy.

, Don't tell anyone about this new resume-builder you've been working on. Then, spring it on them. Bet your friend you can type the opening monologue to Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet upside-down before they can even recite it. Can you do it with your eyes closed, too?


Tell them you've mastered the art of disengaging your brain from the constraints of reality and you can take any image in your head and flip it around. When you start typing, you see the keyboard as normal. Boom. What material shall your pedestal be made from?

Know the characteristics.,
Start with the tone marks.,
Learn the diacritical marks.",How to Type Vietnamese1," VNI uses the digits row to add tones and diacritical marks. While it is the easier oneÂ to learn, it may take slightly longer to type since a 4th row is involved.
, Tone marks can be typed any time after a vowel is typed, and the software will automatically place the marks at their correct places. For example, to type ""mÃ¡"" (mother), you need to type ""ma1""; to type ""mÃ£"" (code), type ""ma4"". The tone does not need to directly follow the vowel, so to type ""máº¡ng"" (web), you can either type ""ma5ng"", ""man5g"", or ""mang5"" (note that m5ang is not accepted).

Sharp tone ('dáº¥u sáº¯c') is 1
Hanging tone ('dáº¥u huyá»n') is 2
Asking tone ('dáº¥u há»i') is 3
Tumbling tone ('dáº¥u ngÃ£') is 4
Heavy tone ('dáº¥u náº·ng') is 5

, Similar to tone marks, they can be typed at any point after the letter that it is supposed to be placed on. You only need to type once if there are 2 horns in a word; for example, to type ""xÆ°Æ¡ng"" (bone), type ""xuong7""

Circumflex (found in Ã¢, Ãª, Ã´) is 6
Horn (found in Æ¡, Æ°) is 7
Breve (found in Ä) is 8
Crossbar (found in Ä) is 9
The 0 key is used to erase the tone mark or diacritical mark in that word.

It is harder than VNI, but once mastered, it allows faster typing since only 3 rows are used. Telex is particularly common on mobile phones, since the number row is usually not displayed., Similar to VNI, tone marks can be typed at any point after the vowel.

Sharp tone ('dáº¥u sáº¯c') is s
Hanging tone ('dáº¥u huyá»n') is f

Choose between a mechanical or electric typewriter.There are a few broad categories of typewriter available on the market.,
Load a typewriter ribbon.,
Feed paper into the typewriter.,
Set your margins.Margins will dictate how much of the page will be printed on.,
Type text with the typewriter keys.The vast majority of your experience with a typewriter will involve typing your desired text onto the page.,
Keep your typing force consistent.With manual typewriters, the action is completely hand-powered.,
Press the carriage return lever when the bell sounds.When you type to the end of a row, there should be a bell indicating the typewriter needs to be reset.,
Erase mistakes.Chances are high you will make mistakes while using a typewriter.,
Create a rough draft first.,
Keep your typewriter covered when not in use.Although many typewriter users enjoy the look of a typewriter, it's nonetheless a good idea to keep it covered up with a cloth.,
Dust your typewriter regularly.Dust tends to slip under the typewriter keys.,
Release the paper when you're finished using it.Forgetting to reset the paper release after use is a common mistake by typewriter users.,
Check your typewriter's manual.,
Store your typewriter somewhere dry and temperate.Typewriters are usually fine to keep around in an office space for the long-term.,
Get your typewriter refurbished.After a certain point, it may be helpful to get your typewriter refurbished.",How to Type on a Typewriter," The most widely-used of these are mechanical typewriters, which are completely hand-powered. Electric typewriters, on the other hand, need to be plugged in to function. However, they automate some of the trickier aspects of typewriter use, such as erasing and consistent printing. Choose a typewriter that fits the experience you would like to have.


Mechanical typewriters can be taken around and used anywhere, regardless of your access to electricity.
Electric typewriters will speed up your progress by removing the time-wasting setbacks of their hand-powered counterparts.
There are also fully electronic typewriters available. These have an LCD display screen and the text is digital, much like a regular computer.If you opt for a fully electronic typewriter, you can save the material onto a floppy disk and print it from there.;
, Typewriter ribbons are where the typewriter will get its ink from.To change or load a ribbon, remove the typewriter's case. Next, thread the ribbon around your typewriter's spools, making sure that the ribbon is relatively smooth. Place the lid back on the typewriter when you are finished.


You'll know that the ribbon is in need of changing when the ink becomes less prominent on the page.
These ribbons are harder to come by now that typewriters have become less common. However, they should be sold anywhere typewriters are sold. Online outlets will also have typewriter ribbons available for purchase.

, A typewriter will have a slot to put paper in. Slide your paper in and straighten it before locking the paper in with the paper release lever.When you have filled up a page with text, pull the paper release lever forward and remove the paper from the typewriter. It is recommended you put all finished paper in a tray. That way, you won't lose pages or their order.

, Manual typewriters have a margin setting located behind the page. From there, you can manually align the margin to your liking.


There is an automatic margin function on some typewriters.

, Typing on a typewriter requires more force than a computer. You should try to keep your touch on the keys short but firm.


One good way of approaching typing is to imagine the keys are hot to the touch. Don't press them down for too long, and keep your movement from key to key fluid., This means that the intensity of the type on the page will depend on the force of your key pressing. Although it may be difficult at first if you're used to typing on a computer, make an effort to keep the force of your key pressings consistent and firm.

, To do this, take the carriage return and slide it back to the other end. This simple process will be done each time you get to the end of another line.


Roll the paper up a notch for the next line of text. Electric typewriters do this automatically.
Replace the page with another blank sheet when you're done with it.

, There are different ways to go about erasing mistakes, depending on the form of typewriter you're using. If you have a mechanical typewriter, you'll have to apply white-out eraser manually to the mistakes. Electric typewriters often come equipped with a second ribbon of white-out eraser to blot out mistakes. The best way to contend with typewriting mistakes is to avoid them altogether. Type with greater care than you would on a computer.


A common trick for rubbing out mistakes is to backpedal over the unwanted text and type a row of x's atop them.
If there are significant issues on a page, it may be prudent to start the page over and copy the good material over again.

, Because there is such difficulty in correcting mistakes on a typewriter, it's common form for users to make a rough draft copy before moving on to the real thing. Write your first draft and keep changes you want to make in mind when you write subsequent drafts. Draft your work one page at a time. This will help ensure proper sequence between pages, reducing the risk of getting your pages mixed up.

, This will reduce the amount of dust getting trapped under the keys. If you're insistent on keeping the typewriter unveiled, you should prepare to dust and clean it a lot more than you normally would.


If you own a typewriter purely for decoration, you won't need to guard it as such.

, Especially if your typewriter is a manual model, this will negatively affect its efficiency. Make a regular habit of dusting your typewriter at least once a month. Make an effort to get between the cracks in the keys and sweep out any dust that may have accumulated.

, Leaving the paper release on causes undue pressure which can result in a lasting imprint. Bring the paper release lever forward whenever you're not using the typewriter.

, If you've purchased a typewriter new, it should come with an instruction manual. Whenever you're in doubt, you should refer to the manual. It will offer guidance specific to that model, and should offer a clear step-by-step process on how to use it.


Checking your model's warranty status is helpful if there are any issues with the product.

, However, if you're storing one, it's important to keep it somewhere where it won't be too hot or cold. Extremes in temperature will warp the parts and affect the rubber in the machine. Excessive moisture can also ruin the machine.


If you're boxing the typewriter, make sure to coat it in bubble wrap., If you can't get your typewriter to work, send it to a repair store. In the majority of cases, a repairman will be able to bring your typewriter back up to working condition. Aesthetic improvements, such as repainting and polishing the model, can make a big difference if you care about the way your typewriter looks.


Don't modify your typewriter if it's an antique model. An antique will quickly lose its value if it's been tampered with in any significant way.

Buy a good keyboard.,
Get used to it.",How to Type Quickly2," Some people like the feel of laptop keyboards while other people like the feel of pushing big, chunky keys. If you're concerned with numbers, you may want to buy a keyboard that has a number pad -- not all laptops do.


There are tons of different keyboards out there nowadays. Some are wavy, some are slanted upright, some are big and some are small. Stick to something that's close to what you've been working with, otherwise it may feel like starting over.

, You know how you can run super fast on a treadmill, but the second you get outside, it's difficult to maintain a slow jog? Or how in painting with one medium you're Michelangelo but with another your paintings are as bad as your baby sister's? It's the same with keyboards. On one you may be Speedy Gonzalez; another, Yertle the Turtle. So get used to yours. The more used to it you are, the faster you'll be able to be.


This is going to take time. So start surfing the net actively. Comment on YouTube, write articles on wikiHow, and start a blog. In no time flat you'll be accustomed to the feel and spacing of your keyboard. You'll also start being able to go on autopilot when it comes to finding letters.

"
"
Remember that there's no place like the home row.,
Use all your fingers.,
Cover your keyboard.,
Memorize keyboard shortcuts.",How to Type Quickly3," If you've been gaming, this may be a difficult habit to pick up. Your 8 fingers (not your thumbs) should be on the home row -- a, s, d, f and j, k, l,Â ;. This maximizes the efficacy of your hands by spreading them out across the length of the keyboard.


See those little ridges on the f and j keys? That's to help you. If for some reason your sense of sight were to be heinously taken from you tomorrow, you'd know where to put your hands. Line up your pointer fingers on those keys and spread out your next six fingers accordingly.
ALWAYS RETURN TO THE HOME ROW. You may find yourself asking, ""Why?"" Just do it. When you always know where your fingers are, there's no need to wonder what they're doing or what letters they're about to push. What does that mean? With enough practice, your eyes will always be on the screen. Eventually you'll know where every key is in relation to your fingers, making your manual dexterity the only obstacle to your speed.

, This makes the most logical sense -- if you only had six fingers to type with, you couldn't even reach certain areas of the keyboard in a sprightly manner. So if you have all ten of your fingers, be thankful and put them to good use. You'll type that much faster for it.


If you have to hunt and peck at first, that's normal. Ease yourself into spreading your hands out over the keyboard. With the 8 on the home row and your thumbs on the space bar, start typing. Let each finger have the letters around it and only use the finger that is closest.

, Once you have a pretty good idea where all the keys are, cover your keyboard. You'll remove the temptation to look down at the keys, which ultimately just slows you down.


If you don't have the side of a box to use, just cover your hands (and subsequently the keyboard) with a scarf or something similar. If you have to use the backspace often, that's fine. That habit will diminish with practice.

, With technology nowadays, typing isn't just words and phrases. To type quickly and get your work done, you also need to know how to manipulate your computer to perform as efficiently as possible. Instead of parading you cursor around the screen, know keyboard shortcuts to get the job done even faster.


Here are some useful shortcuts:Ctrl + Z = Undo
Ctrl + X = Cut
Ctrl + S = Save
Ctrl + A = Highlight everything
Shift + arrow = Highlight next letter
Ctrl + arrow = Navigate text cursor to next word without highlight

Make tasks computer oriented. Your grocery list is now on your computer. Studying for school? Type out your notes. Need to organize data for your taxes or for class? Spreadsheet time!

, There are dozens of websites that are geared to making speedy typing fun while simultaneously improving your WPM rate. There are games, calculators, and generators that all aim to make your typing faster and more accurate. Chatting will get you faster, too.


Typing Maniac and Type Racer are two games that make typing fun.There's also a ton of other sites that are more learning based. Some websites will generate nonsense words (that are much more difficult to type quickly) and some will concentrate on combinations and finger placement.Even others will be offered in multiple languages.
When you feel that you have given yourself time to learn to the positions of letters on the keyboard and have developed stamina, join an online chat program. Try to spend a little bit of time everyday interacting with the other people online.

Don't give up.",How to Type Faster," You should try to set yourself up with somewhere comfortable,well-lit, and well-ventilated for typing. You should definitely be typing at a desk or table and not on your lap. Being comfortable is very important if you want to work for extended periods. Make sure you get these details right before you go any farther.

, The correct posture for typing is seated, with a straight back and feet planted shoulder-width apart, flat on the floor. Your wrists should be at the same level as the keyboard so that your fingers can arch over the keys easily. You should tilt your head down slightly when you look at the screen, and your eyes should be around 45-70cm from the screen.Most office chairs are adjustable. Tinker with your setup until you find the right seat height.

, Itâs important not to let your form slip as you go. Keep your posture and body position good to avoid aching wrists which will make you slow down and upset your rhythm.Donât let your shoulders and back hunch up, try to keep relaxed, but upright.

, Most keyboards use the same layout, called the QWERTY layout because of the letters that make up the left side of the top row of letter keys. Many keyboards also have various other buttons around them that do different things.


Most keys on the keyboard are used to type their corresponding character into a text area. Open up a text file and try pressing all of the keys to see what they do.
Practice memorising the positions of the letter keys and common punctuation marks. You will need to know where these are without looking at the keyboard if you ever hope to become a fast typist.

, To type quickly, you must hold your hands and fingers in a certain position over the keys, and let them return to that position when at rest. Your hands should also be slightly angled, i.e. Your right hand should be angled to the left (at about 145 degrees), whereas your left hand should be angled to the right, or at a 45-degree angle.In brief, your hands should arch up slightly from the wrists, and your fingers should rest lightly on the âhome rowâ section of the keyboard.The home row keys along with the fingers that you should hit each letter with are as follows:


Your left index finger should rest on the letter F and should hit the characters: F, C, V, G, T, and 6.
Your left middle finger should rest on the letter D and should hit the characters: D, R, 5, and X.
Your left ring finger should rest on the letter S and should hit the characters: Z, E, 4, and 3.
Your left pinkie should rest on the letter A, and should hit the characters: A, \, Caps Lock, 2, 1, W, Q, Tab. Shift, and Ctrl.
Your right index finger should rest on the letter J and should hit the characters: 6, 7, U, J, N, M, H, Y, and B.
Your right middle finger should rest on the letter K and should hit the characters: K, I, 8, and the comma key.
Your right ring finger should rest on the letter L and should hit the characters: L, the full stop key, O, and 9.
Your right pinkie finger should rest on the semi-colon (;) key, and should hit the characters: semi-colon, P, /, 0, ', -, =, , #, Shift, Enter, Backspace, and the Ctrl key.
Left and right thumbs should rest on and press the space bar.

, One good way to help you get to know the positions of the keys without looking at them is to look away from the keys, and directly at the screen, and pronounce the keys as you press them. This will help you with the process of memorising the key positions. Keep doing it until you no longer need to say the letters as you press them., There are many ways to estimate your typing speed, which is usually measured in WPM (words per minute). The easiest is to simply type âwhat's my WPMâ into an Internet search and click one of the top links for a simple test. This will give you a starting point for your efforts.


Having a score as a benchmark will help to measure your progress over time.
Sometimes you will see your score presented in WAM (words a minute), rather than WPM. There is no difference between these terms.
Remember that WPM is best gauged over a set period of time. Typing for more or less time can change your WPM, so be consistent with the test you choose when you come back later to check your progress.

, Getting faster at typing is a matter of steadily developing your skill, and touch-typing (typing without looking at the keyboard) is generally the quickest way to type once you have mastered it. If you've never touch-typed before, that means you'll be spending quite a bit of time on this step. But once you can type without looking at keys youâll get much faster.It can be frustrating to start typing in this way and it may feel alien to you, but with some work and patience, you will improve.
Try to limit your finger movement only to what is needed to reach the keys., It's important to avoid looking at the keyboard as you type so that your fingers are forced to learn where the keys are through physical repetition. If you can't look away from the keyboard, try typing with a light cloth, such as a hand towel, draped over your hands instead.


You might even find you are slower than before at the start, but stick with it. Once you touch-type you will reach much higher speeds than with your original technique., Touch-typing is a tricky skill to master, but once you have got you fingers in the correct position on the keys and have your posture lined up nicely, the only way to improve is through practice. Take some time every day to practice touch typing and work on your speed and accuracy. Over time, your WPM will steadily increase.


If you can set aside just ten minutes a day where you open a document and type without stopping, you will notice you make fewer and fewer errors each time., There are a whole bunch of websites which have free typing games that you can practice on. They will normally give you a score and record your WPM too, so you can try to beat your record and compete with others doing the tests and games online., If you don't know what to type, one good way to practice is by listening to something and typing it out as you go. There is no end to sort of thing you could type, and this could be a good way to make practising more fun if you listen to something interesting, like an ebook, a lecture online, or a radio talk show.


Even a TV show could work, so be imaginative and try to make practice fun.

, Re-test yourself and keep track of your score for each week. You'll soon notice a gratifying upward trend. But donât get too obsessed with your WPM score, think about how comfortable you are and how much easier you are finding it to type quicker.

, There are a number of specially designed programs that can help you learn to touch type quickly. Most of these are either simple guided sessions or games whose outcomes are controlled by your typing speed and accuracy. If you're in a hurry to improve your typing, consider investing in one.


These programs come in all varieties. Free Internet typing tutors are widely available, but there are also free programs you can download, and a wide range of programs that cost money. Some are more fun than others, but all will help you improve your typing.
Ultimately, how quickly you improve will depend on how much you practice.

, Stick with it, and you might be able to rival the fastest touch typists, who can easily top 150 WPM over sustained periods, and upwards of 200 in short bursts. Good typing skills can be really useful both for work and for study. The quicker you can type accurately, the sooner will get that element of your task done.

Meet the home keys.,
Wiggle your two pointer fingers around the bottom of the 'F' and 'J' keys - you should notice a little bump.,
How do you know which finger to use when you press each key?,
Practice makes perfect!,
Download programs to help further improve your skills.",How to Teach Yourself to Touch Type," These are the most important keys used during touch typing - they are how you find your way around the keyboard. There are different home keys for different fingers.



 


On your left hand - Place your smallest (pinky) finger on the 'A' key, your ring finger (next one along) onto the 'S' key, your middle finger (longest finger) onto the 'D' key and your pointer finger (next to the thumb) onto the 'F' key.
On your right hand - Place your smallest (pinky) finger onto the ';' (semicolon) key, your ring finger onto the 'L' key, your middle finger onto the 'K' key and your pointer finger onto the 'J' key.
Your thumbs - Place both of your thumbs onto the space bar - but align each hand's thumb so it's roughly underneath the key it's pointer finger is on.;
, These are there so that touch typists can locate where the home keys are. So, if you're ever lost when you are trying to touch type, don't worry about looking down - just find the little bumps *Note: looking for the bumps on the keyboard?Not all computer keyboards have bumps especially if you have an older one.* The home keys are very important - as soon as you move a finger, for example you use your left middle finger (on the home key 'D') to type a letter (for example 'E'), you have to place that finger back onto it's home key straight after its use. It's just a general rule, but keeps your fingers together instead of all over the place.






Before starting a new sentence, place your finger back onto the home keys. This will allow yourself to know where you are on the board and make it much easier to navigate around the keys. It may seem a little unnatural at first, but it will become your second nature after practicing.

, The answer is, simple! Look back at your fingers again and place them on their home keys. Each of the home keys have both a key above them and a key underneath them.






For example the home key 'A' has the key 'Q' on top of it, and the key 'Z' underneath it. So, if you need to type 'quickly', you would use your left pinky to type 'Q', your right pointer to type 'U', your right middle to type ""I"", your left middle to type ""C"", your middle finger to type ""K"" (it's already a home key so no moving needs to be done), your right ring finger to type 'L' (again, already a home key so you don't have to move any fingers to get to this key) and finally , you use your right pointer for the 'Y' key.
So what fingers do you use for the spare keys that aren't on top or underneath any home keys? These keys are the 'Y', 'H', 'G', 'T' and 'B' keys. You simply use the pointer finger that is closest to that key! So you would use the right pointer to press the 'Y' key and the left pointer to press 'T'.
Your pointer fingers will be used quite a bit, but not for everything! All fingers will be used, and again it may seem unnatural, but all it takes is a bit of getting used to.

, Try closing your eyes, putting your fingers on the home keys (remember to find the bumps where your pointer fingers sit on at 'F' and 'J'!) and typing your first and last name onto a blank Word document. Open your eyes, have a look, and see how close you got... or how far away you were! Keep doing this until you get the hang of it. Then, start to type simple sentences, like ""The boy ate the apple"".






If you need to look at the screen, cover your hands with a tea towel so you are not tempted to look. Once you lose that temptation, try touch typing on your own!

Give it your all. Don't give up! It can be annoying if you keep getting something wrong, but keep your chin up. So what? If you stick to it, a couple of months later you would be an expert and would laugh at the memory!

, If there are any free demo or trial copies of professional programs, don't hesitate to give it a go! It can help a lot, and offer a whole new environment to type in. Try some free online typing tutors that offer different ranges of courses for all skill levels.

Find the ribbon spools.,
Remember the layout.,
Disengage the ribbon.,
Remove the ribbon and the spools.",How to Change a Typewriter Ribbon1," First, carefully lift the top ""bonnet"" of the typewriter. Then, look for the typewriter ribbon wound around two metal or plastic spools: much like the sort that you'd use for sewing thread or rope. The spools are set up in an S- shaped configuration on two axles. The ribbon itself stretches between the spools and through an aligning scale.


Remove your typewriter's cover by pressing it on both sides, next to the separating line. Press gently but firmly until the cover clicks open.The spools may be covered up in newer typewriter models. Look for a small clasp or button to remove this cover.;
, Before you take your typewriter apart, make sure that you know how to put it back together. Consider taking a photo of the insides to remind yourself later on. If you have access to a physical or online PDF copy of the typewriter manual, then this document should include basic instructions on how to change the ribbon., The process depends on what type pf typewriter you have. If you have a manual typewriter, then lift the spools directly out of the machine. On a cartridge typewriter, simply press the release lever to disengage the ribbon.To disengage the spools: simply pull them straight up out of the typewriter.
There may also be two additional spring-loaded metal pieces that hold the ribbon in place. They'll be located close to the ribbon spools. Apply pressure to finger-holds on these pieces, and you should be able to loosen the ribbon tension enough for you to pull it out., First, open the ribbon gate: the small piece of metal that holds the ribbon against the paper, where the keys will hit it. Then, pull the entire ribbon out of the machine. Be gentle so that you don't damage any of the components! Put the old ink cartridge to the side. Now, you are ready to install the new ribbon.

"
"
Procure a new ribbon.,
Load the new spools.,
Thread the new ribbon.,
Replace the lid.",How to Change a Typewriter Ribbon2," If you are using an older model of typewriter, then the hard part of this process will be actually sourcing an original ribbon that was designed for your particular machine. Search online for retailers that are selling compatible typewriter ribbons.


Check eBay and other online marketplaces. You can usually find a reputable seller to send you an appropriate ribbon. Check around your town for shops that sell paper supplies and ephemera.
Many manufacturers have ceased ribbon production due to last of orders. However, it never hurts to contact the company that made the machine!

, Wiggle them into place until they fit snugly. Be gentle. Simply reverse every step that you took to remove the old spools., Pull it through the wire that holds it in front of the roller. Look it around the spools and make sure that it's right-side up. Be careful and precise when engaging the ribbon: it must be lined up correctly for the typewriter to function.


If you are using a multi-toned ribbon, make sure that black stripe sits on top of the red stripe when you're installing the fabric.
Check that there are no twists in the ribbon!, Be careful not to jostle the spools or the ribbon out of place. Once the lid is back on, you're ready to type!

Understand the function of the ribbon.,
Watch the ink.",How to Change a Typewriter Ribbon3," Classic typewriters use a silk ribbon as an inkwell for the keys. The ribbons have a quite long lasting time, as the keys are not constantly hammering them in the same place. The ribbon moves around the spools each time that you clack a key: first from the left spool to the right, and after the left spool is empty and the right spool complete,


Your typewriter ribbon may only run black ink, or it may have a red portion. If you're mostly typing in black ink, then the black part of the ribbon will run out much more quickly.

, Notice when your typed words grow thin and pale. The ribbon won't wear through all at once â you should begin to see sporadic faint patches in your text. You can type around this for a time by spacing back and double-typing over the inkless letters. However: you may as well change your typewriter ribbon once you begin to notice that the machine is running out of ink.

Practice your technique.",How to Type Extremely Fast on a Keyboard," Your fingers should curve over the keys with your wrists lightly resting on the desk. In other words, don't put too much pressure on your wrists. Sit up straight with your elbows bent. Correct posture helps you to be more accurate, but it also helps lessen strain on your arms, hands, and shoulders over time., When at rest, your four fingers on each hand rest on certain keys, called the home row or base position. Your left hand fingers should rest on the keys A, S, D, and F, starting with the pinky on the A, while your right hand fingers should rest on J, K, L, andÂ ;, starting with your pointer finger on the J. By keeping your fingers on these home keys when you are resting, you always know where all the letters are. Additionally, it is easy to reach most of the letters on the keyboard from this position.


If you already type using all your fingers, make sure you're always landing on the right keys. If you aren't, practice returning to this position.
Most keyboards have a little raised bump on the ""F"" and ""J"" keys to help you return your fingers to the correct position without glancing down., Basically, each finger types the diagonal that slants down to the right. For instance, the pinky on the left hand types the letters and number 1, Q, A, and Z, while the ring finger types 2, W, S, and X. Both pointer fingers also type the adjoining row in addition to their own row. For example, the right pointer finger types 7, U, J, and M, as well as 6, Y, H, and N. , Usually, you use the pinky on the opposite hand of the letter you are typing. You also use your pinky to hit keys like the ""Tab"" key, the ""Caps Lock, "" and the ""CTRL"" key on the left side, as well as most of the punctuation keys, the ""Backspace"" key, and the arrow keys., You should never have to take both hands off of the space bar at the same time. Keeping a thumb on the space bar means you do not have to shift your hands around to create a space between words, saving you time.

, Try typing the alphabet in order to get a feel for where the letters are. Once you've done it a few times while looking at the keyboard, try doing it without looking.

, Use a favorite poem you have memorized, or try typing the lyrics to your favorite song.

, For instance, trying using pangrams such as ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" A pangram is a sentence or phrase that has all letters of the alphabet; therefore, it is useful for tasks like typing, since it requires you to type all the letters. , If you're typing an email, try to avoid the hunt-and-peck method. Challenge yourself to use all your fingers. Once you become more proficient, do it without looking. It may take you longer, but it will help you learn how to type better in the long run.


Always be sure to check your email for mistakes after practicing your technique. You are going to make mistakes as you learn, but you can quickly fix them before sending it off.

, These programs make learning the proper technique a game, encouraging you to keep learning.

, As you're learning, periodically slow down and spend a few minutes practicing with an even rhythm, using one beat per letter. Practicing a steady rhythm helps build the muscle memory that you will need when you type faster. , If you keep making the same mistake when typing certain words or letter combinations, check your hand position to see if its correct. Also, look at the tension in your fingers. You might be accidentally bearing down on a letter or the space bar while striking another key.

, It takes time to learn to type. It can take awhile to build up your typing speed.

, Looking at the keyboard slows you down, as it stops your muscle memory from taking over. If you feel the need to look down at the keyboard, try to limit it to when you are starting a sentence to check for finger position, For instance, Rapid Typing Tutor is a program designed with multiple levels to help increase your speed over time., Practice regularly to build up your muscle memory, as muscle memory is what makes you faster.

, By trying to keep up with a typed conversation, you will increase your speed over time., That is, the harder you press on the keys, the more time it takes for you to type each letter. Most keyboards are fairly sensitive, so you only need to press the keys lightly. As an added bonus, typing lighter will help save your hands from getting so tired., The proper posture will continue to increase your speed, especially wrist angle and rest.

, Even if you feel like you have it down, it never hurts to revisit the technique to ensure you are doing everything properly.

Find a keyboard that you're comfortable with.,
Familiarize yourself with the keyboard.,
Arrange your fingers properly.,
Use the proper fingers to strike the other keys.,
Practice regularly.,
Take regular breaks.",How to Improve Typing Speed1," Keyboards come in different shapes, including ergonomic models that may be feel more comfortable while youâre typing. If you arenât typing effectively with your current keyboard, you may want to test some ergonomic keyboards to find one that offers more comfort while youâre working.Keep the size of the keys in mind. The larger they are, the easier it will be to type. That means you may want to look for a keyboard where the keys that you use most often, such as the letters and numbers, are larger than other keys.A keyboard with concave keys that fit the shape of your fingers is a good option if you're looking to eliminate errors in your typing as you try to increase your speed.
It's best to choose a keyboard with keys that have strong tactile feedback, which means they offer enough resistance to alert you that the stroke has registered. The resistance also keeps you from accidentally hitting keys as you're typing, so you can type more quickly.;
, While most keyboards have a fairly standard set-up, some may have different features or different layouts. Make sure to read the instructions or manual that comes with your keyboard so you know what all of the keys do and what shortcuts may be useful to you. Once you understand what all of the keys do, try to create a visual layout of the keyboard in your mind that you can call upon when youâre typing.Many keyboards are equipped with time-saving keys that provide shortcuts for common commands or keystrokes. Be sure to read up on your keyboard's shortcuts to help increase your speed.

, The most important step to improving your typing speed is ensuring that you place your fingers correctly on the keyboard. Rest the index finger of your left hand on the âFâ key and the index finger of your right hand on the âJâ key. These two keys usually have slight bumps on their surface, so you can feel for them without actually looking at the keyboard. The other three fingers on your left hand should rest on the âA,â âS,â and âDâ keys, while the the other three fingers on your right hand should rest on the âK,â âL,â and â;â keys. Place your thumbs on the space bar.The row with the âA,â âS,â âD,â âF,â âJ,â âK,â âL,â and â;â keys is known as the home run because itâs the row that your fingers always start at and return to while youâre typing.
When you arrange your fingers on the keyboard, curve them slightly, but keep your hands relaxed.
Make sure that your keyboard is centered directly in front of your body.

, When youâre typing, you will hit all of the keys on your keyboard from the home position. That means certain fingers are designated to strike certain keys for the most efficient typing. In most cases, youâll use the same fingers from the home row to hit the keys that line up in the rows above and below.Strike the â1,â â2,â âQ,â and âZâ keys, in addition to the âAâ key, with your left pinky.
Strike the â3,â âWâ, and âXâ keys, in addition to the âSâ key, with your left ring finger.
Strike the â4,â âEâ, and âCâ keys, in addition to the âDâ key, with your left middle finger.
Strike the â5,â â6,â âR,â âT,â âG,â âV,â and âBâ keys, in addition to the âFâ key, with your left index finger.

Hit the âShiftâ key with the pinky on the opposite hand from the finger that youâre using to strike the other key.
Hit the spacebar with whichever thumb feels most comfortable to you.

, As with most skills, the only way to truly improve your typing speed is to practice on a regular basis. The more that you type, the more comfortable youâll become with the layout of the keyboard and the proper positioning of your fingers. You'll also develop muscle memory when you're typing common letter combinations, so your typing will become faster and more accurate.One of the best ways to practice is to repeatedly type sample passages over and over again. You can find plenty of passages online that are geared toward improving your typing accuracy and speed.
When you're practicing, focus on accuracy first. Make sure that you're typing each word correctly and achieving proper spacing and punctuation. Once you feel like your typing has become accurate, you can work on improving your speed.
Practice doesnât just mean taking online typing tests. Writing emails to friends and family and posting on online forums can help sharpen your typing skills and increase your speed.

, While practicing is key to improving your typing speed, make sure to take breaks as needed. If you push yourself too hard, you run the risk of wearing yourself out, or even worse, suffering an injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. When you start to feel any discomfort in your hands or wrists, stop typing for a little while to give yourself time to rest.To keep yourself from working too hard, set up a practice schedule by designating a certain amount of time each day to practice your typing. However, build breaks into your schedule to keep yourself fresh. For example, you might decide to type for 30 minutes each day, taking breaks every ten minutes or so.

Keep your eyes on the screen.,
Take online typing tests.,
Use touch typing software and games.,
Find a typing class.",How to Improve Typing Speed2," Your natural instinct may be to look down at the keyboard as youâre typing. However, looking at the keys actually slows down your typing and increases the chance of errors. As you type, keep your eyes on the screen instead to use the technique known as touch typing. You may see a slight increase in errors when your first start using this method, but youâll quickly learn the layout of the keyboard and position of the keys, which will improve your typing speed.When learning how to type without looking at the keyboard, consider covering your hands with a cloth, piece of paper, or cardboard, so you're unable to see the keys even if you peek.
While you should try to keep your gaze on the computer screen as much as possible, itâs okay to cheat occasionally and glance down at the keyboard to ensure that you know where the keys are.

, If you want to see how efficient your typing is, you can use a variety of online typing tests to see how you rate. In most cases, youâll be asked to type a certain passage of text, and the website will time you to determine how many words per minute (wpm) you type and how accurate your typing is. These programs are an effective way to track your progress as you work to improve your typing speed.Some online typing tests that are available for free include Typing.com, TypingMaster, and TypingWeb.

, You'll be able to type most quickly if you do it by feel instead of sight. That's why it helps to use touch typing software to help refine your typing skills so you can work more quickly. They usually include helpful exercises and even fun games that can make increasing your typing speed more enjoyable.

Make sure your back is supported.,
Relax your neck and shoulders.,
Keep your elbows close to your sides.,
Place your feet flat on the floor.,
Keep your wrists and palms off the desk.,
Ensure that your keyboard is at the right height.",How to Improve Typing Speed3," When youâre typing, itâs important to choose a chair that provides proper support for your back. The best type of chair is one that features a slightly curved backrest so it helps maintain your normal spine curvature. It also helps to use a chair that has a cushion built in near the bottom of the backrest to provide support for your lower back.You may prefer reclining slightly in your chair to help take pressure off your back. However, keep in mind that typing in a reclined position may cause shoulder and neck strain. Moving your chair closer to the desk can help alleviate some of that stress.
If your chair doesnât have a built-in cushion for your lower back, you can place a small pillow between your back and the chair for additional support.

, As you sit in your chair to type, make sure to keep your shoulders and neck relaxed. In most cases, you can accomplish this by sitting back against your chairâs backrest. It will help support your neck and shoulders, so you donât have to put stress on them to keep them straight.If youâre not sure that your shoulders are relaxed, breathe in and out slowly. The position that your shoulders naturally fall in as your breathe out is usually relaxed.

, As you get comfortable in your desk chair, check that youâre keeping your elbows tucked into your sides. You may want to use a chair that has adjustable arm rests that make it easy to keep your elbows comfortably at your sides.You donât have to use your chairâs arm rests if you donât want to. Just make sure that your elbows remain close to your sides even without the added support.

, Once youâre settled in your chair, it helps to sit up straight with your feet planted flat on the floor so your lower body is supported. Crossing your legs or folding one underneath you make it more difficult to maintain proper posture. If you have a chair with adjustable seat, adjust the height until your feet comfortably reach the floor.If your chair doesnât have an adjustable seat, you may want to purchase an ergonomic footrest that makes it easier to keep your feet in a flat position.

, When you're typing, you'll be able to work more quickly and accurately if you avoid resting your wrists or palms on the desk or other surface that your keyboard is on. Keep them elevated, but don't bend them up or down because that may cause discomfort. Instead, keep your wrists in a neutral position, with your thumb in line with your forearm and your wrist slightly bent back so theyâre level with the keyboard.Some keyboard and keyboard trays are equipped with wrist pads, but they're not there for you to rest your wrists on as you type. They're only for brief breaks when you're not typing. If you must rest your hand on the wrist pad, try to place your palm on it rather than your wrist.
If your chair has adjustable arm rests, set them so that your forearms are parallel to the floor and your wrist is a neutral position.

, For the most effective typing, your keyboard should be just above lap level, which is lower than most people actually set theirs up. The benefit to placing your keyboard at this height is that it allows you to tilt your arms down so your elbows are in an open, 90 degree angle.You may want to invest in an adjustable keyboard and mouse tray that you can attach to your desk or work surface. That will allow you to position the keyboard at the most comfortable height.
If you don't have a keyboard tray, try adjusting your chair's height to make your position more comfortable.

Ã¯ = 0239; Ã = 0207
Ã¶ = 0246; Ã = 0214
Ã¼ = 0252; Ã = 0220
Ã¿ = 0255; Å¸ = 0159

, The accent will appear above the corresponding letter as shown. Learning the accent codes can take some practice as there are many to remember. You can make a cheat sheet to keep by your computer so you can reference it quickly if you need to use accents often. If you use accents frequently, you should reconfigure the keyboard to better suit your typing needs.

, Place the text in a word processing document. Make sure you have at least 100 words of text. Skip below it to type, making sure you can still read what's at the top. You can also create custom typing tests using certain websites. You just enter the text you want, and it creates a test., You can use any way to time 1 minute, but just make sure you can easily start it and stop it to be exactly 1 minute of typing. Set the timer beside you., Set the timer for 1 minute. If you are having to deal with starting the timer by hand, you might build in a 5-second buffer so you have time to get set on your keyboard before the actual minute begins.You can actually set the timer for any amount you want. However, 1 minute gives you words per minute without dividing out the time, so you don't need to do extra math besides calculating the number of words.For instance, you can set it for 3 to 5 minutes so you can be sure to hit your rhythm. In that case, you'll need more text., .Type as much of the text as you can before the timer is up. You can correct mistakes. However, that will slow you down. Mistakes will count against your final score., Don't worry about errors at this point. You can use your word processing software to figure it out.In your word processing software, highlight the text you typed. Find the ""word count"" tool. Usually, you can click in the bottom left-hand corner. Locate the number of characters you typed.Divide the number of characters you typed by 5. You don't just use the word count because some words are much longer. Therefore, you use an average of 5 characters per word.For instance, if you have 225 characters, divide that by 5 to get 45 words.

, Look through your text and count errors. An error is any misspelled word, any missing punctuation, or basically any mistake, including missed capitalization or spaces., Using the number of errors, take it away from the number of words you typed. Therefore, if you made 5 errors, subtract that from 45 to get 40., If you did your test for 1 minute, then this part is simple. You divide by 1. In other words, you don't really need to divide at all. Your words per minute is 40. If you choose a different amount of time, divide by that number of minutes., Most online typing tests are fairly similar. One of the main differences is how it's timed. For example, a test on the website Typing Test has you type for a specific period of time.On the other hand, a test like Key Hero has you type for the length of a quote.Both work just fine for calculating your speed.

, Most tests let you pick your text from a few samples, such as on Typing Test.Others auto-populate a test for you, but you can skip any you don't like., With some tests, you'll need to set how long you'd like to type. A minute is usually sufficient, though you can set it for longer if you think you'll need time to get in the groove of typing., Once you have the test set up, all you need to do is type. Try to take a deep breath first, so you don't psych yourself out. When you are done with the quote or you have finished the allotted time, the test will let you know and then give you your score."

Be polite.,
Explain that you don't know them well enough.,
Decline because you can't recommend them.,
Tell the truth.,
Keep your conversation concise.",How to Turn Down a Reference Request1," Itâs always possible to be both polite and honest. Choose your words carefully, and stick to the point. Keep in mind that the person is asking you because he or she thinks you will provide a good recommendation. Your refusal may cause hurt and disappointment, but courtesy and kindness may soften the blow.Thereâs no reason to say, âNo way, you were a terrible employee, and we all hated you!â
Instead you might say, ""Based on our past experiences, I can't in good conscience give you the recommendation you seek.""
Instead of âNo way!,â say âI canât do that.â;
, Outlining your reasons for saying no can help ease the situation. If you are turning down the request because you do not know the person well enough, thatâs a relatively easy situation to handle.You might say, âSince we havenât worked together long, I donât think I would be able to provide a strong enough reference for you.â

, If you are turning down the request because the personâs performance does not merit a recommendation, thatâs a bit trickier. Ultimately, though, you need to be honest. Perhaps your refusal will prompt them to work harder in the future. You might simply say, âI donât feel comfortable providing a strong reference for you.â

, Lying might resolve the situation temporarily, but itâs likely to catch up to you. Ultimately, it does not help you or the person who needs the reference. You donât need to be blunt to the point of rudeness, but you should not invent excuses for turning the person down., You can probably explain yourself in a sentence or two. You donât need to expand on your reasons or lecture the person unnecessarily. Simply say no, state your reason briefly, and consider suggesting someone else."
"
Resist the urge to apologize.,
Consider suggesting alternative references.,
Stick to your decision.",How to Turn Down a Reference Request2," People tend to apologize excessively when they feel uncomfortable. Apologizing once is acceptable, but saying you are sorry again and again does not help the person. It only makes the situation more awkward.Remember you are not doing anything wrong.

, If you feel comfortable doing so, you can suggest that the person ask someone else. Recommending someone else works best if you are turning down the request because you donât know the person well enough. This also helps to make it clear that your decision is final.You might say, âTry asking Jill. Sheâs worked with you for much longer than I have.â
If you canât recommend the person based on his or her performance, try suggesting alternatives. Turn down the request and follow up with âPerhaps Amy might be able to help.â

, Once you have turned someone down for a reference, do not reconsider just because the person begs, argues, or otherwise attempts to change your mind. If you give in, youâll only wind up in a trickier situation: providing a difficult reference that compromises your integrity. Stay strong!"

Consider switching to a Dvorak keyboard.",How to Type," This can be tough, especially if you've been using the two-finger typing method since you first came in contact with a computer or if you're a gamer who uses only your left hand for clicking the WASD keys. However, if you want to type quickly and accurately, you'll need to drop those habits and start with a clean slate.






;
, That's the position in which your fingers will rest between keystrokes. No matter what part of the keyboard you're using, your fingers will always come back to rest in this position.









Place your right index finger on the ""J"" key and let the other three fingers fall naturally onto the ""K"", ""L"" and "";"" keys respectively. Place your left index finger on the ""F"" key and let the other three finger fall naturally onto the ""D"", ""S"", and ""A"" keys respectively. Both thumbs should rest on the space bar, but only the right thumb should key it.
You should feel a raised bump on both the ""F"" and ""J"" keys. These will allow your fingers to find the home position without having to look at the keyboard.

, Type each letter covered by the fingers in the home position, going from left to right: a s d f j k lÂ ;. You shouldn't have to move your fingers from their home positions. Just press the keys they are resting on.








, Repeat the step above, but this time in capital letters: A S D F J K LÂ :. Use the shift key to capitalize rather than the caps lock. Push the shift key by moving only your nearest pinkie finger and pressing and holding it while pushing the desired letter with your other hand.









In other words, when the letter you would like capitalized is typed with your left hand, you press the right shift key with your right pinkie.
When the letter you would like capitalized is typed with your right hand, you press the left shift key with your left pinkie.

, Learn where each letter is positioned on the keyboard, and use the nearest finger to contact each key. (The thumbs are never the nearest finger; they are used only on the space bar.)









""q"" ""a"" and ""z"" are typed with the left pinkie, and so are the tab, caps lock, and shift keys.
""w"" ""s"" and ""x"" are typed with the left ring finger.
""e"" ""d"" and ""c"" are typed with the left middle finger.
""r"" ""f"" ""v"" ""b"" ""g"" and ""t"" are typed with the left index finger.
Your thumbs should never leave the space bar.
""u"" ""j"" ""n"" ""m"" ""h"" and ""y"" are typed with your right index finger.
""i"" ""k"" and the keys with "","" and ""<"" are typed with the right middle finger.
""o"" ""l"" and the keys with "">"" and ""."" are typed with the right ring finger.
Your right pinkie finger is used for typing: ""p"", "";"", "":"", ""'"", """""" (a quotation mark), ""/"", ""?"", """", ""}"", ""\"", ""|"", and is used for pressing the shift, enter, and backspace keys.

, Starting from the home position, type: ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"". This sentence contains every letter in the alphabet, so it's a perfect sentence for practicing the correct finger positioning.









Type the sentence over and over, watching your fingers to make sure they go to the right keys and immediately return to home position.
Once you begin to feel comfortable with the way your fingers are moving, try to look at the screen while you type rather than looking at the keyboard. This is known as touch typing.

, Learning how to touch type is the single most important factor in increasing your speed. In fact, as you become a better typist, looking down at the keyboard will actually slow you down. At first this may seem difficult, but train yourself to look only at the screen as you type.









It will be slow at first, and you may need to sneak a peek at the keyboard from time to time, but soon your fingers will be able to find the right keys without much difficulty.
A good tip during this early stage is to say the name of the letter as you type it. This will help your brain associate that letter with the appropriate finger movement.

, Speed is pointless if you have to go back and correct mistakes after every sentence. This is why it's essential that you focus more on accuracy than on speed in the beginning.









If you make a mistake, go back and correct it immediately. Try to do so without looking at the keyboard.
If you find you are making a lot of mistakes, slow down. Your first priority should be 100% accuracy.

, Although you may get the hang of typing letters pretty quickly, you may still feel uncomfortable with some of the less frequently used keys, such as the symbols and numbers.









If you don't learn how to use these additional keys properly, you will find that they will slow you down for the rest of your life. To avoid this, make sure to incorporate all of the less commonly used keys into your typing practice.

, Don't smash the keyboard; that is, don't just hit keys without aiming first. This will often result in pressing two keys at once.









Avoid thumping your fingers down each time. Your fingers and hands will soon grow weary and it'll feel like a chore instead of a tool. In other words, don't hit the keys. Tap them.

, Things like copying, pasting, saving and highlighting can all slow you down as you type. Luckily, there are some handy shortcuts you can use to perform these actions without lifting your fingers from the keyboard. Some of the most common ones are as follows:










Save: Ctrl + s (which means to hold down the ""ctrl"" key and simultaneously tap the ""s"" key)

Copy: Ctrl + c

Cut: Ctrl + x

Paste: Ctrl + v

Undo: Ctrl + z

Highlight next letter: Shift + left arrow or right arrow

Highlight next word: Ctrl + shift + right arrow or left arrow

, The best way to learn is by practicing, so spend at least ten minutes every day at the keyboard.


It won't take long to improve your typing, and once you've got the hang of it you'll never return to your old habits.
Don't forget to practice numbers and symbols. Type phone numbers and addresses, and incorporate the use of the various symbols just to practice them. The more keystrokes you work on, the more advanced your typing becomes.

, Here are some traditional typing lines that help you to master the art of typing. Repeat each line numerous times without looking at the keyboard. Then move on to the next one. This will help you to ""memorize"" the keys themselves, rather than the pattern of specific words.

Make sure that your keyboard is at a comfortable height for your fingers. Your hands should be about level with your sides while you type, maybe a little above your middle.
Keep your wrists elevated. A wrist support can help if you can't remember to do it self-supported. There is an array of supports available, such as cushions or foam bars, or you can improvise by placing a book so that it raises your wrist to a height almost level with the keyboard. You'll move faster and have fewer errors.
Sit up straight and put your feet flat on the ground.

, At first you'll probably use a traditional QWERTY keyboard, but there's also the option of switching to a Dvorak keyboard.


The standard QWERTY layout was designed to prevent typewriter jams (which is no longer necessary with computers), whereas the Dvorak layout was designed specifically to be easy on the hands.
However, if you share your computer with others or if you frequently switch computers, you may find the changed layout confusing.
More information on typing on a Dvorak keyboard can be found here.

Figure out what kind of operating system you have.,
Change to the Dvorak keyboard layout on Windows.,
Change to the Dvorak keyboard layout on your Mac.,
Practice switching between QWERTY and Dvorak.",How to Switch to a Dvorak Keyboard Layout1," The good news is that the Dvorak format is already configured into your operating system, so you don't have to download anything special to access it. Although QWERTY is the automatic setting, all you need to do is to change between the layouts. , To change to the Dvorak format on Windows XP, follow these steps: Click the ""start"" button> Control Panel> Regional and Language Options> ""Languages"" tab> ""Details"" button >""Add"" button (under ""Settings"" tab)> in ""Keyboard layout/IME"" scroll to United States-Dvorak and click ""OK"".

Buy a Dvorak keyboard.,
Buy a Dvorak keyboard slip.,
Put stickers on your existing keyboard.You can also buy keyboard stickers that stick to your keys.,
Make keyboard stickers.",How to Switch to a Dvorak Keyboard Layout2," Once you have made the change to Dvorak in your operating system, you may want to purchase a new keyboard. Although eventually you will not need to look at the keyboard to type comfortably, it may be useful in the beginning to have a keyboard labelled for the Dvorak type setting.A Dvorak keyboard is no different internally from your current keyboard; the only difference is that the keys are labelled according to the Dvorak format. These keyboards can be bought at Staples or online on Amazon.

, If you do not want to buy a new keyboard, you can just buy a Dvorak keyboard slip. These slips are fit right over your keyboard and are labelled according to a Dvorak keyboard setting. They can be found on Amazon. This is a good option if you are using a laptop because the keyboard is built in, so buying a new keyboard would probably not be the best option.

, You can put each letter over the keys of your keyboard so that the keyboard is labelled like a Dvorak keyboard. These stickers are designed for the shape of the keys and will not come off.

, If you are feeling crafty, you can go to a store like Staples, buy stickers or labels, write letters on them, and stick them to your keyboard. This is a cheaper option than buying a keyboard or a keyboard slip. You will also easily be able to peel them off to see your QWERTY keys if you decide to switch back.

Learn where to put your fingers to type.,
Don't ""peck"".,
Start slow.,
Print out a picture of the Dvorak keyboard.,
Cut back on looking at the keyboard.,
Use online resources to learn.,
Practice, practice, practice!",How to Switch to a Dvorak Keyboard Layout3," If you already know how to touch-type on a QWERTY, the same fingers operate the same keys. The keys just produce different letters. The home row is:


Dvorak: AOEU - ID - HTNS
QWERTY: ASDF - GH - JKL
If you lose track of where to put your fingers, search for the raised dots on the keyboard. In the Dvorak keyboard format, they are on U and H. Put your left index finger on U and your right on H to bring your fingers back to the home row.

, Don't use one finger to find and ""peck"" at the letters of the keyboard when you are learning how to type. Keep your fingers on the keyboard and use the same fingers to reach keys as you do on the QWERTY keyboard. Since you aren't used to the keyboard you might be tempted, but don't do it! If you type like that, you'll never learn how to type correctly using Dvorak and you will not be able to type quickly or comfortably. , You're just learning this keyboard layout, so it's not expected that you can type fast! Taking the time you need is actually better than speeding through and making mistakes. By being accurate, you are beginning to create a muscle memory with your fingers that eventually will allow you to type without even thinking about what to do with your fingers.

, As you're learning, put a Dvorak keyboard diagram next to you. This will save you time because you won't have to keep moving your fingers out of the way to see the keyboard letters. It also might help your visual memory of how the keyboard looks., As you get faster and more confident at typing, don't look down at the keyboard until you make a mistake. This will help you to develop touch-type so you eventually won't have to look down at the keyboard at all.

, Learning the Dvorak layout will be challenging. Luckily, there is a wide array of resources available through the internet that can help you learn. Videos are an especially useful resource because you can follow along with them.


Youtube has an array of videos meant to help you learn Dvorak typing. These videos are free and readily available.
If you prefer a series of lessons, there are some good programs that teach Dvorak programs.You can do some research to help you find the best program for your needs. Make sure you go through lessons at a reasonable pace. Although the lessons may be easy, do them multiple times to ensure you have mastered everything they offer., Try to use Dvorak as much as possible, even if you hate how slow it is at first Practice will make you more familiar with the keyboard layout. Practicing for small amounts of time, such as fifteen minutes per day is more effective than practicing for hours once a week.Make practicing fun. Instead of calling a friend, talk to her on instant message or Facebook chat. This is a way of making practicing less tedious. "

Distribute the letter.",How to Verbally Give Two Weeks' Notice," Hopefully, youâll catch your boss in a good mood, but thereâs no guarantee. Think about giving notice on Friday. This leaves the weekend for your boss to cool down and adjust to the news.


If you have a formal relationship with your boss, you might need to schedule a meeting with his secretary. Tell the secretary you need to schedule a short meeting and that itâs important.
Also give notice when you are coming to the end of large projects.You need to leave your job gracefully, which means wrapping up loose ends on any unfinished work.;
, Youâre probably nervous about quitting your job. Accordingly, you should prepare ahead of time what you will tell your boss. You should follow these rules:


Donât go negative. Now is not the time to unload on your boss, even if you hated your job. The past is in the past, and you need to adopt a positive attitude.
Keep it simple. You donât need to go into a long, detailed story about why you are leaving. Youâve decided to make the switchâthatâs all your boss is entitled to know.
Identify something youâre grateful for. If possible, you should thank your boss for giving you the job. Mention one or two things youâve learned.

, When the big day arrives, walk confidently to your bossâ door and knock. Say, âGreg, can we talk for a minute?â Smile and shut the door behind you for privacy. As soon as you sit down, begin with some small talk about the upcoming weekend or any big event.Hopefully, you havenât told anyone else at work that you have accepted a new job. If you have, then your boss might already know. Also, your new employer might have called for a reference.
If your boss says, âYouâre leaving, right?â just roll with it. Smile and nod your head.

, Screw up your courage and tell your boss that youâre leaving. Use simple language so that you are easily understood.Avoid being overly apologetic.


For example, you can say, âI want to let you know that Iâve accepted a job at XYZ Marketing. It begins in two weeks.â
Give your boss a second to respond, if they have anything to say.

, If you were a good employee, you should expect your boss to try and keep you.They might make a counteroffer for more money or more time off. You should politely decline and explain that youâve made up your mind.


For example, you can say, âThanks for the offer, but Iâve already made up my mind. Itâs not really the money, but the opportunity to advance. They said theyâd consider me for a promotion after three months and Iâm excited to get started.â

, Your boss is a future reference, as well as a potential business associate in the future. In fact, you donât know where your paths will cross again. Accordingly, you want to leave on the best terms possible. To that end, thank your boss for the help they have given you.For example, you can say, âIâd never have gotten this job if you hadnât hired me right out of college. I really appreciate it. What Iâve learned here will be the foundation of my success.â

, Before leaving, you want to clarify how the rest of the office will be told. If itâs a big company, your boss might want to send an email. If you work in a small office, your boss might want to tell everyone at a team meeting.


Ideally, you will tell people who are important to you in person. Ask your boss to hold off on the email until youâve had a chance to speak to them.

, You might need to write a letter to Human Resources to make your resignation official. Ask your boss if you need to write a letter and who you should address it to.

, Identify anyone who has acted as an official or unofficial mentor. Also identify people who maybe helped you get the job in the first place or helped you get a promotion. You should tell these people that you are leaving your job. Stop by their office so you can talk in person.You should also make sure they have your new work email address. Mentoring should continue even after you leave your job.
Remember to thank them for helping you. Say something like, âYouâve been the best sounding board, Kathy. I hope we stay in touch.â

, You should next tell colleagues you were close to. Chances are youâll maintain some sort of relationship outside of work, so you donât want them to be insulted that you havenât told them personally.Stop into their office and break the news.

, You arenât obligated to tell others why you are leaving, but they will want to know nonetheless. Accordingly, you should settle on a story and stick with it.Your colleagues will talk to each other and compare notes. Donât tell one person youâre leaving because you canât take the stress but tell another person youâre leaving because the commute is shorter.


Ideally, you should settle on a story that is non-controversial. For example, you can simply say, âThey promised promotion opportunities which I want to pursue.â Everyone can understand why you would want to leave for that reason.
Whatever you do, donât badmouth anyone, not even over drinks after work. If you need to vent, then call up your parents or therapist.

, If other people need to know that youâre leaving, you can let them know by email. Keep it brief and friendly. Tell them your last day and ask them to contact you if they have questions.


For example, other team members you work with occasionally should probably get an individual email. They might need to check about the status of a project.
If youâre pressed for time, you can send one email and blind copy everyone on it. However, individual emails are better if you have time.

, Never send out an email to people you donât know. In larger companies, itâs particularly awkward to read a good-bye email from someone youâve never met before. Let your boss or Human Resources inform these people that you are leaving.


Absolutely fight the urge to trash the company in a good-bye email. No matter how angry you are, nothing good has ever come from these stunts. Sometimes, they even end up in the news.

, Set up your letter as a standard business letter.Choose a font that is readable, such as Times New Roman 12 point.


Your boss should have told you who to address the letter to. If you donât know, then call Human Resources to check.
Donât delay writing the letter. You should draft it as soon as you tell your boss.

, In the first sentence, you should state that you are leaving and identify your last day.You donât want the give the impression that youâre open to a counter-offer or other negotiations to keep you with the company.


For example, you can write, âI hereby resign as marketing assistant at ABC Corporation, effective May 22, 2017.â

, Even if youâre writing the letter to Human Resources, you should thank the company. This letter will go in your personnel file, and you donât want to come across as ungrateful.You can thank your boss for hiring you and for anything else that youâre genuinely grateful for.


For example, you can write, âI canât thank you enough for hiring me nine months ago as your marketing assistant. This job allowed me to put my college education immediately to work, while teaching me more than four years of college ever could.â

, There might be negative comments or performance evaluations in your personnel file.Now is the time to correct the record by providing context.


For example, if youâve been criticized in the past for being tardy, you can subtly explain why. You can write something like, âThis company has been incredibly understanding. Even when I was going through chemotherapy and missing some time at work, I still managed to finish all of my work, thanks to the thoughtful staff at ABC Corp.â
Remember to keep it brief and professional. You shouldnât give a long-winded defense in which you go point-by-point and rebut every criticism ever made of you. Instead, explain away one or two of the major criticisms.

, Also let the company know whether youâre open to them contacting you with questions. If you are, provide your phone number and email address.


For example, you can write, âThanks again for the nine months to learn and grow with this company. I wouldnât be where I am today without the help of my direct supervisor, Greg Jones, and my co-workers Caron Smith and Abbi Johnson.â

, Make a copy of the letter for your records and then hand deliver it to Human Resources. You should also give your boss a copy of the letter so that they can read what you have written.

Assess why you want to transfer.,
Evaluate your reasons.,
Network and build strong relationships.,
Research and apply for internal job openings.,
Be upfront with your supervisor.,
Take the interview seriously.,
Follow proper interview etiquette.,
Follow through with your old job.,
Tie up loose ends.,
Show your replacement the ropes.",How to Transfer Jobs," What is your basic motivation? Are you bored? Disaffected? Do you need a bigger challenge? Is your job too demanding and you want a better work-life balance? Be sure that you are making an educated decision. Transferring departments is doable â for example, 1/3 of the British grocery chain Sainsburyâs 500 yearly recruits for retail management transfer to other operations-- but you should have a good reason. Try putting your thoughts on paper. Donât over-think or over-rationalize. Write down why you feel the need to move, emotions and all.;
, Now that youâve stated your reasons, it is time to decide whether they are legitimate. Understand that some reasons to transfer are good and others not as good. For example, you may be new to your department and not feel suited to the job. Improper fit is a legitimate reason to transfer. So is the desire for a greater challenge or the need to balance your life. Simple boredom or unhappiness need more thought, though. All jobs have ups and downs. What is behind your boredom? Is it something that might change after a time, like routine? Or is it a bigger problem, like you feel unchallenged and unmotivated?


More good reasons to transfer include relocating to different state or part of town, seeking better team or department fit, issues with your direct supervisor, and striving to meet career goals your current job cannot offer.Less compelling reasons include taking issue with company policies or procedures, ethical concerns, or problems with executive level management. None of the above will change much with a transfer and you may find yourself leaving the company shortly after transferring.
Do not be think that a transfer will be a quick fix for your personal and/or work issues. If your issues wind up being company-wide, the grass may not be greener on the other side.
It may be harder to transfer if you work for a small company, where many co-workers are âlifersâ and roles are clearly set. In that case, an external move might be better., Network with those you are interested in working with to help your chances of landing a transfer. Building genuine, mutual connections and making yourself known will help you find advocates â advocates who can promote your cause.Get to know the people in departments or locations in which you have an interest. For example, if you are interested in accounting, casually say so the next time you bump into the hiring manager in the break room. If you make it clear that you are interested, he may alert you the next time a new financial analyst position opens up. Keep in mind that knowing an insider will not get you hired, but that it may get you a close look.


Networking can be easier at a small company, with fewer steps. Does your boss or the owner do all the hiring herself? Talk to her frankly about your interest. If she is amenable, she might come directly to you the next time she is looking to hire. She may even allow you to apply before others.

, Many companies make job openings available to current employees before they are advertised outside of the company. Be on the lookout for such postings. Try to find them on the company intranet, in the break room, or by asking HR. Use your network to get info. For example, if youâd like to transfer to the marketing department and sometimes talk with Sarah in marketing as part of your current job, ask her about possible openings. Even if nothing is available at the moment, she may alert you in the future when a job opens. If you know someone in HR, mention your interest there. Once you have found a suitable position, put forward a professional application. But be discreet â other people you know will apply for the same vacancy.Take the process seriously. The biggest mistake you can make is to assume that you will get special consideration as a âknown entity.â In fact, this might actually make things harder, as no one wants to be accused of cronyism. Act as you would with any outside job. Follow the process, submit an up-to-date resume, a first-rate cover letter, and approach the application with professionalism.You may have an advantage if you are allowed to apply for the job before outsiders. However, you may not. Remember that others at your company could also be pursuing the same opportunity.
Be selective about applying for internal jobs. Management will take you less seriously if they know that you apply for anything and everything., Make sure that your direct supervisor and HR know about your application. You should avoid giving insult at all costs. If you have an understanding boss, for example, you could hurt her and lose a powerful advocate by not being upfront. She might be able to put in a good word for you.If, on the other hand, your boss is easily offended, try to be as diplomatic as possible with her about your desire to transfer. Make it clear that the issue is not personal â e.g., âYouâre a great supervisor and Iâve really enjoyed working for you. Itâs only that I want to expand my career opportunities.â She will find out eventually and it is better that she hear it from you.


If you donât feel comfortable going to your supervisor or your supervisor is the reason that you want to transfer, seek advice from your HR representative. You will still have to face your supervisor, but HR can guide you through it., Most likely you will have to go through a formal interview before you can transfer to a new position. Act as if you are an entirely new applicant during this process. Do not assume you have an edge, even if you might. Keeping this mindset will force you to stay as professional as possible for the duration and give you the best possible chance to get the job. As in preparing your application, the biggest mistake you can make is to be under-prepared, thinking that you have an inside track. To hiring managers this seems unprofessional and arrogant.As the Harvard Business Review points out, there are many things that can negate your potential advantage as an insider. The hiring manager will be influenced by his past. He might have had a bad experience with a previous inside hire, for example, and treat you with extra scrutiny. You should not ârest on your laurels.âAt a small company the interview process may be less formal. Do not take this to mean âless professionalâ! If anything, the fact that you probably know your interviewer makes professionalism all the more important. You should still research and prepare and be dressed appropriately, perhaps in a smart business-casual style., When you interview for a transfer position, treat it just as formally as if you were interviewing for a new company. Dress appropriately, meaning, in general, a clean blue or black business suit for men and women â and make sure that it is crisp and wrinkle-free. Bring a copy of your resume, arrive early, and greet your interviewer with a firm handshake and smile.Ask thoughtful questions, showing your preparation and knowledge of the position. Do not slouch and maintain friendly eye contact. Finally, thank the interviewer, ask about the next steps, and follow up within a few days with a formal, written thank you note., Continue to work hard at your position until you are able to transfer. Since you want to stay with the company, you should do your best to maintain a good working relationship with your current supervisor and/or team while signalling to your potential or new supervisor and/or team that you are serious about the job. Do not slack off. Continue to arrive on time, complete your duties thoroughly, and follow the rules as set forth in the companyâs formal policies. If your interview fails, you could otherwise risk your employment or a chance to transfer in the future., Congratulations! Youâve been hired and are transferring to a new department. Before you go, however, make sure to ease the transition for your old manager, co-workers, and replacement. Departures, especially abrupt ones, can throw whole departments into chaos, and the last thing that a new employee wants is take over someoneâs mess. As said, continue to do your job to the best of your ability until the final day. Finish any projects or other tasks before you leave, if at all possible. By doing so you will show your dedication, help your outgoing manager and co-workers, and let your replacement start fresh without having to clean up after you. By not tying up loose ends, you can burn bridges with old colleagues. To them, this sort of behavior says, âI really only think about myself and my personal advancement.â, Before you leave, it is a great help and mercy to show your replacement the tricks of the trade. You are uniquely qualified to show them not only what is written in the job description but how things are actually done â e.g., âDespite what youâve been told, you really have to write two monthly reports. One to the supervisor and one directly to sales.â This knowledge will help them pick up where you left off. Make a list of all of your duties, for example, with a sample daily and weekly schedule. Also consider putting together a âcontinuity folderâ with step-by-step instructions for the jobâs major tasks, including sample letters, reports, logbooks, and other models. You can even arrange to shadow your replacement for several days. Training your successor will allow you to leave gracefully, and is an experience that will enhance your resume.


As a final gesture, make yourself available in case problems arise. Give your replacement your email address or internal telephone number, saying, âPlease get in touch if you have any questions.â Even if she chooses not to reach out, you will leave with a final good impression.

Look for a lack of perks.,
Determine if your company is about to be acquired.,
Look for a loss of resources.,
Identify if your job is irrelevant.,
Locate classifieds that match your job description.,
Determine if youâre under special scrutiny.",How to Tell if You Might Get Fired1," The number of perks you get at work is an important measure of your overall approval rating by management. If you began your job with fully reimbursed travel expenses and paid lunch breaks, but now receive none of these, your job might be at risk., If your company was recently acquired and/or merging with another, you might lose your job. Staff positions â that is, non-specialist positions that the acquiring company already has covered within their own workforce â are especially at risk.Since the acquiring company does not know or value you, you should update your resume.There are several ways to determine if your company is about to be acquired or merge with another. If you work for an honest employer, you might get advance notice from them about the goings-on at higher levels.
But if your company is less honest, you might find out about the acquisition through reading the news or through word of mouth. Pay attention to business news and cultivate healthy relationships with your coworkers to increase your odds of knowing in advance whether the company will be involved in a merger or acquisition.

, One sign that you should look for a new job soon is that materials, services, or office space that were previously allocated to you are now going elsewhere.For instance, if your office has been commandeered by someone else in your department or another department, it might be part of a conscious effort to make your workplace unpleasant for you.You might also lose access to funding, client lists, or databases.

, If your job is getting absorbed by another department or is no longer necessary for the company you work for to function, you should update your resume. This can happen over a long period of time or over a relatively short period of time. If youâve been seeing â or begin to see â others in your department getting dismissed due to ârestructuringâ or âworkforce reductions,â you could be next.For instance, if you work in the cup-making department of a tableware manufacturer and the company decides that it no longer wants to produce cups, you should update your resume.

, If you see your company post an ad online seeking someone to do your job, or a job that has identical or nearly identical responsibilities, they could be looking for your replacement. Brush off your resume and prepare to find a new job.Browse the classifieds regularly and search for your job, or browse the âOpen Positionsâ section of your companyâs website.

, If youâve been asked to provide detailed time and expense reports but your coworkers have not, you should update your resume. If youâre asked to make special reports or called to account for some sort of budgeting issue, for instance, you should look for a new job. Ask your coworkers if theyâve also been forced to fill out the same reports and are under a similar level of scrutiny.Other signs that youâre under increased scrutiny include being forced to answer to new (or more) members of the management team.

Determine if youâre being overworked.If you began your job with a reasonable amount of work and you were able to accomplish it competently, but now find yourself buried under a mountain of projects that you havenât been properly trained or equipped to handle, your superiors may be setting you up to fail.Itâs possible, however, that your superiors misjudged your capabilities and you can simply talk to them about reducing your workload.Consult with one of your superiors about the situation.,
Determine if youâre being under worked.At the other end of the spectrum from being overworked, you might find that your workload is drying up.,
Receive a request to take time off or get a pay cut.",How to Tell if You Might Get Fired2," Say, âI feel overwhelmed by the amount of work coming in these days. Is there any way to transfer some of my projects to another department?â
If, despite your protests, youâre told that the workload youâve been assigned is your responsibility alone, and failure to accomplish everything will lead to consequences, you should look for a new job.

, If you began your job with an adequate amount of work but now find that youâre heading home early, have few responsibilities, and your paycheck is shrinking due to your lack of work opportunities, management might be forcing you out by withholding work.Consult with one of your superiors about the situation. Say, âI feel that I could take on some more work these days. Do you have anything for me?â
If the superior insists that youâre being given all the available work but in fact, your coworkers are getting plenty of new opportunities, just make the best of it. For instance, say to yourself, âI really enjoy having all this free time to watch short films and visit local museums.â

, If your superiors have asked you to accept less pay for the same work youâve been doing or to take a leave of absence, it could be an informal way to force you to find another job. For instance, you might be asked to accept $10 per hour for the same job that youâve been earning $15 per hour at.Your superiors may say, âThis is best for youâ or âWe think you just need a break.â
If youâve been asked to take an indefinite leave of absence, a layoff might be coming soon. To make the best of it, you should walk around the office and enjoy the time you have with your coworkers before your leave of absence begins. Look forward to your leave of absence as a period of time to look for a new job or catch up on hobbies.

Monitor the quality of the relationship you have with your boss.If your relationship with your boss declines in quality and remains poor for a significant length of time, you should get excited about the possibility that you might soon have a new job.,
Attempt to improve your relationship with your boss.,
Look for strange behavior from your coworkers.If your coworkers were previously friendly and kind to you, but now avoid your gaze and duck out of conversations with you quickly, they might know something you donât â that you need to brush up your resume.,
Evaluate how appreciated you are.,
Experience exclusion and isolation.If youâre being taken off important projects or meetings, or if you were never included in these meetings and projects to begin with, you might wonder why.,
Ask for a greater level of inclusion.",How to Tell if You Might Get Fired3," If your boss is less warm, open, and friendly toward you, and/or more hostile, dismissive, and tense toward you, you can consider your relationship with your boss to be quite poor.Donât delude yourself into thinking, âMy boss has just been tense and/or busy. Our relationship will recover soon.â This might be true in the short term, but if the state of your relationship with your boss continues to be negative over the course of several months, you might get fired soon., If you notice your relationship with your boss deteriorating, consult them directly in private conversation about your relationship. Ask, âIs everything okay between us? Is there something I can do to improve my performance?â If they say there are things you should do that you havenât been doing, take their suggestions seriously and implement them into your work routine.But if your boss says that everything between you is fine and nothing is wrong despite their cold, hostile, and/or disdainful behavior toward you, you should update your resume and reflect on the good times youâve had at your place of employment.

, In other cases, they might be gossiping about you and/or spreading rumors., If you donât get credit for your hard work, you might get fired. Bosses who appreciate you will say things like âGreat workâ or âThank you for all that you do.â Bosses who do not appreciate you will not say these kind things.Itâs an especially bad sign if your boss previously appreciated your work and now does not.

, Other odd experiences include evasive or noncommittal answers when you ask the management team why youâve been moved or kept away from key meetings, and a refusal to reinstate you (or install you for a first time) to the high-value projects and important meetings.You might also be left out of the loop and/or not receive emails about significant projects., If you find yourself being excluded or isolated by the management team at work, you should consult one or more of them to find out if there are things you can do to adjust the situation. For instance, you might consult a member of management and ask, âAre there things I can do to gain more access to meetings and important projects? Iâd like to contribute.âIf the manager in question gives you specific feedback about how they need your performance to improve or adjust in some way, take their suggestions seriously and incorporate them into your workflow.
The manager you speak to might know nothing about your situation and reply that they will look into it. In this case, you might end up with a greater level of inclusion in meetings and projects.
If the manager you speak to denies there is a problem or gives a weak reply, you should look for another job.

Attend to warnings.,
Get a poor performance review.Poor performance reviews are part of the paper trail that a manager must create in order to justify firing an employee.,
Determine if youâve damaged your company.Generally, businesses have low tolerance for mistakes that cause damage to their finances or reputation.,
Receive an ultimatum.",How to Tell if You Might Get Fired4," If your boss has warned you about your work output or other job-related behaviors, you might soon require new employment. For instance, your boss might say, âYou need to shape up or youâll be out of a jobâ or âYour coworkers are reporting problems. Get your act together,â you can be pretty sure that your career outlook is poor. Warnings might also be written. For example, you might receive a memo or email that reads, âThis is a warning that if things continue as they presently are, you will be fired.â


If you receive a warning, take the action that your boss recommends in order to avoid being fired. If your boss does not recommend a particular course of action, ask them directly, âWhat can I do to correct the behavior youâve warned me about?â

, If youâve had a poor performance review, management can use it to fire you. The likelihood of being fired increases with the number of poor consecutive performance reviews you receive.You might be able to correct your performance after a poor performance review. If management gives you pointers about how to life your performance levels after the first bad review, act on the advice to improve your performance during the next review.
Management may indicate that your performance is poor by saying things like:

âYouâre not a team player.â
âYou have a poor attitude.â
âWe do not have space for someone with your personality.â



, For instance, if your boss says, âYouâve really embarrassed the companyâ or âYour mistakes cost us big time,â youâll likely be given the boot soon.If you cost the company financially, you might be able to help your company see the positives of the situation in order to avoid being fired. For instance, if your prototype rocket engine blew up on the launchpad but the research that went into it led to multiple new patents, you might be able to point to these financial gains to balance the loss of the actual prototype.

, If you have too many bad performance reviews â or even a private meeting with your boss â and you hear that âYouâre not a good fit for this companyâ or âYour performance is consistently not meeting company standards,â you are probably being fired. Typically, there is no way to avoid losing your job in this situation.However, you could ask your boss if there is a way to correct the problem they see. Ask your boss, for instance, âIs there anything I can do to better meet company standards?â
They will probably say there is nothing to be done, but they might offer some pointers and put you on a probation period. In this case, take seriously the advice theyâve offered and work to incorporate it into the way you do your job.

Consider any settlement offers.",How to Take Legal Action if Fired for Having PTSD," Finding an attorney â let alone several possibilities â can be difficult if you have no idea where to start. Nonprofit organizations dedicating to assisting people with disabilities may be the best place to get strong recommendations.Your state or local bar association also will have a searchable directory you can use to find attorneys near you who practice employment law and represent employees who've suffered discrimination.
The benefit of a bar association directory is that you already know the attorneys listed are licensed in good standing. However, you still should check to make sure attorneys haven't been the subject of discipline.
Restrict your search to employment law attorneys who specialize or have extensive experience representing employees who have been wrongfully discharged because of a disability.;
, Ideally, you'll want to start with a list of a dozen or so employment law attorneys who specialize in representing employees who have been wrongfully terminated because of their disabilities.Go to the website for each attorney or law firm to learn more about each attorney's background and experience.
Often you can find an attorney profile that will give you details about the attorney's educational background, as well as personal information about their interests, hobbies, and family.
Use the information you find to identify attorneys with whom you relate. Then do a general internet search for their name to find out more about their reputation.
Typically you'll be able to find client reviews that will give you a good idea of what it's like to work with that attorney and how they represent and interact with their clients.
Evaluate these reviews critically, and keep in mind that anonymous reviews typically have less value. You have no way of knowing who the person is who wrote the review, so you can't evaluate their motivations.

, Employment law attorneys typically provide a free initial consultation, so it shouldn't drain your bank account to speak to several. Three or four initial consultations should provide you enough options to make the best possible choice.Make sure you leave enough time for each consultation. Even if the attorney only promises an hour for free, you should leave at least two or three hours per meeting.
You also want to try to schedule these consultations within a week or two. There are strict deadlines to file an administrative charge, and you don't want to end up starting too late.
If an attorney gives you forms to fill out or a list of information to provide before your initial consultation, make sure you get that material to them as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that the more information you can give an attorney before the initial consultation, the more valuable that consultation will be for you.

, Come prepared to each initial consultation with a detailed list of questions you want to ask covering a number of different areas. You should come away with a good understanding of each attorney's experience, strategies, and practice style.Find out how many clients similar to you each attorney has represented, and what happened in those cases.
Different disabilities come with different issues. Finding an attorney who has previously represented clients who were wrongfully terminated for having PTSD will best understand the difficulties you face.
You also want to learn as much as you can about the attorney's practice strategy. Some are settlement-oriented, while others want to fight it out in court.
Ask the attorneys how much of the work on your case they will complete on their own, and how much will be done by paralegals or less-experienced attorneys.
If an attorney indicates someone else in the office will be doing much of the work on your case, find out if you can meet that person too before you make up your mind.
Get a good understanding of each attorney's fee arrangements, so you have a general idea of how much it's going to cost you to fight your former employer.
Some attorneys may be willing to represent you on a contingency fee basis, which means they'll take a percentage of any settlement or award you receive.

, After your initial consultations are over, create a able you can use to compare the attorneys you met objectively to choose the one with the most experience and best practice style.Making this raw, objective determination can be fairly simple. However, the best attorney on paper may not necessarily be the best one for you.
Don't forget to take into account how the attorney makes you feel. You want an attorney on your side who you trust to fight for you, and who you believe respects you.
An attorney who you find intimidating or who treats you condescendingly may not be the best attorney for you.
Keep in mind that if you end up in court, your former employer will dig into your life and your background. If you're not comfortable with your attorney, revealing these traumatic details can be even more difficult.
You need an attorney with whom you feel comfortable enough that you would not hesitate to tell them anything â even if there's something in your background that you fear might damage your case.

, Once you've decided which attorney you want to hire, don't delay to let them know. You need to get your case started as soon as possible. Make sure you sign a written retainer agreement before you allow the attorney to work on your case.Your attorney should go over the retainer agreement with you and explain it thoroughly. If you have any questions, ask for clarification.
Pay particular attention to the fee arrangement. If there's anything with which you disagree, speak up. Despite appearances, retainer agreements are negotiable. You may be able to work out a better agreement if you ask.
You also may want to have a trusted friend or family member review the agreement before you sign.

, You have a limited period of time to file an administrative charge, which must be done before you can file a lawsuit. Your attorney will help you analyze state and federal law to determine how to proceed.PTSD is considered a disability under the ADA and most state laws. While the ADA protects you from wrongful termination, your state law may offer more protection, such as by making it easier to prove discrimination has occurred.
The ADA and other federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment are enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which has field offices all over the country.
If you are a veteran, you also may find additional protection under federal laws that prohibit discrimination against employees on the basis of their military status.
Your attorney will help you assess your eligibility for protection from these laws, which depends in part on the number of employees your employer has.

, The EEOC has a form you must complete to initiate a charge with the federal agencies. State agencies typically have similar forms. This form requires you to provide detailed information about yourself, your former employer, and the discrimination that has occurred.Your attorney may offer you assistance, but you should expect to fill out the questionnaire yourself.
Be as detailed as you possibly can when discussing your termination, including as many facts as you know.
Be sure to include the names of anyone involved in the decision to terminate you, and any reasons you were given for your termination. You also want to include the names of any managers or supervisors.

, Once you've completed your questionnaire, you must submit it along with any required supporting documentation to the local field office of the appropriate agency. Typically it's best to bring your paperwork to the office in person.Your attorney will help you locate the nearest field office if you're submitting a federal charge to the EEOC.
The agency recommends that you take your intake questionnaire to the office in person, as you typically will have the opportunity to speak to an agent right away.
On the other hand, if you submit your questionnaire by mailing it, the process of investigating your charge may be delayed by as much as 30 days.

, After you've filed a charge with the EEOC, an agent will investigate your claims and speak with you regarding the discrimination you've allegedly experienced. The agent also will seek a response from your former employer.Based on your questionnaire and the response from your former employer, the EEOC agent may have additional questions for you.
If you've already hired an attorney, be sure to let the agent know this. They will need to communicate with your attorney first before they speak to you directly.
If you've talked to any co-workers who are willing to speak to an agent on your behalf, you should provide the investigating agent with their names and contact information.

, In most cases, after the agent has completed their investigation they will recommend that you and your former employer enter mediation. Since the process is voluntary, both you and your former employer must first agree to take part.Before mediation, you'll typically sit down with your attorney and talk about what you want out of the situation.
Depending on the circumstances surrounding your termination, you may not be looking for any money â maybe you would be happy simply to have your job back.
However, typically you should ask for lost wages covering the time you were unemployed, as well as attorney's fees.
While you can have an attorney represent you during the mediation itself, this isn't required. However, keep in mind that your former employer typically will have at least one attorney on its side.
If you and your former employer are able to negotiate a settlement, the EEOC will approve it and write up an agreement for both of you to sign.

, The EEOC (or your state agency) will send you a right-to-sue letter if your issues cannot be resolved through administrative processes. Once you have the letter, you can continue your fight in the courts.Going through the entire administrative process to its conclusion can take several months, if not a year.
You can request a right-to-sue letter as soon as 60 days after you've submitted your charge, so you can file your lawsuit without having to wait that long.
In other words, it isn't necessary to complete the entire administrative process and reach no settlement with your former employer before you file a lawsuit.
The right-to-sue letter simply confirms to the court that you have availed yourself of administrative processes as required by the law.

, Your complaint is the court document that will initiate your lawsuit in either state or federal court. It sets the stage with a list of factual allegations against your employer that, if proven, constitute discrimination in violation of the law.If you're suing under federal law, your lawsuit will be filed in the federal district court that has jurisdiction over the area where your former employer is located.
A lawsuit based on state law would typically be filed in your county court. However, if you have claims under both federal and state law, you generally must file in federal court as state courts cannot hear federal claims.
When your lawsuit is filed, your attorney will give you a file-stamped copy of your complaint for your records. Make sure you keep it in a safe place together with all other documents related to your case.
Your attorney will have your former employer served with a copy of your complaint. This provides them with legal notice that you've filed a lawsuit against them.

, After being served with your complaint, your former employer has only a few weeks to file a written response to your complaint with the court. This response may consist of an answer as well as a motion to dismiss.If your former employer does not respond to your lawsuit in any way, you may be eligible to win your lawsuit by default â but you shouldn't expect this to happen.
Often your employer will file a written answer denying your allegations, and also file a motion to dismiss which alleges that you've failed to state a claim.
To overcome this motion, you and your attorney will have to appear in court for a hearing and demonstrate that there is a question of fact to be decided at trial.

, Once you've overcome any motion to dismiss, the ""pleadings"" stage of litigation is complete, and you move to the discovery phase. During discovery, you and your former employer exchange information.The court typically will set deadlines for various stages of the discovery process. Requests for production potentially could be one of your best sources of information.
Through requests for production, you can get copies of all personnel files related to your employment and eventual termination, including correspondence between managers or human resources staff of your former employer.
Your former employer probably will want to depose you. A deposition is a live interview in which your former employer's attorney asks you questions about your claims that you must answer under oath.
A court reporter is present and will produce a written transcript of the deposition for future reference.
Your attorney will give you advice on how to respond to deposition questions, but remember that your attorney cannot answer for you during the deposition itself.
Your attorney may object to a question during the deposition, but you still must answer the question. The objection is merely preserved for the record.

, At various points during pre-trial litigation, your former employer is likely to make multiple offers to settle. These offers will be communicated first to your attorney, who will discuss them with you.Keep in mind that while your attorney may give you advice on whether you should accept a settlement offer, the final decision ultimately is yours.
The offers you receive may increase or decrease depending on information revealed through the discovery process.
For example, if you give a particularly successful deposition that makes your case look stronger, you may get a more generous settlement offer immediately following the deposition than any you've gotten before.
If your former employer doesn't propose a settlement that you find satisfying, you'll work with your attorney to prepare for trial. Keep in mind that pre-trial litigation and trial preparation can take up to a year or more.

Attend mediation if required.,
Cooperate with the EEOC investigation.,
Wait for EEOC action.,
File a lawsuit in your nearest federal court.",How to Sue for Wrongful Termination1," If you believe your former employer fired you on the basis of your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information, you can file a charge of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.All of the laws enforced by the EEOC require you to file a charge with the agency before you will be allowed to file a lawsuit for discrimination.
To file a discrimination charge, you can simply walk-in to your nearest EEOC field office and fill out the form to file a charge. If you live too far away, you can call the EEOC toll-free number at 1-800-669-4000. A representative will take basic information about your case and forward it to the appropriate field office.;
, Either in person or over the phone, an agent in the appropriate field office will talk to you about your charge and ask you questions about your termination and the reasons you believe you were terminated for a discriminatory reason.


For example, suppose your boss needed to lay off a number of workers, and he decided to lay off the oldest workers first, keeping the younger ones. This could be evidence of age discrimination.You'll need to back up your charge with as much evidence as you can find, including eyewitness accounts or any notes or emails that contain discriminatory statements.
Within 10 days of receiving your charge, the EEOC will send a copy of it to your former employer and ask for a response to the charge.

, In some cases, the EEOC will require you and your former employer to attend a mediation and attempt to resolve the dispute without proceeding to a formal EEOC investigation.


The mediator will work with you and your former employer to attempt to reach a voluntary settlement of the dispute., If the EEOC found evidence to support your discrimination charge and you and your former employer were unable to reach a settlement during mediation, the EEOC may launch a full investigation of your case.


During the investigation, the EEOC will request documents and interview witnesses to get to the bottom of the facts and circumstances surrounding your case.
Depending on the amount of information to be analyzed and other factors, the EEOC investigation could take as long as six months., At the conclusion of the investigation, the EEOC will notify you of the action it is taking in your case. Regardless of the EEOC's decision, you always have the right to file a lawsuit.


If the agency finds no violation of the law, it will send you a notice that you have the right to sue for discrimination in federal court.
If the agency does find a violation of the law, it will attempt to reach a settlement with your former employer. If that isn't possible, the agency will either sue your former employer itself or send you a notice that you have the right to sue for discrimination in federal court yourself., When the EEOC has completed consideration of your discrimination charge, you have the right to sue your former employer in federal court.


Even if the discrimination does not violate one of the laws the EEOC enforces, you still might be able to recover damages for wrongful termination.
Before you file a lawsuit in federal court, consider hiring an attorney. Federal court procedure is complex and if you file on your own, you will be expected to know all the rules to the same extent an attorney would. If you can't afford an attorney, check with your state bar association for free or reduced-cost legal services such as legal aid societies or law school clinics.

Read over your written contract.,
Determine if you have an implied contract.,
Consider sending your former employer an initial demand letter.,
Decide where you need to file your lawsuit.,
Draft your summons and complaint.,
File your complaint in the appropriate court.,
Serve your former employer.,
Consider mediation.,
Prepare for trial.",How to Sue for Wrongful Termination2," If you signed a written employment contract, it may include a clause outlining the circumstances under which you can be terminated.


If you were terminated for any reason other than those listed in your contract, or for no reason at all, you may have a breach of contract claim against your employer., Actions or statements on the part of your employer may create an implied contract in some situations, even if you never signed a written contract.


While a judge always will look at the totality of the circumstances, promotions, employee handbooks, and letters or emails assuring continued employment all may add up to an implied contract.Most employers will point out in any written policy, application, handbook, or other employment-related document given to you that you are an at-will employee. If you are employed at will, you may be fired at any time for any reason or no reason â with the exception of some illegal reasons. If your documents contain explicit statements that you are an at-will employee, they cannot reasonably be interpreted as creating an implied contract.Similar to the implied contract, some courts have determined that an employer wrongfully terminated an employee by violating an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing â essentially, that the employer cheated the employee by firing her. For example, an employer may fire a sales employee to avoid paying her sales commissions she earned. In such a case, a judge typically would find that the employee had been wrongfully terminated and require the employer to pay her those commissions.You might consider consulting with an attorney about your case, especially if you are basing it on an implied contract. This area of law can get complicated, and if you file your lawsuit on your own you'll still be expected to understand it just as much as an attorney would.

, If you have what you believe is an open-and-shut case that your employer breached your contract by firing you, send your employer a letter outlining your claim and offering to settle the matter without going to court.


Don't be rude or threatening, but be assertive in your claim. Give your employer a deadline to respond, and explain that you are prepared to file suit if he doesn't agree to your demands., If you decide to file a lawsuit, you must figure out which court has jurisdiction over your claim.


Usually you would file your contract-based lawsuit in the county where the contract was supposed to be completed.For example, if you live in one county but worked in the neighboring county, you would want to file your lawsuit in the county where you worked, not the county where you live.
Also keep in mind that different courts deal with different types of cases. For example, some courts only hear cases involving family law, or only hear juvenile proceedings. In larger counties, the civil courts may be divided based on the amount of money you want or what other remedies you're requesting., The complaint tells the judge about your former employer's breach of contract, describing how this injured you, and asking to be compensated financially for that injury.The summons tells your former employer that you're filing a lawsuit against him and he needs to show up in court and respond.Each court has its own format for civil court complaints. You may be able to find a form online or by contacting the clerk of court's office. If your county doesn't have a form, the clerk may be able to provide you with complaints filed in other cases that you can use as examples or guides.
Find out from the clerk if you need any other documents, such as a certificate of service or a notice of hearing, to accompany your complaint. Those forms should be available at the clerk's office or online as well.

, Typically, you must bring several copies of your complaint and summons. The clerk will file the original and may schedule a date for your first hearing in the case.


You will have to pay a filing fee to initiate your lawsuit. If you don't believe you can afford the fee, the clerk will have an application for a fee waiver that you can fill out. If your application is approved you won't have to pay court fees., After you've filed your lawsuit, it must be formally served on your former employer so he has notice that he's being sued.


You cannot serve the papers yourself. You must get someone else to do it. That person must be someone over the age of 18 who isn't part of your case.
You can also use certified mail for service. Sending something certified means you will get a signed receipt back when your former employer receives the papers.When service is completed, you'll have to fill out a proof of service form and file it with the court. This form tells the court that you served your lawsuit on the other party., Depending on how contentious relations are with your former employer, you may find it easier and less expensive to use a private mediation service than to go through with a formal trial.


Mediation uses a neutral, uninvolved third party to work with you and your former employer to resolve the dispute together.
Because mediation proceedings are less formal than trial, and because the outcome of a mediation can remain confidential, it may provide a more comfortable setting for both you and your former employer., During the pre-trial discovery phase, you will collect facts and statements about your case and share information and evidence with your former employer.


You may interview witnesses or request copies of documents from your former employer that are relevant to your case, such as personnel records.Because conducting discovery requires an understanding of the court's rules of procedure and rules of evidence, you should consider having an attorney assist you with the process."

Prepare for trial.",How to Sue for Wrongful Termination3," A violation of public policy is based on a specific statute or regulation, or on your state constitution.


For example, you cannot be fired for exercising a legal right such as taking time off work to vote or serve on a jury.Consider consulting an attorney. Claiming your former employer violated public policy when she fired you entails making legal analysis. Although you can review the law on your own, you won't understand it the way an attorney would. Even if you can't afford to have an attorney represent you for the entire case, you may be able to talk to someone about your initial complaint.

, Before you start drafting your lawsuit, pull together all the documents or witnesses you have that will support your claim that your former employer violated public policy when she fired you.


For example, if your boss sent you an email that said ""You should have participated in early voting. If you leave work on election day to vote, don't bother coming back,"" that might support your claim that she fired you because you took time off to vote.

, Wrongful termination lawsuits based on public policy are rather complex, and can cost a lot of time and effort. Send your former employer a letter describing your findings and conclusion and offer to settle the matter out of court.


You don't want to threaten your former employer, but you do want to remind her that court cases like this can be costly, and may cause her damaging negative publicity.
Come up with a reasonable demand and offer to compromise. Give your former employer a deadline to respond to your letter before you file a formal lawsuit., If the basis of your public policy suit is discrimination or retaliation, for example, you may be required to first file a complaint with a state or federal agency and exhaust that administrative process before you file a lawsuit in court.

, Check with the clerk of the court where you plan to file your lawsuit for forms or samples that you can use as a guide to draft your lawsuit.


Each court has its own rules regarding other forms that must be included with your summons and complaint to initiate a lawsuit, such as a notice of hearing or a cover sheet. Make sure you have forms or examples of each of these documents.
Once you've completed and signed your complaint, you'll need to make at least three copies of all the documents you intend to file with the court.

, Take your original documents and your copies to the clerk's office and file them to initiate your lawsuit.


The clerk will stamp all your documents ""filed"" with the date. Depending on the court, he may also schedule a court date for an initial hearing or other court appearance.
You will have to pay a filing fee to have your lawsuit filed. If you don't think you can afford to pay the fee, you can fill out an application for a fee waiver in the clerk's office. If your application is approved, you won't have to pay any fees., After you've filed your lawsuit, you must serve your former employer so she knows you are suing her and when and where she needs to show up in court.


You complete service by getting someone over the age of 18 who isn't involved in the case to give the complaint and summons to your former employer.
You also can serve your employer by sending the documents using certified mail.After your former employer is served, you'll have to complete a proof of service form that tells the court you served your lawsuit., You can use a neutral, third-party mediator to help resolve your dispute more quickly and inexpensively than going to trial.


Mediations tend to be less formal than a trial, so you don't have to worry about knowing all the rules of evidence and procedure, as you would if you went to trial.
Because mediation is confidential, the process allows you and your former employer to resolve the case without a public record, which your former employer might prefer., Before trial, you will exchange information and evidence with your former employer during the discovery process.


You may send questions to your former employer that she must answer under oath, or you may request documents such as your personnel file that are relevant to your case.
Participating in the discovery process requires extensive knowledge of the court's rules of evidence and procedure, so you should consider consulting an attorney to help guide you through it."

Get creative.",How to Survive Unemployment," Being unemployed is your reality for now. You're part of a rather large percentage of the workforce competing to survive, which means that there is a need to be careful and strategic about how you react to the situation.


Brooding over the rights and wrongs of how you ended up unemployed is part of letting out your frustration. However, if you get stuck on this broken record and spend all of your time living the injustice of it, you'll likely get stuck in a rut, sound permanently wrecked and scare off your spouse, kids, neighbors and future bosses. Remind yourself that it happened, you've suffered but now it's time to recoup.
Do not snipe at your previous employer. Keep the online insults inside your head and never let them flow through your tapping fingers. You never know when your old boss or coworkers will be needed for a good reference.;
, It is reasonable to expect cynicism and frustration about the job system. What is happening with employment worldwide is complicated and much of it isn't fair. However, it is important to realize that working with an unfair system is what you have to do rather than decrying it daily and using this as an excuse to give in. People who really understand how difficult is to be unemployed bring a much needed outlook to the workplace when they return; such people tend to be more compassionate, more humble and more ready to work hard. Focus on the fact that this is a ""time out"" filled with learning opportunities that will set you in good stead.

, If you don't know already, find out from your former employer or welfare agency if you can collect right away. In some cases you may need to wait until any severance, bonus or other monies paid are exhausted first. Once you've received the answer, do what makes most sense to you and your circumstances, with regard to collecting immediately or waiting.


In some countries you are able to claim a form of financial support while you job seek; however, if you have made yourself voluntarily unemployed then there will usually be a minimum period that has to elapse before you can begin claiming this.

, You can often get charitable help in the way of food banks, clothing assistance, job application reskilling, etc. through charities that focus on helping unemployed people. If you feel too proud to seek such help, remind yourself that you are part of what keeps some of those charity workers in a job, as their services are only needed when people use them. Moreover, sometimes being part of the charity community is a way of finding new work, especially if you undertake volunteer work when you feel ready.

, In some cases, changes can be made within your immediate family that will give you the breathing space needed to recover from the past job and look for a new one. In other cases, extended family may be able to assist with loan/mortgage repayments or other forms of help. Think about all the possibilities open to you through a supportive family structure; for example, if a family member owns residential property, you might be able to do a deal to downsize to it and pay cheaper rent for a while.

, This is especially important where your job loss has been traumatic (most cases, but not always), as you'll need to find time to reflect on what has happened and pull yourself together again. How long this will take varies from person to person and it's not something that can be rushed.


If you like sleeping in, let yourself do this for a short time. This can count as part of your ""regeneration"" time. However, be wary of allowing it to turn into a habit, and be even more alert if you find you simply cannot get out of bed in the mornings, as this may be a warning that you're suffering from depression and need medical help.

, After you've taken some pampering time to recover from the loss, choose a new routine and stick to it. Routine gives a sense of purpose to life and focuses on the things that make your life run more smoothly. The routine should set aside time both for you alone and for you to spend with family and friends.


Get up at the same time each morning. After you've recovered, avoid sleeping in regularly (weekends are okay). Getting up at the same time each day is not only a routine helper but it's also a way of helping you to maintain regular, healthful sleep. The body responds to regular sleep times and this can help prevent insomnia, poor sleep or oversleeping issues.
Treat each day as a day that matters and honor its arrival by planning to make the most of it. This can be very hard initially but try to see the bigger picture; the sun still rises and sets, the world still turns. Your part in all of it has changed dramatically but being a part of the living world is still very much your reality.

, When you feel ready (or as soon as you feel pressured to get on with it), treat the job search like a job in its own right. This may feel weird at first but the routine will grow on you and it tends to be the only way to churn out the job applications in an effective way.


Set up a workspace that is entirely devoted to job applications. It's great if it's somewhere that you can shut the door and get away from everything for a few hours a day but even if you can't, carve out a special, quiet corner. If the house is too noisy, plan to visit the library or another quiet space at the set hours each day.
Shut the door on or throw a sheet over your workspace when your set job search time is over. By stopping the search at a set time, you allow yourself to participate in all the other activities that leave you feeling whole and normal, such as cooking, exercising, cleaning, entertainment, catching up with friends, etc. If you allow job search time to bleed into all of the day, you're likely to be less effective and a lot more annoyed about the way that it dominates your life.

, Initially it probably feels mind-boggling but you need to quickly assess the best places to find job advertisements and connections so that those become your main focus. Things to keep in mind include:


Find and bookmark all relevant job websites and feeds. As much as possible, narrow these down to your skills, experience and qualifications. However, also think laterally and toss in other job streams that might prove fruitful with a little tweaking of your skill set.
Get involved in sites like LinkedIn and find all the people who might prove to be useful leads. Network online, follow relevant feeds, participate in discussions and try to find people who are looking for people. Most of the jobs are not even properly advertised but are word-of-mouth or quietly announced. Some jobs don't even exist until you push hard enough with the right person.
Amend your personal websites. Change them to reflect that you are looking for employment such as amending your LinkedIn profile otherwise you might miss out on potential opportunities, as contacts don't know you are looking.
Keep good records of your job searches. That way, you'll know who you've applied to and when, what the outcome was, how many retries you've made, etc.

, Find out what is current (your existing one may be so out of date both in content and style that it's doing you a disservice). Some unemployment agencies and charities provide free resume building classes or workshops. You can also borrow books from the library on improving them. In some cases, spending a bit of your savings on refining a resume through a professional service may be worth the expense.


Ask family members and friends to read your resume and provide suggestions.
Be ready for this very challenging reality: Your resume needs to speak to the job applied for. Unfortunately, in this day and age, one-size no longer fits all. Be prepared to constantly tweak the resume to make it pop out among all others for every single job you apply for (this is why you need to set aside several hours a day to treat applying just like it's a job).
Learn how to write a good cover letter. There are resources online, in books and through video seminars that can help you learn this. Once you've learned, you don't have to keep relearning and each letter will become easier to write.

, Maintaining a diary of your unemployment can be of great value later on in your search. There is also the fact that your relevant unemployment agency can call upon you at any time during your collection of benefits, and this enables you to provide them with a snapshot of companies you've approached and each position you've sought. On this log, keep record of jobs that you should follow up.

, This is particularly important if submitting details to employment agencies. They receive numerous applications and it is easy for your details to go astray or get overlooked. Even you do not get put forward for a position it is worth finding out the reasons why so you can adapt your style and content for your next submission - No application is a waste of time!

, Go back to school. This isn't for everyoneââthere are plenty of people who shake at the knees at the thought of more exams and incurring yet more debt. However, if this is the pathway to getting you to the next stage in your life, it can be a great option.


Does it need to be a certificate, diploma, associate degree/degree or a postgraduate qualification? Or, can you do a series of simple certified courses? Maybe volunteering and practical work will get you to where you wish to be. Look wide and far before settling on your course of studying/relearning.

, Keep yourself occupied with something else while searching for a job and learn new skills in the process. If you discover you really enjoy it, find out what you need to do to switch into this area and what sorts of opportunities exist within the organization you're volunteering for.

, Feeling like tossing the whole job thing in and turning entrepreneur instead? This is risky, hard work but for the right person with the right attitude and determination, it may be an ideal solution to permanently remove yourself from the job cycle. Become the person who creates jobs rather than the one chasing them. To get to this stage, consider the following:


Deeply analyze your suitability to run your own business. Have you got what it takes? There are tests you can do and good books you can read on the topic.
What sort of business do you want to do? Research heavily hereââask such questions as: is it something people want?, is the field free or crowded already?, is it viable?, where can you get funds from?, and so forth. Read relevant business books to get ideas and to increase your understanding.
Talk to existing business people you know. Ask for their ideas and recommendations. They might even be able to give you a chance to volunteer and see what it's like.

, This is about as unstable an income stream as you can possibly wish upon yourself but it comes with great freedom if you get the balance right. What are you really good at? What niche can you provide in an expert and desirable way? Read books and research deeply before choosing to be a freelancer. Also check with your family that they'll be supportive of this choice.


Look online to see what possible opportunities exist for your freelance endeavors.
Be positive; it's hard to work freelance but some people are monumentally successful at it. Read about their experiences if you can and be inspired by them. But equally, know that if you have a skill that's in demand, you can make a go of freelancing.

, There will be days when you feel like giving up and there will be days where you almost get something only to be let down hours later by the call not coming in, the job offer being withdrawn due to circumstances beyond your control and yet another rejection email landing in your in-box. It happens a lot and will keep happening. When you feel especially bad, take the day off. Just like you would at work if it all got on top of you. Go and do something completely unrelated, give your head a break and start over again tomorrow. It'll all still be there waiting for you.

, Persevere, keep applying, keep ringing, keep visiting, keep emailing. You can wear people down, you can impress people with your temerity and certainty, you can hit the sweet spot when you least expect it. But you'll only manage these wonderful moments by participating and being ready to take up the opportunities, however uncommon or tenuous they may seem. It may seem pointless and endless at times but with each application, you open up a new possibility and you continuously improve your skills at getting through to people.

, You may be unemployed but you still matter. You're a professional job-seeker. But you may also be a mom/dad/aunt/uncle/grandparent, a skilled sportsperson, a keen hobbyist, a lover extraordinaire, a beer connoisseur, a volunteer carer, an author-in-hiding, a community member, a frugal cook, and so forth. You are the sum of many parts and your unemployment does not define you. It may feel as if it's confining you but it isn't determining your worth. Stay committed to striving to be the best you can be.

, You have the space and time to think of what you really want from life. Treat this time out of work as a wake-up call, an opportunity to reassess the direction in which you're headed. Was that last job even what you wanted to do in life? Even if it was, had you reached the heights you'd hope to have by now? What are the things that really matter to you in your future? Map them out now and treat this as a reawakening, a time to realign your future progress.

, Focus on thinking positively, not comparing. Perhaps this is a time to take up yoga, meditation, therapy, talking more with friends and family, reading self-help manuals, correcting your poor posture. Whatever it is, use this time to get onto things you'd like done better in your life.

, Go to a country where your money goes further. You might even try to get a job in this new place, like teaching English or juggling on the street. Consider volunteer work as another overseas opportunity that can lead to amazing new things.


Travelling might also help you work out what you want to do with your life.
Look into couch surfing as a cheap accommodation option.
Consider taking a TEFL course.

, Think of all those creative things you haven't had time for before. Keep yourself occupied with a creative project such as art, learning an instrument, writing a book, making a film. Who knows where this artistic expression might lead next? Build time for it into your routine.

Schedule time for self-care activities like reading, working out, or hobbies.
Make sure you schedule daily activities that take you out of your home.

, Getting a job is important, but it is not a helpful goal for building self-esteem because it depends on people other than yourself. Instead, set goals like editing your c.v., reading 3 books a month, or working out 3 days a week. Achieving goals regularly will help to boost your self-esteem., When unemployed, many people begin to cut out activities not related to finding a new job because they are worried about money, feel guilty about having fun when they should be getting a job, or are simply embarrassed about being unemployed and donât want to go out.

Spend time with your family.,
Get more involved with your religion.,
Pursue your passions.,
Join a sports team.,
Spend time in the garden.",How to Retain Self Esteem During Unemployment2," High self-esteem typically occurs when an aspect of oneself â like oneâs job â is both considered highly important and positive. If you lose your job, the importance may remain, but the positive turns to a negative, harming self-esteem. Psychologists believe that the best way to restore self-esteem is to focus on other positive aspects of oneself. In other words, elevate the importance of the positive areas of your life, such asYour relationship with your spouse
Family

Intrinsic factors: intelligence; appearance

, Volunteering not only keeps you active and provides fulfilling work, it also gives you another positive identity around which to build self-esteem. And the right volunteer activities can help you land a job. To get the most out of your volunteering:


Network â Volunteering is a great way to meet people with common interests and to grow a network that might help you get a job.Offer Your Skills Pro Bono â Whether you help balance the books, create a fundraising strategy, build an addition, or cater an event, putting your skills to work for a non-profit will keep them sharp and allow you to display your worth.

Offering your skills will give you a chance to help others, while also reconfirming your own skills and thus boosting your esteem., One of the silver linings of unemployment is that it gives you more time to spend with your family. Whether you are a mother or father, husband or wife, son or daughter, engaging with your family provides you with psychological support and shores up an important aspect of yourself that can help to compensate for the damage to your work identity.

, In countries where being religious is the norm, including the United States, religious believers tend to have much higher self-esteem.Religious communities both emphasize the value of the individual and provide a network of likeminded people that can help to overcome the isolation of being unemployed.

, One of the worst parts of being unemployed is the feeling that you have lost control of your life, a feeling that can be particularly intense if you are looking for and failing to find work. A hobby that you are passionate about gives you something that you can control. It is also something that you can improve at and see tangible progress. All of these things can help to boost your self-esteem.And in time, your hobby might even grow into a job., There are many studies that show participation in team sports improves self-esteem.A team gives you a social outlet, provides exercise, and gives you a chance to demonstrate your value to people engaged in a common pursuit.

Keep a list. Make a spreadsheet with the contact info of people you respect and would want to work with professionally in the future. Depth is more important than breadth. Save these spots for people who want to help you as much as you want to help them.Schedule follow-up. Put entries in your calendar reminding you to follow up with contacts every two or three months. Ask them how they are doing, and if you can help out in any way.Stay in touch in other ways. Pass along blogs or news stories you think your contacts would like. Connect to them on LinkedIn and keep track of their status. If they are promoted, congratulate them. If they are laid off, offer support. If you have a recreational activity in common, send them articles about it. Thank them if you take their advice and it helps."

Keep an eye out for decreased productivity.,
Monitor your employee's need for sick days: When âfakeâ coughs become more frequent, this should be a red flag for an employer.,
Watch how your employee dresses.,
Be aware of increased internet usage According to a study of Internet usage at work by Burst!,
Listen for complaints about the job.,
Watch for the employee who is constantly checking his/her cell phone, or going outside the building to make or answer calls.",How to Tell if an Employee Is Looking for a New Job," Work assignments not being completed in a timely fashion, unreturned voicemails or emails, and lack of initiative to take on new projects could be indications an employee is no longer committed to the job.;
, While employers can not deny sick days or ask employees to report to work, they should be aware if patterns are forming. An employee could be using sick time to interview. Eric Neely, a hiring manager, has had his share of turnover in his career, âI once had an employee call in sick three days in a row with a bad case of the stomach flu. On the fourth day he resigned via phone. He had accepted a position with another company. Needless to say, the entire office felt a little sick from his actions.â

, If business casual attire becomes strictly business attire, you may be looking at a person going to an interview. When asked why he or she is dressed up, the reply is something like: âDidnât get around to laundry this week.â A typical interview last between 45 minutes to an hour. If the suspicious employee combines the Navy suit with a long lunch or doctorâs appointment there is a 90% chance he is looking for another job.

, Media, 32.3% of men between the ages of 25 and 34 said they spend three or more hours a day on the Internet at work. If every time you walk by an employeeâs cube they either quickly block the computer screen with their body or minimize the page they were viewing, there is a good chance they want to avoid you seeing the monster.com homepage.

, This is a no-brainer. If an employee constantly complains about co-workers, their job responsibilities, and having to come to work Monday-Friday, there is a good chance they do not see themselves with the company for a long time.

, This doesn't necessarily indicate they are job-searching, but could be a strong possibility.

Listen to what your employer has to say. It may be tough to keep quiet but in order to understand the situation, you must listen.
Do not argue. No matter the circumstances, the decision has been made by your employer. As a courtesy to you they are giving you an option to either resign or stay and wait to be fired. Arguments and pleas will not change their minds.
Do not cause a scene up until you leave for good. The meeting can go very differently if you act out and the employer rescinds your option to resign. If you pose any threat or you are unprofessional, you will be asked to leave and escorted out the building by security. If this happens there will be negative implications such as bad references, bad impressions, possible ineligibility for unemployment or company benefits and possible legal issues.;
, Most likely you already understand the circumstances surrounding your choice to resign because you have been spoken to already, have a feeling something is going on or know you have done something undesirable. However, if you do not fully understand, you must ask questions. Knowing the exact reasons for asking you to resign will help you make your decision about whether to stay or wait to be fired.


For example, if you are being asked to leave because your position is being eliminated, then resigning will leave you without unemployment benefits and it may be best to wait to be fired. If you are asked to leave because you have engaged in prohibited acts defined by the company, it may be best to resign because of possible negative implications and ineligibility for unemployment.

, Before making your decision to resign or wait to be fired, it is important to know what the company policy is for employment verification and reference checks. This means knowing the type of information that is allowed to be released when a potential future employer calls the company for information. Information that may be released includes:


Dates of employment.
Title.
Salary.
Eligibility for rehire.
If left on good terms or not.
Reason for leaving.
Character and personal traits.
Work ethic.

, At this point you only have two options, resign or wait to be fired. You do not need to sign any paperwork or write a resignation letter immediately because you have the right to think over your options. There are pros and cons to both resigning and waiting to be fired and it is important to weigh your options before agreeing to something.


Your employer may try to bully you but they cannot force you to make a decision immediately. Either way you are leaving the company very soon but you must do what is best for your situation and your future.

Evaluate the pros and cons of resigning.,
Evaluate the pros and cons of waiting to be fired.,
Make a decision that is right for you and notify your employer.,
Prepare to move on.",How to Respond when You Are Asked to Resign2," As mentioned previously, there are pros and cons to each option that need to be taken into consideration before making a decision. The major con to resigning is that you most likely will not be eligible for unemployment benefits. Some pros to resigning include:


Being able to spin your reason for leaving positively. You do not need to say you were fired or asked to leave.
The reason given for termination by your employer will be âresignationâ.
You may be able to negotiate a severance package. The company wants you to leave and at this point you may have the upper hand in a way, even if you donât feel like thatâs the case. In exchange for you leaving peacefully, you may be able to negotiate a severance package to include a few months of pay and benefits.

, The pros to waiting to be fired can outweigh the cons if you need the unemployment benefits and feel you will be eligible given your circumstances. If you are fired for no reason of your own, you have a very good change to receive these benefits. Additionally, if you feel your termination is wrongful and/or discriminatory, you may be able to file a suit against this employer. On the other hand, the cons to waiting to be fired include:


You may not eligible for a severance package.
You may receive bad references if another company contacts this employer.
Your reason for termination will be stated as âfiredâ or âterminatedâ and possible reasons for termination can be disclosed (based on company policy as mentioned previously). For example, âThe employee was terminated due to gross misconductâ.

, Based on your evaluation of the pros and cons to both options, you must make a decision and express this to your employer as soon as possible. If you took some time out to make your decision, you will have to request another meeting to include all members in the original meeting. During the meeting:


Briefly explain whether you have decided to resign or stay.
Keep your explanation simple and professional.
Do not get overly emotional or angry.
Be prepared to leave that day. The employer may not take any chances and open themselves up to any risk by letting a possible disgruntled employee stay on the premises. If you have chosen to wait to be fired, be prepared to be fired that day.

, Be prepared to move on once you have made your decision and notified your employer. Since you will be leaving your position one way or another, it is now time for you to prepare yourself for your next career move.

If you don't have a new job lined up, be prepared to have enough savings to last at least six monthsâor some other financial resources to ease your period of unemployment. Make a plan of how you are going to budget your savings and any ways you might have to make money until you find another job.

If you can't wait, at least begin looking to see what jobs are out there and how competitive they are going to be.

, Think about why you want to resign and what the pros and cons are. Are there things you can do to eliminate or ameliorate the aspects of the job that bug you? If you are quitting because of money, can you ask for a raise? If you are quitting because of a troublesome coworker, can you ask to be transferred? Consider letting your superiors know how you feel, and give them a chance to improve the situation before you quit.

, Revisit any legal documents you signed when joining or working at your current jobs, from non-compete agreements to contracts requiring a certain period of employment from you. Breaking a contract can sometimes have troubling legal and financial consequences. Also check to see how much notice your company requires.
