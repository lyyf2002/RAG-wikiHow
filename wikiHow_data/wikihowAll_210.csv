Set a bucket of soapy water next to your car.,
Spray the sticker and the surrounding area with a tar removal substance.,
Lift one corner of the sticker using your fingernail.,
Slip your plastic spatula under the lifted corner of the sticker.,
Wipe the soapy wash rag across the entire area where the remaining section of the sticker or the residue of the sticker remains.,
Apply a small amount of the tar removal substance to whatever pieces of the sticker have not come off yet.",How to Remove Stickers From Your Car," Dip a wash rag into the soapy water, and wash over the sticker several times. Make sure to wash the area surrounding the sticker as well. This action will soften the sticker.;
, Be liberal with the application. This will help to break down the glue on the back of the sticker. Wait 5 minutes or more before proceeding to the next step. This allows the tar removal substance to soak through the sticker.

, This step to lift the sticker is the first true attempt in how to remove stickers from your car.

, Slowly slip the plastic spatula further under the sticker until you have removed the largest portion of the sticker that you can. Use your other hand to guide the spatula carefully underneath the sticker. Remove as much of the sticker as possible.

, Do this thoroughly. Try again to wipe off what is left behind using the plastic spatula.

, Continue to scrub the area with your soapy rag until every last bit of the sticker is removed, leaving nothing on your motor vehicle.

Move the car to a level, flat surface.,
Place pieces of wood or large rocks in front and in back of the tire that is diagonally across from the one being changed to keep the car from rolling.,
Remove hub cap - Use a flat screwdriver or the flat end of the lug wrench to remove the hubcap.,
Loosen wheel nuts - Now, fit one end of the lug-nut wrench on to the lug nut and turn it counterclockwise.,
Find your car's jacking point.,
Jack the car up until it is high enough to remove the old wheel and put the new wheel on.,
With the wheel in the air, remove the lug nuts and place them on a towel so they won't roll away.

,
Remove the wheel from the car.,
Match the holes of the new wheel with the stud bolts on the car and and set the wheel on the studs.

,
Start putting the lug nuts back on.,
Check each lug nut again for tightness.

,
Lower the car on the jack until the wheel begins to touch the ground.,
Lower the car the rest of the way.

,
Remove the jack and store it back in its proper location.

,
Replace the hubcap.",How to Switch the Wheels on a Car," If you aren't in a driveway or garage, turn on your hazard lights.;
, Make sure this wheel will not roll. If it's a rear wheel, set the parking brake. If it's a front wheel on a front wheel drive car, be sure the car is in park (automatic transmission) or in first gear (manual transmission). If the car is standard (manual transmission).

, Once it is removed, place the hubcap in your trunk so it doesn't get scratched up.

, Only loosen each nut about a quarter turn. Continue until you've loosened each lug nut.

, An older car may just use the frame, a newer car will have two notches or tabs on the seam below the door that the factory jack will fit into. Place the jack in place and raise the car slowly. Make sure the car doesn't try to roll away as the wheel comes off the ground.

, The new wheel may be bigger in diameter than the old flat wheel. You need enough room for the new tire to fit.

,, Make sure you have a firm grip so it doesn't roll away. Take the spare tire out of the trunk, and put the old tire in the trunk.

,, Make sure the rounded end of the nut goes towards the wheel or your wheel will be loose. The nuts should go most of the way in by hand. Take your lug wrench and tighten them as much as you can with the wheel in the air. You're going to tighten them again later, but you don't want the wheel moving around on the studs.

,, Tighten your lug nuts with your lug wrench (clockwise to tighten). They should be very tight. If you're a small to medium build person, I would say they should be as tight as you can get them. If you're a body builder, just don't break the studs.

,,, Be sure it is on securely and evenly. If you are not comfortable that the hubcap is secure, remove it and have someone help you at a later time.

Get some new shocks.The first and fastest way to beef up your suspension is just to upgrade your shocks.,
Be wary of getting too wild.,
Look for heavy duty shocks if necessary.",How to Upgrade Your Suspension1," This might be something as simple as buying the next-more-expensive OEM replacement, or by going so far as to add fancy high dollar upgrades that might well have the side effect of wrecking your driving experience, even as they add a little more of the desired stability and reliability.;
, Consulting with your local counterman is a good idea, but keep in mind that he is out to sell you product, and might not be as much of an expert as he thinks he is.


Any time you veer away from OEM equipment you are taking a gamble, and as a general rule, the industry translates 'improvement' and 'upgrade' as stiffer, less pliable shocks.
This can help you control a saggy rear end and might do a better job of keeping your tires on the ground where you need them, but doesn't translate to a smooth or comfortable ride.

, It is very difficult to predict how after-market shocks will affect your overall driving experience, despite the many claims made by marketing experts and salesmen.


That said, if you mean to be carrying heavy loads up to and including towing, it is probably a good idea to go for heavy duty shocks, even coil-over or air shocks, to keep your rear end from bottoming out.

Apply parking brake firmly.,
Using the ratchet, ratchet extension(s) and 15mm socket, remove the front skid plate and set it aside.,You may need to lower or raise the axle some to take pressure off of the lower link bolt, so that you can remove it easily at the appropriate step.,

Using the ratchet and 17mm socket, loosen, but do not remove, the upper link nut.,
Using the ratchet and 18mm socket, remove the lower through-bolt nut connecting the link to the axle.,



 Old Link & New Link Side by Side (through-bolt nut NOT in picture)

Remove the upper link nut and remove the link and old bushings from the stabilizer/sway bar.,



 Upper Link Assembly

To install the new links is pretty much a reversal of the removal process, but I suggest that you loosely secure the bolts and nuts at first to give them and the bushings a chance to ""seat"" properly before tightening to the final torque specs.,

Once all the nuts, bolts, and bushings are properly installed and seated, begin the final tightening sequence using the torque wrench.,Replace the wheels and lightly tighten the lug nuts.,
Re-install the front skid plate and tighten the bolts to approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) pounds.,Raise the vehicle slightly in order to remove the jack stands.,Carefully lower the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts to 100 foot (30.5 m) pounds.,After completing ANY repair on the vehicle suspension (and this is no exception), take the vehicle to a repair shop and have the alignment checked and/or adjusted by a properly trained professional.,Sit back and take pride in all of your hard work!",How to Replace the Front Stabilizer Bar Links on a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo," Place chocks or wood blocks behind rear wheels. Loosen the wheel lug nuts. Slowly raise the front of the vehicle by the axle and support it securely on jack stands. Remove the lug nuts and wheels and set them aside.
, Spray the bolts with the penetrating oil and allow them to ""soak"" if they are difficult to remove.,, Scrub with wire brush and spray with the oil if needed as mentioned above. The picture at right is of the old driver's side link in my Laredo prior to it's removal. As you can see, it was horribly rusted and the bolts hadn't moved for 16 years - I had to use a great deal of penetrating oil and my cheater pipe to get them to break loose., Use the breaker bar and torx bit to hold the bolt in place as you remove the nut. Scrub and spray with oil as needed. Use the hammer to tap the bolt free of the link and axle bracket. If the nut and bolt are in good shape (not stripped out, cracked, overly corroded, or showing other signs of metal fatigue) set aside for re-use during new link installation. If not, replace them with hardware of the same size and tensile strength as the original parts (additional tools may be required if an exact replacement cannot be found - ie larger or ""box-end"" type wrenches, different size and type sockets, etc...). I re-used the bolts on my Jeep because they were in pretty good shape after cleaning them up., This picture shows the old and new links prior to re-installation. The new link is about an inch shorter than the original and since I don't take my Jeep off-road, the shorter link provides a slightly stiffer ride. If you want to stay true to factory spec on your Jeep take careful measurements of the link shaft length and take them to your parts dealer when ordering your new links., When installing the bushings on the upper shaft of the link you will notice that they either have a small circular lip around the shaft opening or are slightly conical in shape on one face of the bushing. That lip or conical shaping needs to be against the sway bar (lip-side UP on the lower bushing, and lip-side DOWN for the upper bushing). Don't forget your concave washer-retainers. The order of installation is as follows:

Lower retainer washer (cupped side up)
Lower bushing (lip side UP)
Through the sway bar (not shown)
Upper bushing (lip side DOWN)
Upper retainer washer (cupped side down)
Upper nut

, Bear in mind that the bushings will be under extreme pressure after the nuts are tightened to their correct specifications and the bushings WILL NOT retain their original size.

Secure the upper link nuts to 27 foot (8.2 m) pounds (324 inch pounds)
Secure the lower axle through-bolt nut to 70 foot (21.3 m) pounds (840 inch pounds) in 10–20 foot (3.0–6.1 m) pound increments - alternating between sides at each stage.

Consider getting heavy duty shocks or struts.,
Think about getting ""ride adjusting"" shocks.,
Reinforce your springs.,
Insert air springs.,
Think about getting bigger wheels.",How to Upgrade Your Suspension2," Putting a big steel brush guard on your Jeep? Rigging up your truck to pull a trailer? Go for heavy duty shocks. No reason to get crazy just yet, but if you habitually haul a trunk of luggage or a bed full of boulders, or if you intend to haul a camper or boat or something, beefier shocks are your best first step.


When buying your upgrades be careful to check for compatibility, and unless you are also doing a lift job, steer clear of those models which call for a 2"" (or more) lift.
These might add to your clearance a little by themselves, but are actually intended to compensate for a lift job, not to provide one. You'll end up with less travel on your shocks, and likely ruin them pretty quickly.

, These shocks can go a long way towards keeping you from sagging and bottoming out while hauling things.


When doing such an upgrade, it's best to replace shocks at all four wheels with a more or less equivalent quality, though the 'ride adjusting' and air shocks are generally only for your rear wheels.
Air shocks are particularly interesting, as they can be stiffened up for heavier loads, or softened for smooth but stable ride.

, You might also consider reinforcing your springs when getting ready for heavy hauling. If your machine has leaf springs (common on trucks and many cars for rear suspension) you can simply have a leaf added, or 'spring helpers' that bolt on to your existing springs to add tension and strength, giving you as much as a ton (or more) of extra load-bearing capability.


Coil springs are more common on the front wheels, and can likewise be reinforced by fairly cheap, easily applied supports - generally a polyurethane brace that can be slipped into the spring coil, reducing the amount of play in the spring without adding any additional ride height.
Both of these spring helpers can actually increase your ride height by a small amount, though this does not count as a lift. Leaf spring and coil spring reinforcement simply reduces the amount your vehicle chassis weight compresses the springs, which may render a slightly lifted appearance.
Wheel travel is not generally affected, and if you did it just right, your additional weight will bring things back to about normal. By all means put in heavy duty shocks, but stick to the OEM fit.

, To really solidify your ride, airbag or air spring inserts can be added to coil spring suspensions, which are reputed to significantly reduce sag and bounce.


Some kits can be self-installed with basic tools, but they are generally not an inexpensive option anyway, and might be best left for professionals to install for you, as they generally require dropping axles and removing the springs.
While this is not the end of the world, it is potentially problematic and dangerous if you don't know what you are doing.

, The above improvements might be plenty if you need a little extra clearance for your oversized tires or larger diameter wheels with the low profile tires that have become fashionable.


If going for these options, keep in mind that low profile tires, while reputed to provide better handling in adverse road conditions, can really make for a much less comfortable ride.
Conversely, oversized tires can add a little extra cushion and even improve mileage somewhat, but require more torque to move, and can affect performance as a result.
Usually there is a little slack as far as tire/wheel sizes, especially on trucks, but if you intend to make that change for whatever reason, try them on first and make sure they clear your front wheel wells and cowling when turning, and don't scrape when you hit bumps. If you have these problems, but insist on the wheel/tire change, you're going to need a minor lift.

"
"
Consider adding torsion bars.,
Try out a lift kit.,
Pick out the right size of lift kit.,
Look at the contents of your lift kit.",How to Upgrade Your Suspension3," Many trucks have adjustable torsion bars, which will allow you to make adjustments to the ride height in the front of the vehicle, raising it to match a lift in the rear, or lowering it to keep it level if the rear springs are being taxed, rendering that 'saggy bottom' look.


Check your owners manual for adjustment procedures or better yet, since you will need a re-alignment after adjusting your ride height, just take it in and let your alignment specialist do it for you.
Torsion bar adjustment in the front along with leaf spring helpers in the back, and heavy duty shocks all the way around, and you can keep your truck level, or hike it up, or even give it a fancy aggressive 'rake'.
Keep in mind that torsion bar adjustments do not increase your travel range; only the clearance of your wheel well over your tire, which for our purposes should be plenty.

, Use your best judgment when it comes to using a lift kit. Lift kits can be found that provide an inch, two inches, three inches and so on, until you are replacing every single component of your suspension from sway bars to tie rods just to keep up with your hunger for more clearance and ride height.


Don't get carried away. Just a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference, and every time you add to your clearance height, you have to get new shocks to match, and at some point you're just sacrificing stability and reliability, as well as making it harder to get into your trunk or truck bed.
If you want to go full mud-bogger monster truck, you'll find instructions for that elsewhere. For now, consider this to be the last resort for keeping your cushy old Chevy from scraping wheels and dragging your trailer tongue every time the road gets a little bumpy.

, You've already got spring helpers and better shocks in place, and you are still riding low in the back. Go for a 2"" (or even a 1.5"") lift kit.


For coil springs this is usually another polyurethane insert, that just lowers the point where your spring connects to the chassis. For leaf springs this is just a shim that goes where your springs come into contact with your axle, and sometimes with shackles to adjust where they connect on the chassis side.
If you are very lucky, you can boost up the rear end (again, matching heavy duty shocks, of a length that reflects your lift) and just use torsion bars to compensate and level your front ride height.
In some cases (where there are no adjustable torsion bars) you'll need a lift kit that covers all four wheels, unless you are okay with having your rear end sitting higher than your front when your vehicle is unloaded.

, More complete, well rounded lift kits can be found which actually include longer springs and shocks and peripheral hardware.


If you really want or need a couple of extra inches, these present a trade off, removing some doubts and calculations for getting everything to match up, but require some serious work to install. If you have the resources, consider a professional installation.
In any case, once you are lifted, be mindful of your alignment, and make adjustments, or better yet, take it in and have your alignment professionally dialed in.

Evaluate the parts from which you need to remove paint.,
Choose your work area.,
Lay plastic drop cloths around the entire work area.

,
Remove all parts that do not need to be stripped.,
Choose your paint stripper.,
Put on your dust mask.,
Put on your respirator mask, rubber gloves and goggles.

,
Pour an ample amount of paint stripper in a large open can.

,
Apply the paint stripper to the car parts with the wide paintbrush.,
Leave the stripper to work and soften the paint, according to the package directions.,
Remove the paint with a plastic scraper.,
Paint on a light coat of stripper after almost all the paint has been removed.,
Wipe the surface of the parts with a lacquer thinner.,
Sand the surface of the parts with a dual action sander, using 80-grit sanding discs.,
Dispose of rubber gloves, plastic drop cloths and sheeting, brushes, the tin can and all other affected materials in a disposal area for toxic chemicals.",How to Remove Paint from Car Parts," If they are delicate or very expensive and you do not have many tools, it is a good idea to take the parts to a specialist for restoration.;
, It must be well ventilated, since chemical stripper is very toxic if used in a small, closed workspace. Make sure it is also in the shade, because the chemicals may evaporate too quickly in the sun.

,, If you cannot move something, use a masking tape or duct tape to cover the parts very carefully. Apply masking tape to openings and seams between panels. Press down the masking tape to remove any air bubbles.


If you are removing paint around windows, cover them with plastic sheeting and duct tape. Press down the duct tape to remove air bubbles.
It is all right if the tape overlaps onto the paint. These areas will need to be sanded later on.

, Heavy duty or aircraft paint stripper works well. The stronger the paint stripper, the more quickly it will remove the paint and the more toxic it will be. 2 to 3 gallons (7.5 to 11.5 l) of paint stripper would be a good amount to buy for a medium sized car.

, Scuff the surface of the parts with 40-grit sandpaper. This will allow the stripper to be absorbed better and work more quickly.

,,, Work carefully to cover all areas. Do not brush back and forth. Dab on the paint stripper in thick coats in 1 direction.


Add paint stripper until all areas look wet. You should see it begin to work. The paint appears to bubble up. Do not try to remove it right away.

, Do not attempt to strip the paint before that time.

, The amount that the paint softened will be uneven. In some areas, it is likely that all the paint will be removed in 1 try. In other places, you may have to repeat 2 to 3 times. Always wait the directed amount before attempting to remove the paint.

, Rub with a scouring pad, to remove small pieces of paint.

, This will remove any dried stripper and some paint, and make the parts less likely to rust.

, Use the sander to remove paint and create a surface on which a future primer can attach.


Remove tape and sand leftover paint with the dual action sander.

, You may need to call businesses in your area, and possibly pay to dispose of this waste.

Sometimes what appears to be a scratch is actually a raised line of material from an impact. This occurs when your car contacts another bumper or any object whose coating is softer than your car paint. These imperfections require much less work to remove.;
, After you have actually determined that you do have some scratches that need repair, you need to figure out how deep the scratch is. This will determine how you approach repairs. Scratches to the clear coat can be easily fixed by following these steps.
/images/thumb/e/e8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e8/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-2-Version-2.jpg










Your car has 4 main layers: clear coat, color, primer and steel. If the scratch is only as deep as the clear coat or color, it will be much easier to remove. If you can see a different color or steel, the scratch is deep and might be more difficult to repair at home.

, While you may have one scratch that is bothering you enough to start a repair project, it's a good idea to look for any other areas that could be repaired at the same time. If you already have the tools and materials to do the job, why not do it all the way!

Pay particular attention to the area you will be repairing. Spray the scratched area with water, making sure to get any debris out of the scratch.

, Wrap 2000-grit wet/dry sandpaper around a sanding pad and begin sanding.The goal is to sand just through the clear coat and no further.
/images/thumb/e/e5/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/e/e5/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-5-Version-2.jpg










Always sand in the direction of the scratch.You do not want to create opposing scratches, which will only create more ridges and valleys in the paint that need to be repaired.
Periodically rinse the area with water. This will allow you to better see if you have gotten to the bottom of the scratch.
If the scratch is slightly deeper than the clear coat, use 1500-grit sandpaper initially to level the surface and then 2000-grit sandpaper to remove the scratches made by the coarser sandpaper.
Avoid getting dirt or debris between the sandpaper and the vehicle. This will cause scratching.

, Use good quality and clean microfiber cloths to wipe dry the surface. Remember that using old rags could simply cause more scratches on the surface of your car!

Rubbing compound is an abrasive that takes off a bit more of the paint surface but it also smoothes out the paint surface, getting it ready to be waxed. Basically the rubbing compound is used to take out the scratches from the sandpaper., Turn the buffer on its lowest level and move it around for approximately 10 seconds. You need to polish the rubbing compound relatively quickly, so that it does not dry before being smoothed out./images/thumb/b/bd/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/b/bd/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-8-Version-2.jpg










Increase the speed to 2000 RPM and buff for one minute. You should be moving the buffer from side to side and then moving downward slowly.
Continue until the dullness has faded but make sure not to go through the paint layer. This might take up to five minutes depending on the scratch and your speed and pressure.
Do not buff in the same spot for more than a second. You will scratch into the next layer if you buff in the same spot too long.

, Use clean water and a towel to remove the leftover compound residue from the paint surface. If the compound got in any crevices, use a toothbrush to clean it out./images/thumb/c/ca/Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Remove-Scratches-from-Car-Step-9-Version-2.jpg

Always wipe off the leftover rubbing compound immediately after buffing. The residue will adhere to the paint and be more difficult to remove otherwise.

, Apply a good quality carnauba wax to the surface and then buff the surface with a random orbital buffer.

Check local regulations.,
Find a safe place to sand.,
Wear appropriate safety gear.,
Choose the appropriate sand paper.,
Sand only as much as you have to.",How to Remove Paint From Auto Fiberglass1," It is illegal in many areas to sand paint from the fiberglass components off your car in the open air, while other places permit it if you use special attachments on a vacuum as you sand to catch as much particulate as possible. Check on the website for your town or state for laws in your area.The particulate from sanding off paint becomes airborne and can be bad for the environment.
In some places, it is illegal to sand the paint off of your vehicle without a specialized facility.;
, Because the particulate you sand off of your vehicle can be hazardous to breath, find an isolated or enclosed area you can sand your vehicle. Sanding out in the open will allow the particulate to spread further, possibly effecting anyone who lives nearby.A garage with an air filtration system is the best environment to sand your vehicle.
If you are sanding outdoors, try to wait for a day that has very little wind.

, Because of the dangers of airborne particulate while sanding, be sure to wear goggles and a respirator. You may consider using a regular paper or cloth face mask, but you will need to replace the mask periodically if dust becomes caked onto the mask.Goggle style safety glasses are required to prevent the paint from getting into your eyes.
You can purchase respirators at most hardware and auto parts stores.

, You will need multiple grades of sandpaper to remove the paint and leave a smooth surface in the fiberglass. Start with 120 grit sandpaper and sand in a back and forth or circular motion to begin removing the paint. Switch to a finer grade sandpaper like 80 grit once you have removed the majority of the paint and re-sand the area.Don’t worry about making the fiberglass completely smooth; a slightly abrasive surface will help the new paint stick.
Be careful not to sand beyond the paint and through the fiberglass.
If you choose to use a power sander, be careful not to sand too deep through the paint with either grit of paper.

, If you are planning on repainting the surface, you don’t need to remove all of the paint from the fiberglass. Instead, use the 120 grit sandpaper to remove any loose or bubbled paint, then score the rest of the surface by lightly sanding over all of it.The new paint will stick to the scored paint you left on the fiberglass.
Make sure to wash and rinse the part before repainting the fiberglass. It will be covered in dust from the sanding process.

Choose an appropriate paste paint stripper.,
Use painters tape to mask off edges.,
Put down drop clothes.,
Determine cure time using a test patch.",How to Remove Paint From Auto Fiberglass2," There are a number of various paint stripper products available on the market. Choose a paint stripper that states it is intended for use on fiberglass on the package. A paint stripper paste is likely your best bet if you are removing paint from a component that is still on the vehicle.Paste paint stripper is less likely to drip off of the fiberglass as it cures.
All paint strippers can be dangerous to fiberglass if used improperly.

, If you are not stripping the paint from the entire vehicle, use blue painters tape to mark the edges of where you intend to strip the paint from. This will provide you with a barrier to guide you as you apply the paint stripper.Make sure to mark off the entire area you intend to strip.

, Because you will need to leave the paint stripper on the paint for an extended period of time, make sure you put down drop clothes below where you applied it. This will catch any paint or stripper that falls from the vehicle as it cures.Paint stripper and the paint it removes are bad for the environment, so it’s important to catch it and dispose of it appropriately.
Be sure to apply the paint stripper under a roof of some sort so rain can’t wash any of it away as it cures.

, Apply a small amount of paint stripper to an area of the fiberglass and allow it to cure. Read the instructions on the paint stripper to determine how long it should take for it to completely cure.Check the stripper periodically to see if it has removed the paint beneath it.
Keep track of how long it takes to remove the paint without damaging the fiberglass beneath it.

Apply the paint stripper to the fiberglass.,
Allow it to cure for the appropriate amount of time.,
Scrape the paint and the stripper off.,

Reapply the stripper when necessary.",How to Remove Paint From Auto Fiberglass3," Follow the directions on the paint stripper to apply it to the painted fiberglass. Most paste strippers will come with an application dowel. Spread the stripper onto the painted fiberglass evenly in the thickness indicated in the directions.Different types of paint strippers will have different application instructions.
Gel based paint strippers are usually applied with a brush.

, Leave the paint stripper on the paint for the amount of time you determined it would take to cure during the test. Make sure you do not leave the stripper on for much longer, as it can begin to eat away at the fiberglass if left on too long.If you remove the paint stripper too soon, you will need to apply another coat to get the remainder of the paint off.

, Some paint strippers need to be scraped off after curing to remove the paint. If the stripper came with a tool to use, scrape the stripper and paint off with it. If not, use a plastic scraper to remove the paint and stripper.A metal scraper may damage the fiberglass you are removing the paint from.
If the fiberglass is curved, use a scraper with a smaller width so you can better control how you apply pressure on the fiberglass.

, If the paint stripper you purchased instructs you to rinse it off rather than scrape it, use a hose to spray the paint stripper off. These paint strippers are designed to be drained and will not harm the environment.Do not use a high pressure washer to rinse the paint stripper off, as it may cause it to splash into your eyes.
A regular garden hose will suffice to rinse this kind of paint stripper off.

, After removing all of the paint stripper, evaluate the fiberglass and determine if you need to reapply paint stripper to any areas. If so, repeat the process until you remove all of the necessary paint.If there are any small nooks or edges in the fiberglass, it may take multiple tries to remove the paint.

Park the car on top of a large tarp or drop cloth to contain the old paint.,
Use masking tape to cover the areas of the car that won't be sanded.,
Place a disk of 80-grit sandpaper onto a dual-action sander.,
Sand the top of the car, beginning at the roof and moving to the hood, fenders, doors, trunk, and rear fenders.,
Work the sander against the car, and work on 1 panel at a time until the bare metal is showing.,
Remove the sander from the air compressor, and use the open end of the air compressor hose to blow the dust off of the car.",How to Remove Paint From a Car Exterior," The old paint should be disposed of instead of letting it contaminate the ground. If an open area is not available, park the car inside a garage, but open all of the garage's windows and doors for ventilation. Cover objects inside the garage to protect them from the paint dust.;
, Apply several layers of masking tape to chrome trim or other exterior accessories so the sandpaper doesn't scratch them. The weather stripping, tail lights, and headlights should also be covered.

, Place the sander on the surface of the car, and turn it on. The sander vibrates constantly and moves around very quickly in small circles. Keep the sander moving back and forth along the length of the vehicle to remove old paint. Moving the sander up and down can actually create imperfections in the finished paint.

, Keep the sander moving so the sheet metal on the car doesn't heat up enough to warp, which can happen if the sander is held in one place longer than several seconds.

, Change the sandpaper disk after each large panel so that the paper is not too smooth. Once finished, turn off the sander.

, Blow the paint dust out of crevices and openings such as around the bumper and below the windshield. Start at the roof and work down to the bottom of the car.

Use only a foam brush to remove snow.,
Pull the snow from the vehicle in a straight line.,
Move across the entire vehicle.,
Do not attempt to scrape off snow completely.,
Use your car's settings to help speed up the process.,
Use a commercial de-icer liquid to remove ice.,
Use vinegar if you do not have de-icer.,
Try rubbing alcohol if you do not have other things on hand.,
Do not use hot water to de-ice your windshield.,
Do not use anything but a car scraper.,
Take measures to prevent a reoccurrence.",How to Remove Ice from a Car," The only tools you should ever use to remove snow from a car are tools specifically designed for this purpose. Other tools, such as a shovel, could potentially damage your car. Purchase a foam brush at a hardware store or online., A foam brush works best if you pull the snow rather than pushing it. Moving in a straight line from the top of the car, pull the snow forward across the car. You will be pulling backwards across the top of your car, drawing a vertical line through the snow.Eventually, snow will start to spill from your car from behind and off the side as you move your brush along in a series of straight lines.

, Keep making straight lines with your brush, moving from the front of the car backwards. Using this method, the bulk of the snow will eventually fall off the sides and back of the car., The only snow you should remove is snow that poses a safety risk. Snow on the roof, which could blow off and obstruct other drivers' views, and snow on the windshield should be removed. If there is stuck-on snow on the car, avoid trying to scrape it off. Stuck-on snow usually does not pose a risk, unless it obstructs visibility, and scraping can damage your car., Turn the heat setting up as high as possible. Turn off the inside air circulation and, if possible, crack open the windows slightly. This should help the ice melt faster., For best results, only use a commercial de-icer, as it's safer and more effective than using home methods. Spray your de-icer on your windshield. Start at the top and work your way down. Use a scraper after the de-icer is applied to gently scrape the ice off your car.Use broad strokes and move across the glass completely. You should not just clear of the driver’s side, as leaving the passenger side covered inhibits visibility.

, Mix a three-to-one ratio of vinegar-to-water in a spray bottle. Mist this onto your windshield. Use a scraper to move across the windshield in broad motions, gradually removing ice from your full windshield., Mix a third cup (80 mL) of water and two thirds a cup (160 mL) of rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Mist this solution onto your windshield. Then, use your scraper to make broad strokes, removing ice from the full scope of the windshield., Many people pour hot water on the windshield as a means to remove ice. This is very dangerous as the shock of the hot water can easily cause your windshield to crack. Never pour hot water on an icy car., Things like credit cards and other sharp objects should never be used on your windshield in place of a scraper. Not only could these objects be damaged, they could scratch up your car or windshield. Only use a car scraper to remove ice from your car., If you simply remove ice from your car and then park it as usual the next day, more ice will probably accumulate in the morning. To prevent a reoccurrence, soak a towel in water and table salt. Place it over your car window before bed. In the morning, less ice will have built up on your car."

Make sure you need new shocks.,
Purchase new shock absorbers.,
Consider upgrading your shocks.,
Jack your vehicle in an appropriate location.,
Check the shock mountings and spray them with metal cleaner.,
Remove bolts from the shock tower.,
Disconnect the shock from the suspension.,
Remove the shock absorber from the bottom and top bolts.,
Fit the new shock back onto the suspension control arm.,
If needed, you may once again affix the anti-roll bar if you removed it earlier.,
Check your torque specs in the service manual.,
Repeat the steps to replace the other 3 shock absorbers, if necessary.",How to Replace Shocks," You might have noticed going over potholes and bumps isn't as smooth as it used to be in your ride, which is probably a sign that your shocks are worn out and need replaced. A good easy way to test your shocks and make sure they're worn out enough to be replaced is to push down hard on the trunk or the hood directly above the wheel well. Good shocks should bounce up once and settle relatively quickly. If the body bounces any more than that after pushing, it's time for a new set.


You also need to know if your vehicle uses stand-alone shocks that attach to the vehicle suspension or frame, or if it uses shock-absorber units which integrated into a suspension strut, such as the MacPherson or Chapman strut. Your car may even have a combination, using shocks in the front and struts in the back. Struts can be difficult to replace, so it's best to let a professional handle that job.;
, If you're unsure what type of shock absorbers you need, speak to someone at your local auto parts store or an auto mechanic to be sure you buy the right shock absorbers or piston for your vehicle.

, You can get identical replacements of the shocks you have in your car currently, but taking the time to change out your shocks is also a good opportunity to perform any upgrades, if you're interested. Performance shocks are appropriate for heavy-use daily drive vehicles, especially trucks.Coil shocks are manufactured with a coiled spring around the body of the shock, which supports the weight of the vehicle and controls the movement of the suspension. These are adjustable, which means you can alter the height of your truck for optimum performance.

Twin-tube shocks have a set of tubes, one inner and one out, that house the piston, along with a layer of shock fluid and air, which can have a tendency to create a foamy, frothy mixture that can affect performance, though some modern variations feature a nitrogen mixture that addresses the issue. These are common on off-road vehicles.

Monotube shocks feature a tube and two pistons, which work essentially like the twin-tube shocks work, with one piston separating the layer of nitrogen from the air. It runs cool and is a popular performance choice for trucks.

Reservoir shocks are filled with fluid, and either pressurized air or nitrogen. As the shock absorbs bounce, the fluid contacts the gas, causing resistance and dampening the spring action.

, Park your car on a level surface and loosen the lug nuts on both sides of the front or back end. Secure your vehicle with ramps and/or jack stands. Check your owner's manual for the correct jack positioning. When you've got the car up, remove the wheels and locate the shocks.


Shocks will be affixed with a vertical bolt that has to be extracted from within the engine bay or the trunk, or may be positioned at the top by a horizontal bolt that has to be unfastened and knocked out of position.

, The most difficult part of the job is removing the old shocks, which can have a tendency to be really gunky with both age and road-grit, making the bushings and bolts somewhat difficult to remove. Check out the mountings to see if they're loose enough to get off, or if you're likely to crack the rubber around the bushing. It's ok if you do, since you're changing out the shock anyway, but it's usually easier to spray some WD-40 or PB Blaster in there and let it sit for a few minutes to try to loosen things up before you get to work.

, Lots of cars have the top bolts under the fabric in the trunk of the car, which means you'll have to lift up the lining to get to the shock bolts and remove them with a ratchet and socket. As always, consult your shop manual for more specific guidelines regarding the location of the shock tower bolts. In general, though, they'll be in the trunk.


To unfasten the bolts, turn the socket and ratchet counterclockwise, greasing the bolts with penetrating fluid to eliminate any surface rust, if necessary.

, Use a socket set or a nut splitter to disengage the nut that connecting the shock to the suspension, and remove it from the bolt. If there isn't enough room to operate the splitter, you can apply penetrating solvent.


Depending on the assembly, you may also need to disengage the knuckle at the top of brake assembly to get the the shock. Consult your owner's manual to find out for sure. Use the same process to remove the nut that is positioned at the top and keep the nuts separate so you will know which one goes where when it is time to install your new shocks., Wiggling the shock off the bolts can be surprisingly difficult, especially if the shocks are mounted on studs with a retaining bracket and everything's rusty. Wiggle it around a while and it should come off eventually.


One common frustration occurs when your piston rod keeps turning with you as you're trying to loosen the nut. You can use locking pliers on the end of the rod and keep it from turning with the pliers while loosening the nut with a wrench, but that can be just as frustrating. There's a hollow hex kit that fits over the rod and a tailored wrench made for the purpose, available at any auto parts store for about eleven bucks.
If you need to bang on the bolt with a hammer or the end of your wrench to get it loose, that's ok, but make sure you put one the nuts back on to use as a hitting surface. Don't risk misaligning the bolt and messing up your ability to reinstall the shock properly. Let the metal cleaner do its work and take your time. It'll give.

, You might need to use some pressure to constrict the shock as it falls into place, and you might need a help to help lift the suspension back up to reinstall the bolts in the correct positions. It can be kind of a balancing act, so it helps to have another set of hands. Screw on the nuts hand tight.

, Reattach it and screw the bolts back on hand-tight. Replace the shock tower nuts you removed at the beginning of the process, probably in the trunk of the vehicle.

, Before you go tightening everything back down, recheck the specifications for torque to be sure everything's secure.

, Most of the shocks should wear out at the same time, so if you're going to do one, you're probably going to end up doing them all. Do in following the same steps and then put the wheels back on and tighten the lug nuts to finish the job.

Pull the wheel toward you.,
Use a rubber mallet to loosen stuck on wheels.",How to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires1," Before jacking the car up, use your wrench or tire iron to break the lug nuts loose. Do not remove them completely, but turn them a quarter turn or so in the counter-clockwise direction each to make them loose enough to unscrew while the vehicle is in the air.You can purchase tire irons from your local auto parts stores that usually have an end that fits all vehicles.
You may also choose to simply use a deep socket of the appropriate size with a ratchet or breaker bar.;
, Because the lug nuts are already loose from before you lifted the car, they should be fairly easy to unscrew the rest of the way. Use a wrench if need be to turn the lug nuts counter-clockwise until they come off of the lug studs.The wheel may shift as you remove the lug nuts, so watch your fingers for pinches.
Remove the lug nuts across from one another in a star pattern, rather than each one in a row.

, If the lug nuts have rusted over, apply a generous amount of a thread loosener or rust remover to the nuts. Allow it to sit for a few minutes, then attempt to loosen the lug nut again.If the lug nut and stud break, you will need to have a new lug stud installed in order to repair the vehicle.
Be sure to use the correct sized socket. A socket that is slightly too large could round off the lug nut.
A stripped or rounded lug nut will have to be cut off by a professional.

, Place the lug nuts in a safe place to be sure you don’t lose them. If you lose a lug nut, you may be able to secure the wheel temporarily with the remaining nuts, but if you lose more than one, it will not be safe to drive the vehicle until they have been replaced.You can purchase replacement lug nuts at your local auto parts store.
Store the lug nuts in a small bowl or container so they can’t roll away as you work.

, Once the lug nuts have been removed, place your hands on either side of the tire. Grip the back of the tire and pull it toward you to remove the wheel from the lug studs. If the wheel has not been removed in a long time, it may require quite a bit of force to pull the wheel off.Be careful, if the tire is damaged there may be metal wire sticking out of it that can cut you.
Wear gloves to pull on a damaged tire.

, If the wheel is seized in place and won’t come off from you pulling on it, use a rubber mallet to bang it loose. Strike the tire where the rim and tire meet all along the circumference of the wheel until it breaks loose.Do not use a metal hammer to hit the rims or you may damage them.
It may take a good deal of force to remove the wheel if it is rusted in place.

",How to Plasti‐Dip 10 Spoke Wheels," Typically when applying plastic-dip, the working space should be indoors. If the weather permits, the process can be completed outside as well. If working indoors, there should be functioning ventilation and minimum temperature of 60 degrees. If working outdoors; there must be no rain, minimal wind, and at least 60 degrees.;
, Gather all the materials/equipment in the Things You'll Need section at the bottom of the article., With your jack, lift up the front-end or back-end of your vehicle depending on your preference, and place your jack-stands in their designated places. Place bricks behind two wheels that are not being taken off.

, Using your torque wrench/gun, carefully remove all the lug-nuts off the wheels of the lifted side. Once the lug-nuts are off, you can now take off the wheels and place them face up on your working space.

, If you are accessible to a power washer, power-washing your wheels with water will do the job. If you do not have a power washer handy, using the cleaner listed in the Materials/Equipment section will work. Clean/wash until no dirt/stains/debris is visible then dry completely.

, Take the 3x5 index cards or playing cards and tuck them in between the rim and tire of the wheels. Ensure the tires are not exposed through the cards because if plasti-dip were to fall on the tires, it would be very difficult to take the plasti-dip off the tires.

, Plasti-Dip is a rubber based spray paint, thus requiring a significant amount of shaking prior to application. Shake the can vigorously for about 2-3 minutes. When lines and/or dots appear on the bottom of the can, the can is ready for spraying., Working on one wheel at a time, this first coat should be a relatively light coating. With the can in hand and 10-12 inches away from the wheel, begin by spraying the entire outside lip of the wheel in a sweeping motion. Then spray the spokes vertically, working on one pair of spokes at a time. After the spokes, spray a coating in the center of the rim. Now both wheels should be completely covered in a light coating of plasti-dip, quickly spray over any spots you may have missed.

, If indoors, give the wheels 15-20 minutes to dry. If outdoors, give 15-20 minutes as well. If there is sunlight outside, the wheels will dry faster - 10-15 minutes. *Tip: The more time you give your wheels to dry, the better the end result.*

, By now, the first coating should be completely dry. Be sure to vigorously shake the cans again before the second coat. This coating should be heavy, so you should be spraying the wheel with a slower sweep.


Spraying method should be the same as the method used in Step 2 of Part 2.
Since your sweeping motion is slower for this coat, shake the can after every section/spoke.

, Though it is a heavier coating, the drying time is roughly the same as the first coating. 15-20 minutes if indoors, 10-15 minutes if outside with sunlight, or 15-20 if out without sunlight., The first and second coatings are the only required coatings when Plasti-Dipping wheels. The first coat is required in order for the following coats to settle instead of run down the spokes. The second coat is required so that it is possible to remove the Plasti-Dip off, or else the first coat will be permanent.

Follow Steps 1 and 2 from this part when spraying the remaining coats on the wheels.

, At this point, you should have completely finishing Plasti-Dipping two wheels. When you are certain that the two wheels are dry, carefully install them back onto your vehicle. Remove the jack stands and jack up the opposite side and place the jack stands on that side. Carefully remove the last two wheels and begin Parts 1-3 again., You have now completed Plasti-Dipping your wheels. Once the wheels are dry, carefully remove the cards from the wheels without dragging the cards.

, It is now safe to put the wheels back onto your vehicle. Make sure all the lug-nuts are securely torqued.

, Remove the jack stands, and carefully lower your vehicle.

, I know you're anxious to show off your new aesthetic wheels, but it is recommended to wait a few hours before driving.

The paint is fairly fresh, driving will potentially cause dirt and other debris to stick to the wheels.

Locate the designated jack points for the vehicle.,
Close the valve on the jack.,
Place the jack beneath the appropriate jack point.,
Use the jack to lift the vehicle.,
Only jack the car up as high as necessary.",How to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires2," Each vehicle has specific points on the frame that are designed to withstand the weight of jacking up the vehicle. These jack points are not always easily identified, so refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to help you find them if you are having difficulty.There are usually jack points on the frame of your car to the inside of each wheel, and at a center point on the front and back of the car.
Jacking the car up at a point that is not designed for it can cause damage to the frame of the vehicle.

, Trolley jacks utilize hydraulics to lift your vehicle off of the ground. When the hydraulic valve is open, the jack can’t create pressure on the piston to lift the car. Use the handle of the jack to turn the valve clockwise until it is completely closed. Re-insert the handle into the jack once done if you used the handle to close the valve. Different jacks may place the valve in different places, but it is often a different color than the rest of the jack or is left unpainted completely.
If you are using a scissor jack, there is no valve you need to close.

, Slide your jack beneath the jack point closest to the wheel you intend to remove so the cup of the jack is sitting just beneath the frame. You may need to raise the cup of the jack slightly by lifting the jack handle and pressing it back down or spinning it once to make sure the jack is positioned properly.The cup on the jack should be centered on the designated jack point for the vehicle.
There are teeth or ridges on the cup of the jack to help prevent the car’s frame from sliding as it’s jacked up.

, Depending on the type of jack you are using, you will need to either raise and lower the handle (on a trolley jack) or turn it (on a scissor jack) to raise the vehicle. Start slow, paying close attention to the frame around the jack point to look for signs of bending or crimping of the metal.If you see signs that the metal is bending, lower the car and reposition the jack unto the jack point properly.

, Raising a vehicle up too high can increase the danger of it falling off of the jack or jack stands. Once it is high enough to change the tire, place jack stands beneath it for safety.Do not place any part of your body under the vehicle unless you have jack stands in place to support it.
You only need to lift the vehicle up until the tire is no longer touching the ground to remove it.

As a result, it is essential that you jack your car up in an area that can support the pressure. Concrete and blacktop are the best options for jacking up the car. It is extremely unsafe to jack a vehicle up on an angle, so it is also very important that you choose a level surface.Never jack up a vehicle on slanted or uneven surfaces.
Jacking a car up on a surface that isn’t strong enough can cause the jack to topple over or sink.

, Whether you’re using an emergency jack or a trolley jack, it’s important to ensure you have enough room to work without putting yourself or others at risk. Make sure you have at least enough room to stand with an outstretched arm toward the jack without coming into contact with a wall or being in the street if you are replacing a flat tire.Make sure there’s enough room to sit behind your jack without being in the lane of the road.

, If your car is equipped with an automatic transmission, it should be in park before you jack it up. Putting your car in park prevents the wheels from turning and will keep the vehicle from rolling off of the jack. Remember, however, your car may still shift when in park, so it’s important to utilize wheel chocks in conjunction with placing the vehicle in park.Remember that putting the car in park will lock its drive wheels in place, so a front wheel drive car’s front wheels won’t turn in park, and vice versa for a rear wheel drive vehicle.
If your car is equipped with a manual transmission, try putting the car in first gear to prevent it from rolling.
You can place rocks or plastic wheel chocks purchased from an auto parts store behind the wheels to ensure they can’t turn while you lift the vehicle.

, Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, the parking brake may be a handle in the center console or a pedal on your left side when sitting in the driver’s seat. Pull up on the handle or press down on the pedal to engage the parking brake and prevent your vehicle from rolling while it’s being jacked up.Your owner’s manual can help you locate your parking brake if you are unsure.
The parking brake locks the rear wheels in place, so it will not help if the entire back end of the car is in the air.

Apply the glue and patch.,
Test the inner tube for leaks.,
Assemble the tire.,
Inflate the tire and mount the tire.

",How to Patch a Flat Tire," Use a small tire iron/lug wrench and a large screwdriver to work your way around the tire. You will need two tools at a minimum. Be careful not to pinch the inner tube with the tools as you work the tire free from the rim.;
, Inflate the inner tube and coat the tire with very soapy water or submerge the tire in tub tub or kitchen sink. Mark the spot where the air is coming out of the tire.

, For the patch to hold, the inner tube must be dry and free of dirt and oil. Thoroughly dry the inner tube, then clean the area around the leak with denatured alcohol. (Note that this is different than the rubbing alcohol you use as a disinfectant.)

, The repair kit likely has a metal device that looks like a Parmesan cheese grater. Lightly rub this over the area around the hole. Alternatively use a piece of 50-200 grit sandpaper to lightly roughen the area before applying the patch.

, Trim the patch so that it covers the hole and extends for about one inch beyond the hole in all directions. Rounded patches are best.

, Follow the directions on the patch kit. Put a moderate amount of glue on both the inner tube surface and the patch. Hold the patch firmly in place for a minute or two, then let dry for another 15-30 minutes. Again, follow the directions in the patch kit. Each glue and patch formulation is a bit different.

, Reinflate the inner tube and coat the patched area with soapy water. No soap bubbles should form. If they do, peel back the part of the patch that leaks and reglue.

, After you have determined that the inner tube is holding air and the leak has been repaired, deflate the inner tube and put it on the rim, then put the tire back on the rim.

Drive your car.",How to Patch a Tire," In order to find a leak the tire must be properly pressurized. You should inflate your tire with air until it reaches the appropriate pressure (measured in psi) specified in your vehicle’s service manual.;
, Before moving on to more time consuming techniques, you should take a moment to look at your tire. If you notice any holes, cuts, or objects protruding from tire then you have found your leak.

, Even if you aren't able to see the problem right away you might be able to hear it. A hissing sound is a clear sign that air is leaking from your tire, and can help you locate the leak.

, If you run your hands over the tire carefully you may feel the leak even if you can't hear or see it.

, If you followed the steps above and you were not able to easily find the leak don’t fear. Spraying the tire with a little soapy water or window cleaner may help. If you see bubbling at any place on the surface of the tire then you have found your leak., You can use a spray bottle to spray the tire, or if a spray bottle isn’t available you can just pour the mixture over the tire.

, As air escapes the tire and encounters the soapy water mixture it will form soap bubbles. If you notice the soapy water bubbling at any particular place on the tire, you have found your leak.

, It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.

, Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:


Your service manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.

, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.

, Mark this spot with chalk or markers as it is obviously where your leak will be.


When there's no protruding item, follow the above steps for locating a leak and then mark it.

, Use a valve stem core remover to remove the valve stem core. This is a special two pronged tool that you use to unscrew the valve stem core from the center of the valve stem and pull it out. This releases the tire pressure so that you can break the bead.

, To remove the tire, use a tire spoon and a hammer to break the bead that seals the tire and rim. You will need to do this on both sides of the tire to completely remove it from the rim.

, There is a groove on the rim that is made to hold one side of the tire so that you can remove the other side. Once you get one side of the tire into this groove you can use the spoons to pry the other side of the tire off of the rim. Then work the spoons all the way around the tire until you have taken the first side of the tire completely off of the rim.

, Now that one side is completely removed from the rim, flip your tire over and use the spoons to pry the opposite side off of the rim as well. Now your tire will be completely separated from the rim.

, Select a pointy bit that will fit into the hole where the leak is. This will roughen up the sides and clean the area so that the patch will bond correctly when installed.

, Spray a ""Pre-Buff Cleaner"" on the inside of the tire where the patch will be installed. Use the grinding stone to clean and roughen up the area around the hole (about two inches in diameter around the hole). This will give the patch a clean surface to make bond with the tire.

, This will remove any dirt or debris created by the buffing process. It is important to have a clean surface for the patch to bond to.

, This will prevent water from entering the hole and moving its way into the tire’s tread. Let stand until the cement is ""tacky"" to touch.

, This is the side that will contact the inside of your tire.

, The pointy part should enter the hole from the inside of the tire and be pushed out through the outside. Use a pair of pliers to grip the pointy side of the patch. Pull this pointy part of the patch out from the tire's tread. This pulls the sticky part of the patch tightly to the inner side of the tire.

, This will remove any air bubbles in between the sticky side of the patch and the buffed surface. The patch is now sealed properly onto the tire.

, You should cover the whole patch and some of the tire. This makes sure that there will be absolutely no leaks!

, It should only take a couple of minutes. While you are waiting, use a pair of side cutters (or scissors) and cut the stem of the patch to be flush with the top of your tread.

, Go around bead of the tire (the inner ring that seals to the rim) and lubricate it with dish soap.

, Use the tire spoons to pry one side of the tire open and slide it back onto the rim. Once you have the first side on, repeat the same procedure for the second side.

, It is best practice not to reuse the valve stem core and to simply replace it anytime it is taken out.

, Fill the tire up to the correct pressure as specified on the sidewall of the tire or in your owner’s manual. This pressure will force the tire into the correct place on the rim and seal the bead.

, You should slide the wheel back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheel in place while the car is still on the jackstands.

, Use the floor jack to remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground..

, Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual. Be sure to tighten lugs in a star pattern.

, As long as the patch was successful, the repair will last as long as your tire is in use."

Pick up a tire pressure gage.",How to Put Air in a Tire1," You can find them at any auto parts store such as NAPA, AutoZone, Checker, Kragen, etc., or big-box stores like WalMart, Costco, Target, and others.


The pencil types look like little metal tubes, and a ruler-like gauge pops out the top showing the air pressure.
Dial gauges give you a very clear readout of your tire's pressure.
Digital gauges give you a LCD readout that requires no interpretation.

Purchase good quality tires.,
Inspect the new tires before agreeing to buy them.,
Try to replace all four tires at once.,
Read the instructions related to tires in the vehicle user's manual.,
Ensure that the tire balance has been checked upon fitting the tires after purchase.,
Inspect the tire pressure regularly.,
Inspect the wear of the tire tread regularly.,
Check the wheel alignment yearly.,
Rotate the tires as advised in the vehicle user's manual.,
Drive with a view to maintaining sensible speeds and avoiding actions that might harm the tires.",How to Protect New Tires," Not only should they be purchased from a reliable brand, but they should be the right tires for your vehicle type and the season. Check the vehicle user's manual for advice, and discuss your options with the retailer before purchasing.;
, They should be free of imperfections, such as nicks, cuts or holes. If you see anything that you're not sure about, ask first.


If purchasing used or reconditioned tires, check even more thoroughly, especially for puncture signs.
After purchase, do a regular check for cuts, holes, embedded stones, etc., at least every few days. The earlier you spot a problem, the easier it will be to fix the affected tire and keep it in good condition.

, This may be costly but it is safer, as all the tires will have the same amount of tread and there will be less chance of uneven wear caused by leaving on existing tires.If you do choose to only replace two tires, is recommended that you place the new tires on the rear axle. This is because the new grip will give you better control in difficult driving conditions, as the rear wheels are not connected to the steering wheel.However, this may depend on your vehicle's requirements, so always check the user's manual for advice.

, In addition, read the tire manufacturer's requirements. That way you will be aware of any unique requirements that are relevant to either your car or the tires you've purchased.

, Balancing is an important way to prevent early demise of your tires; get the tires balanced each time that you purchase new ones; they should balance properly on the wheel mounts.


If a tire is unbalanced, it will cause uneven wear on the tire tread. It can also cause the car to vibrate and front end parts of the car may also wear out faster.

, Do a monthly tire check when the tires are cold (at least three hours since driving). Check the tire pressure to see if it is at the point recommended by the vehicle user's manual. Tires that are under- or over-inflated will wear faster and won't perform as they should to maintain grip and keep you safe on the road. By maintaining the right pressure in your car's tires, you can help them to last longer.


Use a tire gauge to check the tires. These are available from auto supplies stores and hardware stores.
The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle can usually be found in the vehicle user's handbook, on the car manufacturer's website, on a label inside the door or inside the gas tank flap.
The inflation level shown on the tire refers to its maximum level of inflation, not the recommended tire pressure; don't confuse the two!

, At the same time that you do a monthly tire check, also check the tread for wear. Tread is related directly to grip and traction, so the more worn the tread is, the less grip it has. Worn tread on new tires is an indicator of a problem, and you should have the car checked by a mechanic to see what the problem might be and have it fixed quickly.

, It should also be checked as quickly as possible after hitting the wheels on something. For example, if you bang the wheels into a curb or into a pothole, etc., they may go out of alignment. If this misalignment is not corrected, the tires will wear faster and this may compromise your steering and safety.


Wheel alignment checking should also occur after noticing irregular tread wear.

, Rotation of the tires at the intervals advised by the manual can help preserve them for longer.

, Do not regularly screech to a halt, storm off from the traffic lights or speed over the mandated limit. All of these actions cause additional wear and tear on your tires and reduce the longevity of your tires (not to mention wasting fuel).

Find the recommended pressure.,
Check the tires when cool.,
Remove the screw-on cap from the valve.,
Attach the gauge.",How to Put Air in a Tire2," You can find this in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the driver-side door jamb, or in the glove compartment.


It may be the same for all four tires, or the front and rear tires may be different—it differs by model.
Normally, it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi (pounds per square inch) or 195 to 250 kPa (kilopascals).
You can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves, but use this only if you can't find the vehicle's recommended numbers. ""Maximum"" doesn't necessarily translate to ""best."" A good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi. Then find the proper pressure and correct as needed.;
, Warm air expands, and will give you a false reading of greater pressure.

, This is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel. Remove the cap, and put it where you won't lose it.









There are two kinds of valve stems: rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with TPMS (tire pressure monitoring systems).

, Place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem, and press down firmly. It may hear the hissing of air escaping; if so, press harder until the hissing stops. Read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure.









If the tire pressure matches the recommended number, replace the cap and move to the next tire. Repeat this process for all four tires, plus the spare. Should you run flat, it's not going to be helpful to have a flat spare!

"

Find air.,
Remove the valve cap.,
Turn on the compressor.,
Place the hose nozzle squarely onto the valve stem.,
Replace the cap.",How to Put Air in a Tire3," If you need to add air to your tires, and don't have a compressor laying about the house—most people don't—head for your nearest gas station. Make sure you bring a a couple dollars worth of quarters with you, as a few minutes of compressed air can cost $1.00USD or more.


A handy device to have around the garage is a portable tire inflator that it plugs into the 12v power socket in your car. It is available wherever tire pressure gauges are sold.

, This is the same cap and valve you used to check the pressure.








, This may be by a switch, if using a home compressor, or by plugging the machine with quarters, for a service station compressor. It'll start hissing.








, Press down firmly, just like you did with the pressure gauge, and squeeze the valve trigger. If it hisses loudly, press more firmly until the hissing stops or is minimized.









How much lower than normal your pressure was will determine how long you want to keep the compressor filling the tire. Most tire compressors have a sliding gauge coming out of the top that pops up when you release the valve trigger. Don't rely on it for total accuracy, but as a general guideline to see if you're getting close to your desired psi.
When close, use your own tire pressure gauge to check, and either add more air in short 5-second bursts, or use the gauge to press the pin inside the valve stem and let air out, if you've over-filled the tire.

, When each tire has been inflated to the proper pressure, replace the cap, and repeat for all 4 tires plus the spare.









If you had to drive more than a couple miles to the service station, your tires will warm up, and the air pressure will increase as a result. If your readings indicate that you need add, for example, 10psi to the tire, then add 10psi, no matter what the current reading says. Check a few hours later, after the tires have cooled down, to verify the correct inflation.

"
"
Buy a bicycle tire pressure gauge.,
Use a hand pump.,
Check your pressure before every ride.,
Don't over-inflate.",How to Put Air in a Tire4," Automobile tire pressure gauges will not accurately reflect the much higher psi levels of bicycle tires.

, Follow the other steps outlined, including checking the pressure when the tire's cold, and following the bicycle manual's guidelines.









You can use an air compressor to fill bicycle tires. Make sure you pay close attention to what you are doing. Fill the tire in short bursts and check the pressure often until you reach the desired pressure.

, Because of their size and dimensions, bicycle tires react more quickly to changes in ambient air temperature, and psi will drop in cooler weather. For every 10° drop in temperature, tire pressure will drop about 2%.


For example, if you head out during the day riding on 100psi and the temp is 90, when you head home that night, and it's now 60°, your tire pressure will be about 94 psi—enough change to be a noticeable difference.

, A tire that rolls great at 100 psi on a smooth road will deliver a harder ride on rough road. To help with traction on wet days, drop your psi by about 10.

Use a lug wrench or an impact to loosen the lug nuts.,
Jack up the car.,
Use jack stands to stabilize the car.,
Remove the lug nuts.,
Remove the wheel from the wheel base.,
Have the tires removed from your wheels.,
Remove your valve stem.",How to Paint Your Wheels1," This is the safest way to loosen your lugs. While the car is still on the ground, it puts pressure on the wheels. This holds the wheels in place and allows you to loosen the lugs without the wheel spinning.;
, Look in your service manual for recommended jacking points. This will help avoid any unnecessary damage to the vehicle. Place the jack under the jacking points and jack up the car.

, Although you need a jack to get the car in the air, a car resting on a jack is not safe. Again, consult a service manual for jacking points and slide the jack stands under those points. Lower the car with the jack and rest the car on the jack stands.


If you are lifting the front or back end there should be one on each side of the car. If you are lifting the whole car, there should be two on each side near each corner.

, Now that the car is in the air and well supported, you can remove your lug nuts. They should be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, use a lug wrench or impact to get them off.

, Once the lugs are removed, you can simply pull the wheel away from the car. Follow this same procedure for each of the four wheels. Move the wheels to a suitable workspace.

, It's very difficult to do this safely without specialized equipment, so it's best to have this done by a mechanic or tire shop.

While not strictly necessary, removing your tires reduces the time taken to mask off the rim, and eliminates the chance of overspray on your tires. Removing the tires will also help ensure that you can paint all the way to the edge of the rim with no interference.

, This step, like removing the tires, is optional. Removing the valve stem from your rims allows you to paint without masking it off. It also eliminates the difficulty of trying to paint at different angles to avoid missing parts of the rim that may be slightly blocked by the valve stem. This allows a more natural spraying motion and can result in a better overall paint job.

Locate the raised writing on the side of your vehicle's tires.,
Find the text that reads, ""recommended PSI"" or some similar text (PSI is ""pounds per square inch"" ) or refer to your owner's manual or tire dealer for your particular tires.,
Check your tire inflation level (PSI) in cold weather before driving your vehicle, when the car is cold (sitting for a minimum of 3 hours).,
Remove the valve-stem cap on 1 or all 4 tires (you will check all 4 tires).

,
Press your air-pressure gauge evenly over the valve stem until air stops escaping.

,
Read the pressure indicated on the metered stick that comes out of the gauge or on the digital screen of your digital gauge.

Repeat this process on the rest of your vehicle's tires.

,
Record the PSI readings for each of your tires.

,

Recheck the pressure in all 4 tires and check the readings against your original readings.,
Fit the air-hose onto 1 of your tire stems until air stops leaking.

,
Release air into your tire by either squeezing the handle on the hose or allowing the hose assembly to do it automatically.

,
Remove the hose periodically and recheck the pressure with your own gauge (public gauges can wear with time and produce inaccurate readings).

,
Continue to inflate your tire until you reach the recommended PSI.

,
Replace the caps on the valve stems.

,
Recheck your tire pressure each week during the cold weather.

Join a Yahoo Group or similar discussion group of enthusiasts interested in the same model Jeep as yours.,
Consider what you are trying to really accomplish.,
Look at various manufacturer's lift kits and prices to decide on the one that suits you best.,
Once you have obtained all the parts you need and have secured the tools and a garage or level driveway surface you are ready to begin.,
Follow the directions that came with the kit!,
Then you will remove the front shock absorbers and coil springs so they can be replaced with the taller parts.,
The directions will probably have you work the front end first and then make the rear end mods and possibly add some other mods involving for instance the transfer case mounts.

,
After completing the lift installation have someone move the steering from full left to full right while you inspect the moving parts for any sign of interference.,
Install your new tires and wheels.,
Lastly go straight to the alignment shop and get a complete front end alignment.,
Now head for the trails!",How to Lift a Jeep Suspension," They will be a great source of encouragement and equipment/method opinions plus be in a position to help solve the problems you may encounter.;
, Are you lifting your daily driver a few inches to accommodate larger tires and make it more trail worthy or are you building the ultimate trail rig that you will trailer to events? This is the most important step as it will dictate what you do during the remaining steps. Think about the need to get your vehicle inspected, how high of a lift do you want, what's involved with installing the lift (1-2 is fairly simple not requiring much; higher and you may need to adjusted/drop other parts on the vehicle - parts that may not be included in the lift kit), and most importantly your budget.

, The kits will range from a few spacers costing less than $100 to large groups of parts such as springs, shocks, track bars, control arms, steering components, extended brake lines, etc. for several thousand dollars.

, It is assumed here that you have the mechanical skills and tools to accomplish the job safely. If you have any doubt about this consider having your lift kit professionally installed.

, Depending on the extent and type of kit, the directions will most likely begin with ""support the front end of the vehicle on sturdy jack stands on a level surface and remove the wheels and tires."" This is an essential step for ensuring your safety during the installation and allows access to the suspension parts.

, Depending on the kit you may also replace or modify control arms, brake lines, track bars, and the Pitman arm steering part. Again stick to the kit manufacturer's directions as they vary too much to be more specific here.

,, Solve any problems before attempting to operate the vehicle.

, Repeat the left to right steering test for any signs of interference. Do this both on the ground as well as with each side jacked up (separately) to maximum suspension flex to check brake lines and for tire rub on suspension or body parts.

, The lifting of a vehicle will change the suspension geometry and proper alignment is essential for safe operation and good tire wear.

, Have fun but be safe and tread lightly to protect the environment so trails will remain open and Jeepers will keep their good name.

Clean your wheels with soap and water.,
Clean your wheels with a wax and grease remover.,
Sand your wheels.,
Spray the wheels with water.,
Dry the wheels.",How to Paint Your Wheels2," This first step will remove most dirt and grime from your wheels. This will allow you to recognize any dents, chips, or rust on your wheels. It will also make sanding easier and more efficient., A wax and grease remover is typically just a nonpolar solvent like mineral spirits (unlike water, which is a polar solvent). This will dissolve things that water will not, such as oils. It’s a good way to clean what your soapy water may have missed., At the very least, you will need a wire brush to remove all rust. Ideally, you would sandblast your wheels to remove rust and any old paint or stuck on debris. This will give you the best starting surface. Next, sand the entire wheel with 300 grit sandpaper and then 500 grit sandpaper. This will remove any coarse scratches and leave only a smooth surface with very fine scratches that the paint can adhere to and cover.When you are finished sanding, you should be able to run your fingers over the wheel and feel a smooth even surface. There should be no rough patches or pits in the wheel.

, You want to spray off any debris from sanding. Remove as much dust as you possibly can. This will help ensure a clean paint job.If you do not have a water hose, you can dump water over the wheels with a bucket.

, Use compressed air to get to any cracks or crevices that you cannot reach. Make sure that all water (and the dust in it) is wiped away. Again, we want the wheels absolutely clean for priming and painting.You can also dry with a chamois cloth, but be sure to leave no water on the surface at all.

"
"
Choose a place to paint.,
Wear protective gear.,
Put tape around the perimeter of your paint surface.,
Cover the entire wheel in plastic or paper wrap.,
Cut the plastic with a razor.",How to Paint Your Wheels3," The ideal location will be as dust free as possible. You should also consider spraying down the floor and/or walls to reduce the chance of stirring up dust. Good ventilation is a must. It helps remove dust and other contaminants and also removes the excess paint and thinner from the room.

, This will protect yourself from toxic materials in the paint, as well as protect your paint job from anything falling off of your body. Having your head and body covered minimizes the risk of a hair or piece of lint falling onto the paint surface. At the very least, a mask/respirator is a must for safety.


Paints and paint thinners (also known as reducers) contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs are flammable and toxic. They are dangerous to inhale and are also absorbed through the skin and eyes., The tape should outline the part of the rim you wish to paint without touching it. The part of the wheel that you want to paint should not have any tape on it. This can be a slow and tedious process depending on the design of your wheel and whether or not you opted to remove your tires and valve stem., This will be the primary protection from overspray. By blocking the excess paint from landing on other surfaces of the wheel, you save yourself a lot of time trying to clean it off later. Any overspray that does end up in unwanted places will have to be carefully removed with lubricant and a clay bar., Trim out the center of the plastic. This will expose the section of the wheel you wish to paint. Tape the outside of the circle you made (the cut edges of the plastic) and down to the first layer of tape that you laid. Tape the rest of the plastic edges down as well. This will seal off any entrance for overspray to get on the rest of your wheel."
"
Wipe the paint surface down with wax and grease remover.,
Prime the wheels.,
Inspect your wheels.,
Paint your wheels.,
Spray your clear coat.",How to Paint Your Wheels4," You need a final wipe to remove any excess dirt or dust from the wheels. The wax and grease remover also removes any oils left from your hands or skin while working with the wheel. Use a clean paper towel to wipe the surface dry instead of letting the cleaner evaporate., The primer provides the ideal surface for your paint to adhere and helps in rust prevention. It also provides an even color across the paint surface and allows the paint to look the same across your wheel. You will need to spray on two to three coats of primer. Read the instructions on your primer and wait the recommended amount of time in between coats. This will help prevent running.You will need a self etching primer at the very least. This will protect the metal from rusting. Depending on the quality of paint job you want, there are also primers that are specifically formulated to go with certain paints. Talk to your parts/paint dealer about which primer you should use.

, After priming you will be able to see any blemishes that you may have missed when getting the wheel to this point. If you see any, you will have to sand down the primer, fix the imperfection, and prime again. This is your last opportunity to make your wheels perfect before the paint goes on.Paint goes on in very thin coats. While some very minor imperfections may be overlooked, paint does not hide imperfections well.

, As with the primer, the paint will need to be applied in several (usually three) even coats. You should allow the paint to sit for the recommended time before applying the next coat. Spray back and forth across the paint surface at an even pace. Do not get too close to the surface or move too slowly or else you’ll run your paint. If you move too quickly, you won’t get good coverage.

, This is only necessary if you are using a base coat/clear coat paint. If your paint is single stage, you can skip this step. Clear coat will be a applied the same way as paint and primer - three even coats with time in between. Allow the paint job to sit for 24 hours before buffing or reinstalling your wheels.Be warned that clear coat runs easier than base coat or primer.

Sand any dirt spots.,
Buff the scratches.,
Peel off any tape, plastic or paper remaining.,
Polish your wheel.",How to Paint Your Wheels5," Dirt spots look like dust in your paint job (which is exactly what they are). Sand them out with a very mild sandpaper like 2000 grit. If you want to make the buffing process easier, you can go back over these sand scratches with an even finer 3000 grit sandpaper.

, It is not necessary to use the buffing compound on the entire paint job (unless it looks dull). You do need to use the compound, which is usually the first step in a multi-step buffing system, on any areas that you sanded. Buff lightly until you cannot see the sandpaper scratches any more.Be aware that moving the buffer too slowly, getting it caught in a corner, or buffing at too high a speed can result in burning or peeling off the paint.
Clean off excess buffing solution with a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol.

, Now that you are done painting and buffing, you have no need for keeping the wheels masked.When you unmask the wheel, check for any overspray that might have gotten on you wheel. If there is any, use a clay bar and lubricant to remove it., The polish will often come as a second step in a buffing system. Sometimes there is even a third step that promotes shine even further. Apply the polish with a buffer on low speeds with a soft foam pad and then wipe it away with a clean microfiber cloth.


Do not use traditional wax or silicon on fresh paint. If you seal the paint it will not properly vent and this will cause bubbling and or cloudiness in your paint job."

Use a lug wrench to remove lug nuts.,
Begin loosening the lug nuts while the car is still on the ground.,
Place the lug wrench on a lug nut and turn it counter-clockwise.,
Continue loosening the bolts.",How to Loosen Lug Nuts1,";
, Depending on your vehicle, the hubcap may need to be removed before you're able to access the lug nuts and loosen them. Hubcaps are usually either attached by metal clips, held on by the lug nuts themselves, or using plastic lugs.








If your hubcaps clip on, pry them off using the flat end of the tire iron or a flathead screwdriver against a thick or solid part of the hubcap.
If your hubcaps are held on by the lug nuts, you'll only be able to remove them after you've removed the lug nuts entirely. If you try to remove them before doing so, you'll break them.
If your hubcaps screw on using plastic lugs, you'll need to remove these with a lug wrench (and avoid excessive force when reinstalling them to avoid breakage).

, The wheels of cars, trucks, and other vehicles will be affixed to the axle with between four and eight lug nuts, used to center the wheel and secure it onto the vehicle. Some European cars will have lug bolts instead of nuts, though the removal process should be exactly the same.


On some cars, locking lugs are used to keep the wheels from being stolen. This is usually only necessary for one lug nut per wheel, and it should look different than the others. These require a special key to unlock require the use of a key to loosen the lock on the end of the lug nut.
On some locking lug nuts you can hammer on a ⅞ 12 point socket and remove the locking lug bolt instead of using the special key. The hardest part is that you also need a vice to put the socket in to hit the locking lug nut off with a punch.

, A lug wrench, sometimes called a tire iron, tire tool, or a t-bar, should be provided in your vehicle's tire kit, along with a jack and a spare tire. Lug wrenches should fit the lug nuts used on your wheel assembly perfectly, and in most cases you shouldn't need other tools to remove them.


Lug wrenches can be either a straight bar or two crossed bars, which is sometimes called a “spider wrench.” The crossed bars give you extra strength, because you can grab onto either side with your hands and twist with all your arm strength.
If your lug nuts are stuck on because of rust, over-tightening, or some other factor, read the next section for tips on loosening especially tenacious lug nuts.

, Don't jack up the car before you attempt to loosen lug nuts. Instead, use the resistance created by the tire's contact with the ground to help you loosen the nuts. They won't spin if they're on the ground, which means you'll be able to remove them much more easily.

, Turn the wrench after you've secured it onto one of the nuts, pulling hard until you feel the lug nut begin to loosen. You don't need to remove the lug nut entirely, just use the wrench to loosen it until it's loose enough to remove with your fingers.








, It doesn't matter which nut you loosen first. Pick one, then continue moving around the bolts in a ""star"" pattern, skipping the lug nut adjacent to the one you just loosened. This pattern helps keep the wheel centered and is more important when you're installing the wheel. Still, it's a good habit to get into when you're loosening the bolts as well.









When all the bolts are loose, it's time to jack the car up, remove the lug nuts entirely, spinning them off by hand, and then remove the wheel to complete whatever project you've planned. If your project requires mores than just immediately replacing the the wheel with the spare or a new wheel, you should put a frame stand under the car until the project is complete.

Do not use excessive amounts of starting fluid.,
Check to make sure you can use starting fluid with your vehicle.,
Choose a quality starting fluid.",How to Use Starting Fluid1," Starting fluid is highly flammable and combustible. Store and handle them safely. For instance, do not place your can of starting fluid on a hot engine or spray it near a hot engine., Too much starting fluid can damage your engine. Consult your vehicle user’s manual and the user directions appended to the starting fluid in order to determine the appropriate volume of starting fluid for your vehicle.Typically, a couple of short bursts of starting fluid should be adequate to get your engine started.

, Starting fluid cannot be used with all vehicles. For instance, if your vehicle is equipped with glow plugs, or if your vehicle uses diesel fuel, you will not be able to utilize starting fluid.Check your vehicle’s user guide to ensure starting fluid is appropriate for use with your vehicle.Starting fluid also cannot be used in two-stroke engines, such as those in lawnmowers.If starting fluid is not appropriate for your vehicle, try an alternative like carburetor cleaner., Only use trusted brands when selecting a starting fluid.

Check your oil.,
Use a fluorescent leak detection system.,
Consider ""steam cleaning"" your engine to make it easier to spot oil leaks.,
Apply a thin coating of talcum powder around the engine.,
Look for multiple leaks.",How to Troubleshoot Leaking Oil," Take out the dipstick, which will be red, orange, or yellow. You should not need to remove the oil cap itself to check the dipstick. Wipe off any oil with a rag or paper towel so you can see the mark that indicates the proper oil level. ""Dip"" the stick into the oil reservoir and then take it back out. Look to see if the oil on the stick reaches the oil level mark.


It is ideal to check your oil once a week.
Add oil if the crankcase is low or empty. Continue checking every 30 minutes. Rapidly leaking oil could mean there is a hole in your oil pan.;
, The combination of an ultraviolet (UV) or blue light and fluorescent dyes allows you to find small oil leaks. Add the dye to your oil reservoir and let your engine idle for 10 minutes. With the overhead lights off, shine the fluorescent light over your engine. Glowing areas indicate leaks.

, Wrap packing cellophane around the connectors, sensors and wiring harnesses and secure with duct tape. Spray degreaser on your engine, chassis and suspension and let sit for the time specified in the instructions. Using a steam cleaner, eliminate any grease or hardened dirt. Dry electrical components and sensors with compressed air.

, Drive your car for about 15 minutes. If there is oil on the surface, it will appear in the powder, allowing you to see its point of origin.

, Multiple oil leaks can be present due to natural wear of the seals used to retain the oil. It is not uncommon for valve cover gaskets, cam seals, and oil pan gaskets leak at the same time. All the rubber seals that retain fluid on an engine are exposed to the same heating and cooling of the engine, and may fail one at a time or all together.

Double check that the parking brake is on.,
Get additional leverage.,
Use your foot.,
Use a mallet or hammer.,
Use a penetrating oil if the lug nuts are rusted to the stud.,
Use a wheel lock remover to remove locked lugs.,
Use a torque wrench when replacing lug nuts.",How to Loosen Lug Nuts2," If your lug nuts are stuck, you'll need to exert extra force to remove them. Before you do that, you want to make sure that your car isn't going anywhere. Make sure you're on a flat surface and that your parking brake is engaged before attempting to wrangle with tenacious stuck-on lug nuts.

, Factory lug wrenches usually have short handles that don't provide much leverage. The first and safest thing you should do is get the physics of leverage on your side. If the handle of the wrench you're using is longer, it'll be much easier to loosen the nut.


Increase your leverage by using a ""breaker bar."" These are typically longer and stronger than the lug wrenches that come with most cars.
If the breaker bar alone is insufficient, find a length of pipe that you can fit over the handle of the wrench or breaker bar so that you are able to turn from farther away from the nut. You should be able to use your hands. When choosing a pipe, the closer to the size of the handle, the better.

, If you're stuck with nothing else to use and your arms are not strong enough to loosen the lug nut, you can use your stronger leg muscles to get the loosening process started. Be careful, though, if you must do this.









Attach the lug wrench to the nut securely, and arrange the handle at an angle nearly parallel to the ground. Carefully, use one foot to press down on the lug wrench, turning it counter-clockwise. Use your leg and push hard. Brace yourself against the car and stand on the wrench, bouncing gently, if necessary. When it loosens, stop and use the wrench as normal.
Be extremely careful if you're going to try to do this. It's not a trampoline. Don't stomp your foot onto the wrench or jump up and down. Keep your foot in contact with the wrench at all times and let your weight do the work.

, If you don't have access to any pipe to extend the length of the handle, it might be time to get primitive. Using a rubber mallet or a hammer to pound on the handle of the lug wrench can be an effective way of loosening particularly stuck-on lug nuts in an emergency. If you're stuck on the side of the highway, it might be your only option. If you're without a hammer at all, a rock or another heavy object could also work.









Be extremely careful to avoid glancing blows if you're going to try to hammer at the bar of the lug wrench. Use short, controlled strikes with the mallet and stop after a few to see if you've loosened it enough to use another method.

, (Use this only as a last resort.) If you're struggling against more than over-tightening, it might be helpful to spray a small to moderate amount of penetrating oil such as PB Blaster or Liquid Wrench directly on the stud threads where they disappear inside the lug nut. Use the thin straw like tube that came with the penetrating oil to apply the penetrant accurately and try to avoid overspray which may get on the brake drum or rotor. Let the penetrant sit for about ten minutes to work its way across the threads and loosen things up a bit.









If the lug nut is still stubborn, try one more spritz of a light, directed spray to the surface of the threaded stud exactly where the threads start to disappear inside the lug nut. Let this sit for another ten minutes and check the results. The solid impact of moderate taps by a mallet on the lug wrench may now have an effect.
Be sure that your brake discs and drums are free from oil before driving the car again. Oil on these surfaces is a serious safety hazard as it may lead to brake failure, increased stopping distances, and accidents. Clean the metal brake surfaces of the rotor or drum with a clean cloth and suitable solvent such as acetone. If you have saturated the brake pads with penetrating oil, it is best to replace the pads or consult a certified mechanic.
If you have gotten oil on the brake surfaces, test the brakes at low speed and in the absence of traffic to gauge the stopping power. Test at higher and higher speeds until you are comfortable with the results. Remember to give other drivers of the vehicle a heads up that the car may not stop as quickly as in the past and have them test the new braking capabilities too.

, If you've lost the key to your locked lugs, you may be able to remove them with a special socket head designed to remove locks. Featuring reverse threads, these heads are great for biting into the lock and loosening it without the need for the key to remove it. These heads are also great for removing rounded-off lug nuts that might be difficult to remove. These are available online and at most auto parts stores.









To use a wheel lock remover, snap it onto the end of your socket wrench and lock it into place. Use the breaker bar to turn the locked lug counter-clockwise as normal. It should come loose with some effort.

, If you struggled to get your lug nuts off because of over-tightening on the previous tire-change, take care to tighten them to the proper specifications this time by using a torque wrench.Check your owner’s manual to see what the recommended torque is for your tires, then set your torque wrench to the proper specifications on the side of the wrench, then lock it into place with the locking collar. Additionally, tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern. Do it twice to make sure all the lug nets are tight.

Take your vehicle to a mechanic if it doesn’t start.",How to Use Starting Fluid2," Air intakes are devices on all vehicles that allow the engine to mix air with fuel, thus making combustion possible. While the air intake will always be attached to the engine housed beneath the hood, different manufacturers produce their vehicles to different specifications, and so air intakes are located in different locations on different vehicles. Consult your vehicle’s user guide to identify the location of your air intake.Air intakes often look like metal tubes. They might be powder-coated or painted in the same color as the vehicle.

, Keep the can of starting fluid upright. Aim the can’s nozzle at the air intake from about 12 inches (20 centimeters) away. Spray the starting fluid for about two seconds, then try to turn the engine over. If the engine still doesn’t turn over, spray another two-second blast.You many need to remove the filter covering your air intake to do this., If the engine won’t start even with an appropriate application of starting fluid, the engine itself might not be the problem.

If it was open when you try to turn the vehicle over, close it.Adjusting the choke is also a good idea when your car has a carburetor and starts, but then turns off.
If you cannot locate your choke, consult your vehicle’s user manual.

, If your car has a hard time starting on rainy days, look inside the distributor cap. If you see moisture inside the distributor cap, turn the cap upside down and spray it with mechanic’s solvent (or, if you have a bottle of solvent rather than a spray can, pour some of the solvent into the cap). Swish the solvent around, then pour it out. Use a clean rag to wipe out any additional solvent before replacing the cap.The distributor cap is a small cover that protects your car’s distributor.

, You are attempting to drain the fuel tank. All fuel tanks have at least two fuel lines attached.


One pipe sucks fuel from the bottom of the tank, the other is the return pipe it returns unused fuel from the engine. All modern automobile engines have fuel pumps to suck fuel up to the engine.
You need to determine whether your engine uses a mechanical or electrical fuel pump. Mechanical fuel pumps are bolted onto the engine block or cylinder head.

Electrical pumps can be located anywhere but are mostly submersed in the fuel at the bottom of the fuel tank.
If you take the cover off the fuses usually located under the steering wheel and look at the sticker and see any reference to a fuse for the fuel pump then you have an electric fuel pump.

,


It is connected to the fuel filter that may be visible. Since all modern cars have anti-siphon devices fitted underneath the filler cap of the fuel tank you will use the cars fuel pump to drain the unsuitable fuel.
Mechanical fuel pumps only function when the engine is turning over. It is not advisable to turn the engine over as the battery would be well flat before the tank would be drained out the fuel line.
If the car has an electrical fuel pump you may be able to short circuit a wire from the horn or hazard warning or blower circuit into the electric fuel pump circuit after removing two fuses.
The pump will then empty our the fuel line and into a seven up or cocoa cola bottle which you will fit over the end of the line.
If this does not work then fill a bottle with petrol and make a hole with the thinnest needle you can find near the bottom. Have a comrade crank the engine while you let the stream of petrol that leaks out the hole over the carburetor.
When the engine starts and runs on the fine stream stop cranking. The engine will proceed to run and power the fuel pump thus draining the tank. Obviously on engines with a mechanical pump the line would have to be disconnected on the side not hooked to the filter or the pump could not do its job.

,, Let the starter cool after each session for perhaps two to three minutes. When the engine starts and warms up there may be a slight miss until the last vestige of contaminated fuel in the newly mixed tank is expended.

Before proceeding, make sure that the vehicle is in park with the parking brake activated. Though the risk of a free-rolling vehicle is almost insignificant for this procedure, it's better to be safe than sorry.
For manual transmission vehicles, put the car in first gear and apply the parking brake.;
,









After turning off the vehicle, pop the hood and locate the brake fluid reservoir. This is usually small, pale in color (with a dark-colored cap) and mounted in the top driver's side corner of the engine bay.
The brake fluid reservoir is attached to the brake master cylinder — from the outside, this looks like a small metal block or tube near the back of the engine.
Note that most brake fluid reservoirs will have instructions printed on top of the cap. When it comes to refilling your brake fluid, defer to these instructions. This article is written for generalized cases and may not be perfectly accurate for every vehicle, but your manufacturer's instructions should be accurate for yours.

,









Ensure that additional fluid is needed before proceeding — most brake fluid reservoirs should have marked ""minimum"" and ""maximum"" lines.
Some newer vehicles are built so that the brake fluid level can be monitored while the reservoir remains sealed. In this case, you only need to read the fluid level marks on the outside of the tank.

,









If the brake fluid is lower than the indicated ""min"" or ""add"" line, it's time to add additional fluid. You may also want to have your brakes checked — a drop in brake fluid level can be a sign of problems with the brake system as a whole, like worn pads.Another detail to look for is the color of the fluid. When brake fluid is fresh, it's clear with a yellowish tint. With use, brake fluid can gradually grow darker as it accumulates impurities. If your brake fluid is brown or black, simply adding new fluid is not enough — you'll need to drain the old fluid and replace it.This is a good sign that it is time to have the brake fluid system flushed, you should add fluid as needed to bring the system up to the full level.
If there's enough brake fluid in the reservoir and it's not discolored, you may not need to do anything unless your vehicle is scheduled for maintenance. In this case, simply record the date of your inspection for future reference.

Read your vehicle's owner's manual to learn how to maintain your vehicle and what gasoline to use. Most vehicles will call for regular octane gasoline, but some will perform better and have longer engine life if high octane gasoline is used.;
,


Talk to the mechanic that regularly works on your vehicle or a local mechanic that specializes in working on your type of car about which gasoline to purchase. Your mechanic will likely be familiar with which types of gasoline result in optimum performance in certain vehicles and will also be able to inform you about warning signs to watch for if the wrong gasoline is causing your car to malfunction.

,


Gas pumps now have diesel fuel and fuel for hybrid vehicles alongside standard gasoline, so be sure to purchase gasoline that is appropriate for your vehicle. Read the signs at the pump carefully and double check that you've chosen fuel that is safe for your vehicle before you start pumping.

,


The first step to knowing which gasoline to purchase is to understand the differences between the available kinds of gasoline. Research octane levels in regular versus high octane gasoline and educate yourself about the benefits of different types of gasoline for specific vehicles or driving patterns.

,


High octane or premium gasoline can be worth the extra cost at the pump if you drive long distances on a regular basis, but might not be worth the expense if your driving habits don't warrant it. Log your regular drive times and distances and determine whether your driving habits and routes warrant purchasing premium gasoline.

,


Ask a local car dealer or customer representative for your vehicle's make about the best kinds of gasoline to purchase. The individuals that sell your type of vehicle will have more knowledge about the specific needs of your type of car along with feedback from other drivers.

,


Take the age and condition of your car into consideration when purchasing gasoline. An older car with an older engine might run more smoothly with premium gasoline, whereas a newer car with fewer maintenance needs or problems could be fine with cheaper gasoline.

,


Do this immediately after the sugar is gone from the mixture. Not doing so could allow materials to develop that could ruin your engine.






Put the mixture into a reflux still.






Follow the manufacturer's instructions to complete the distillation process.







,

The ethanol that you are left with after the distillation process will still have a minor impurity of water inside of it. To remove this water, you need to use a specialized fuel filter that can filter the water out. These filters are made out of specially-designed fabrics that allow ethanol molecules to pass through while trapping the water.







,

Depending on your engine type and regulations that apply to ethanol production in your area, add the required amount of gasoline (petrol) to the mixture. A fuel that is commonly produced is E85, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline (petrol).

Use an appropriate brake fluid.,
Wipe the reservoir and its cap with a clean, dry rag.,
Remove the reservoir cap and add the brake fluid.",How to Refill Brake Fluid2,"









Check your vehicle's owner's manual to see if there are any specific instructions for the type of brake fluid you should use. Also, the cap usually states what kind of brake fluid is required. For the vast majority of vehicles, a standard glycol-based DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid should be used.
Some brake systems may require DOT 5 fluid, which, because it's silicone-based, has a different chemical composition than DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids. Conventional vehicle maintenance wisdom dictates that DOT 5 should never be mixed with DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid or used in systems intended for these types of fluids or it may damage the brakes.

,









Give the top of the reservoir a quick wipe with a lint-free cloth to remove any dirt or debris. This ensures that no loose particles are able to fall into the reservoir and also prevents the brake fluid from dripping onto you or other parts of the engine.
If at any point you get brake fluid on your hands, wash them. Brake fluid is corrosive enough to strip paint from metal, so it's dangerous to leave on your skin for very long.When you're done, re-seal the cap and close the hood. Congratulations! You're done.

,









The actual act of adding extra brake fluid to your vehicle's reservoir is quite easy — simply pour it through the reservoir hole carefully. Use the minimum and maximum fill lines as a guide, if present. If your reservoir doesn't have these markings, fill it about 2/3 to 3/4 full.
You may want to consider using a clean funnel to help prevent spillage. If you do this, however, be sure to clean it using soap and water after use, as brake fluid can be highly caustic.

Make sure to clean up any spills.",How to Refill Brake Fluid3,"


Draining old brake fluid and replacing it is a substantially more complicated task than simply adding extra fluid. It's also a task with more potential for error. For these reasons, you'll want to consult your vehicle's owner's manual before you get started. This guide may not apply to every vehicle, so it's important to double-check with your manufacturer's instructions to ensure you don't inadvertently do any damage to your vehicle.
Note that this is a two-person job, so you'll also want to grab a partner before beginning.

,









To start, you'll want to raise the vehicle on frame stands. Remove each wheel just as you would if you were replacing the vehicle's tires.
A level working surface and secure supports are essential here — since the vehicle is raised off of the ground, slippage is a rare but potentially deadly possibility.

,









Open the hood and locate the reservoir as normal. Add extra fluid to the reservoir as normal — even if the fluid that's already in the reservoir is discolored.
When you're done, replace the lid. In the next few steps, you'll be getting into and out of the car repeatedly, sometimes adding more new fluid to the reservoir. As you do this, remember not to remove the reservoir cap while the vehicle's brake pedal is depressed, as this will cause the fluid to gush out.

,









On each brake caliper, you should see a small bleed valve on the back side. This usually looks like a bolt with a small nipple on it and sometimes has a rubber protective cap.In the next few steps, you'll use the bleed valves to let the old, spent brake fluid out of the vehicle's brake lines. Typically, this is done by starting with the rear wheel on the opposite side as the brake fluid reservoir and proceeding through the rest of the wheels in reverse order of their nearness to the reservoir. However, many vehicles require an alternate order to be used, so be sure to double-check with your owner's manual.

,








This is a somewhat complicated process — see the link in the step title for a detailed guide.
Begin by connecting the bleed valve to a clear plastic ""catcher"" container (like an empty soda bottle) with tubing. Ideally, this should be hung or held above the caliper to prevent air from entering the brake system through the valve. Loosen the valve very slightly — not enough for brake fluid to flow, but enough for it to be easy to loosen it the rest of the way.
Have an assistant pump the vehicle's brakes a few times until s/he notices pressure or resistance from the brake pedal (the vehicle's engine should be off at this point). Once s/he notices pressure, loosen the bleed valve until fluid begins passing through the tube. The assistant should notice the brake pedal move towards the floor.
Be sure to stop bleeding fluid before the pedal reaches the floor — your assistant should shout to let you know when the pedal is about 2/3 of the way to the floor. Letting the pedal reach the floor can damage the brakes.

,









You never want to let the fluid drop so low that you can no longer see it, as this can introduce air into the brake system. Check the brake fluid reservoir after each bleeding. If necessary, add fresh fluid back to the fill line.
Repeat the bleeding procedures above, refilling the fluid in the reservoir as you go, until the fluid passing through the valve is clear and free of air bubbles. Close the bleed screw when finished and make sure it is tight.

,









Once you've bled the first wheel as directed above, move on to the rest. As noted previously, the typical order for bleeding a vehicle's brakes is to start with the rear wheel furthest away from the brake fluid reservoir and proceed through the other wheels in reverse order of closeness, ending with the front wheel closest to the reservoir. However, this order may be different for some vehicles, so check the owner's manual.
As one final precaution, observe the fluid level in the reservoir as your assistant depresses the pedal and then abruptly releases the pressure. If the pedal feels spongy, there may still be air bubbles in the brake system, so you'll need to continue bleeding.When you've finished with the last wheel and no air bubbles remain in the brake lines, refill the brake fluid reservoir to the fill line and re-cap it.

,









Use a lint-free cloth to wipe up any brake fluid that may have dripped or spilled around the reservoir, taking care not to wipe any debris into the open reservoir itself.
Double-check to ensure that the cap is properly tightened and that the rubber gasket is seated properly before closing the hood and operating the vehicle. Replace the wheels and carefully lower the vehicle back to the ground.
Congratulations! You've just replaced your vehicle's brake fluid and bled its brakes — not an easy task for beginners.

,


If brake fluid spills onto the ground, don't forget to clean it up — not only is it a corrosive, somewhat noxious fluid, but also a hazard in terms of slippage.
Minor spills can usually be cleaned up with a wet towel or mop. For major spills, absorb the fluid with inert, non-flammable materials like sand, dirt, diatomaceous earth, etc. and shovel this into a waste receptacle.Don't let brake fluid make its way into a storm drain or use brake fluid-soaked dirt etc. be used for purposes like gardening — brake fluid is toxic and can pose an environmental hazard if it's released into the environment without being properly processed and treated.

Prepare your car before trying to remove the gum.,
Clean the spot around the gum.,
Try body solvent.,
Spray the gum with bug and tar remover.,
Purchase a commercial product designed to remove grime.,
Purchase gum remover.,
Try a can of compressed air.,
Use ice to harden the gum.,
Use peanut butter.",How to Remove Chewing Gum from a Car Exterior," It’s very important that you not rub, scrub or scrape too hard or you might scratch the car exterior. However, you should still do some prepping of the car.


Pull as much of the gum off as you can before applying any products to it.Move the car into a shaded area so that the gum doesn’t melt while you’re working on it.;
, It might be a good idea to wipe the area of the car where the gum is stuck to remove any obvious dirt.


All you need is a bucket full of hot water and dish soap. You just need a squirt of dish soap in two cups of water. Dip a cloth into the bucket, and wet it. Then, gently wipe away any easily removable residue from the car’s exterior.You want to avoid using anything too abrasive. It’s best to use a soft cloth when rubbing on a car exterior.
You will want to repeat this process after you remove the gum too to get rid of any lingering residue. After removing the gum, you may need to apply a new coat of protective wax.
If the water is hot enough, it may be possible to remove the gum using only soap and water.

, Take a cotton ball, soak it in body solvent, and let it sit on the gum for about a minute to soften it up. Then, take a soft cloth with body solvent on it. Wipe it off.


You may need to repeat the process a second time if it doesn’t all come off.Body solvents are specifically designed to be used on paint, so they are a good choice for cleaning a car exterior without damage.
You can also try this with rubbing alcohol.

, If you wet the gum with bug remover and tar remover, it should come right off the car. You might need to wax the car after you use this, though, as it can remove some of the wax.


The good thing about bug and tar remover is that it’s designed specifically not to harm a car exterior because people usually use it to get rid of bugs that have flown into the car’s outside or tar that’s ended up on the vehicle. You could also apply the bug and tar remover to the gum by using a soft cloth. Rub the remover into the gum, until it starts to come off.

, Goo Gone is one product that is widely used to remove gum from car exteriors. Goof Off also has a product that can be used on car paint.Goo Gone advertises that its product is safe for use on a car exterior if you follow the instructions for hard surfaces.To use either product, apply the product and wait three to five minutes. Pull the gum off. Use a clean cloth to wipe off excess gum.Wear safety goggles and solvent-resistant gloves when working with chemicals.

, Believe it or not, there is a product designed to remove gum. It’s often used by industrial cleaners, so look for it in such a store.


Spray the remover on the gum, and then remove the gum from the car.
Some people also use WD-40 oil to remove gum, bugs, and other grime from a car exterior., Spraying compressed air on the gum ma harden it enough for you to remove the wad. This method is usually very effective.


You can find these cans in most hardware stores.
Usually, people use compressed air to clean other things, such as removing residue caught inside a computer keyboard. However, they work on a car exterior too.

, You might be able to peel the gum off the car exterior if you harden it. You can do this with ice cubes.


Take a small towel and wrap the ice cubes in it. Hold it on the gum for about five minutes. Once you remove it, the gum should be hard.
Try to gently peel off the hard gum. You may need to repeat the process. You could also put the ice cube in a Ziploc bag. Wrapping it will keep it from dripping too much once it starts to melt.

, The oil in the peanut butter can help remove the gum from your car. It’s not designed to clean your car, but some people still use it, and they say it can work.Smear the peanut butter on the gum. Let it sit for three minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp rag. Peanut butter causes the chewing gum to lose its stickiness, and it becomes easier to pick out.
You could also try putting body oil on the gum with the same principle in mind. Some people have also tried using eucalyptus oil with some success.

Pull up to the pump and turn off your car.,
Select your payment method and pay for your gas.,
Remove the gas cap from your vehicle.,
Remove the nozzle and insert it securely into the gas tank opening.,
Select an appropriate grade of gasoline.,
Make your selection by pressing the corresponding button on the pump.,
Press start.,
Pull the trigger on the pump to activate the gasoline.,
Consider cutting off the gas before completely filling the tank.,
Remove and replace the nozzle.,
Recap your gas tank.,
Accept or reject a receipt.",How to Pump Your Own Gas," Pull up with your gas tank opening as close as possible to the pump. Make sure you pull up on the right side. Since it's dangerous to pump gas with your car running, you need to turn off the ignition and get out of the car.









Make sure you're at the correct variety of pump. Some pumps are designated for Diesel vehicles only, while some pump regular gas only, and some pump both. Pumps that pump both kinds of gas will have two nozzles on each side.
Practice good pump safety. Before you pull up to the pump, put out any cigarettes that might cause a fire hazard around the gas and leave your cellphone in the car. Cell static has been linked to several gas station flare-ups.;
, You've got to pay for the gas before you select your variety of gas and pump it. You can pay with a credit or debit card directly at the pump, or with your card or cash at the counter inside.



To pay at the pump, just slide your card to get started and follow the instructions. You'll likely have to select between debit/credit, and enter your PIN number or your zip code to confirm payment. Some machines will prompt you to enter an amount. If you enter $20, the pump will cut off the gas when you've pumped $20 worth. If you want to fill your tank, just press enter to skip this step.

To pre-pay inside, pay the attendant. You'll need to tell them how much gas you want to pay for, and the number of the pump at which you're parked. You can use either a card or cash. The cash amount you pay them will show up on the pump, which will cut off when you get to that amount. If you want to fill up your tank and pay in cash, you'll probably have to overpay, then pump your gas, and then return to the counter to get your change. This is common. Just tell the attendant you're going to try to fill it up, pay more than you think you'll need to pay, and go back to the counter for your change.

, To access the gas tank, you'll probably need to pop the door to the gas tank. Depending on your model, you might have to press a button inside to pop it, or just open it with your fingers and expose the gas cap. Unscrew the gas cap and set it somewhere safe, or let it hang if connected with a wire.








, On most machines, you need to remove the nozzle before the machine will allow you to select a variety of gas and start pumping. The safest way to do this is to remove the nozzle and immediately insert the nozzle into the gas port of your car, pushing it in until it sits snugly.









If you see two nozzles at the gas pump, that means the pump supplies both diesel and regular. The Diesel nozzle is usually slightly larger and colored green, and the nozzle is usually too big to put into the port of a regular gas tank. Make sure you select the correct variety for your car--using the wrong kind of gas can ruin your engine.
Pump nozzles are made to fit into your gas tank without you holding onto the handle while you pump. While you'll likely see lots of people holding onto the pump the whole time, this is unnecessary. Just make sure you've inserted it in fully and snugly and it should be fine.

, On most gas pumps, you'll be able to select between three grades of gasoline, based on their octane rating: regular (87), mid-grade (89), and premium gas (91-93). Depending on the branding of the gas station these grades may have different names, but the octane rating is mostly universal. To determine the most-appropriate octane for your vehicle, consult the owner's manual of your vehicle. For most vehicles, regular or mid-grade gasoline is perfectly appropriate and even preferable.


The octane rating refers to the amount of gasoline that can be compressed during the compression stroke before the gas is ignited. Lower-octane gas will ignite earlier, and higher-octane will ignite later in the stroke. Higher-octane gasoline is traditionally used in high-performance engines to prevent knocking and create horsepower. Most vehicles won't benefit from high-octane fuel.

, Each grade of gas will have a button you can press to select it. When you've made your decision based on octane-grade and price, select the variety of gas you'd like to use and


On some older machines, there's a little seat on the bottom of the ""holster"" where the gas pump sits in the machine. Before you select a variety of gas and start pumping, you've got to flip it up. On newer digital machines, you're just doing this by pressing a button. Once you've activated the pump, you're ready to pick your gas and start pumping.

, After selecting the variety of gas you want to pump, you'll probably need to press the ""Start"" button on most pumps. This will activate the gas and prime the pump, which means you'll be ready to start pumping your gas whenever you're ready.


Look at the dial on the pump to make sure it goes back to zero. This will indicate that the pump is ready to go, once you've made your selection. As you pump, you can watch to see how much volume of gas is being added and the price.

, Squeeze the trigger on the pump nozzle gently, allowing gasoline to flow out of the hose and into your fuel tank. On most pumps, you can lock the trigger to let the gas flow continuously and make it easier on your hand.









All modern pumps now have self-stopping mechanisms that will cut off the flow of gasoline when the tank becomes full, or when you've reached the amount for which you've pre-paid, whichever happens first. You'll hear a click when the tank is full, or when the machine cuts it off.

, There's some debate about the accuracy of the cut-off mechanism on some pumps. Some consumers believe that if you fill the tank to full, you're actually paying for more gas that flows back into the pump, unused. To avoid waste, keep your tank somewhere less than completely full.


It's true that some stations have vapor recovery systems that feed back into the pump, used to recover gasoline, and also that gasoline expands some in the tank, making a super-full tank somewhat unnecessary and wasteful, both financially and environmentally., Let the trigger return to its starting place and remove the nozzle from the tank, letting any last drips fall in. Return the holster tab to the ""down"" position, if you raised it, and replace the nozzle into the pump.









It's common for a small amount of gas to drip out of the nozzle as you remove it, so be careful to avoid getting it on your shoes and clothes. If you should spill any on the side of your car, or around the gas port, there are usually paper towels available at the side of the pump that you can use to clean up the spilled gasoline. It shouldn't dangerous, but can cause an odor.

, Return the gas cap to its place and twist it closed until it clicks a few times, then close the door to the gas tank.








, At this point, the gas pump will probably be beeping. You can print a receipt to complete the transition, or press ""No"" to reject it. Depending on the gas station and your method of payment, you may need to return to the shop to retrieve your receipt, if you want it.

Measure out 6.8 fl. oz. (200 milliliters) of methanol. You can find methanol in gas tank antifreeze, available at hardware stores or auto part stores. Pour it in a blender.






Use a scale that will accurately measure out grams to weigh out 3.5 grams of lye. You can use Red Devil Lye Drain Cleaner (sodium hydroxide), but take the proper precautions because lye is poisonous. Drain cleaners that are chlorine-based (calcium hypochlorite) will not work.






With the lid off, turn your blender on its slowest setting, and begin slowly adding the lye to the methanol inside. This will create sodium methoxide, but take precaution that the mixture doesn't splatter all over.






It should take about two minutes for the lye to dissolve, so once it has, add 1.1 quart (1 liter) of vegetable oil.

Treat the stain right away.,
Combine a gentle soap with warm water.,
Use a towel or soft scrubber.,
Dry the spot thoroughly.",How to Remove Egg Stains from Car Paint1," If the stain is relatively fresh, it may be okay to use a mixture of soap and water to clean it. This method will likely be most useful within the first hour after the stain forms; after that, the egg white will dry and begin to etch into your topcoat of paint. Wet the stain with warm water to soften it before you begin manually cleaning., This is the solution you will be using to treat the stain. The gentler the soap, the better: ordinary car wash soap should be sufficient, or a regular-strength dish soap designed to cut grease. Hand soap won't do it. Harsher soaps contain astringent chemicals that can eat away at the paint and make the spot more noticeable. The warm water will help soften the stain and prepare it to be buffed out.


You can soak the soap and water mixture into a towel as you go, or prepare it in a spray bottle beforehand for ease of application.
Watch out for industrial cleaners. They can be extremely harsh on paint, and if you're not careful you could make the problem worse.

, Abrasive surfaces can damage your paint, especially if the job requires a lot of vigorous scrubbing. Find a microfiber towel or use the soft side of a kitchen sponge to go over the stain while leaving the paint unharmed.


While softer surfaces are less likely to damage your paint, it will take longer for them to work on the stain, increasing the total time of the process.

, Once the stain is gone, dry the area with a microfiber towel. Make sure all traces of egg are gone before drying--if not, the streaks that soften and run off will dry again, and you're back to square one. If possible, put the car up for the night somewhere enclosed to give it time to dry completely.

It’s important to determine what material your rims are made of so you can buy a cleaner designed for that type of wheel. If you are unsure what type of wheels your vehicle came with, refer to the owner’s manual for guidance.Steel wheels are often black and covered with hubcaps.
Aluminum alloy wheels are common types of rims and often appear grey or polished silver.
Chrome and aluminum wheels can withstand harsher detergents than the paint on steel wheels.;
, Once you have determined what type of wheels you have, choose an appropriate cleaner. Some cleaners are designed for use on any wheel application, while others are intended only for specific types of wheels.Chrome wheels are often best cleaned by a wheel cleaner designed specifically for chrome.
You can purchase wheel cleaner at most large retail and auto parts stores.

, There are wheel cleaners that are designed for use on both wheels and the tires as well. This option may make for a faster result, but often will not do as good of a job cleaning the wheel.Wheel and tire cleaners can remove grime from you wheels and restore the shine to your tires.
Avoid tire dressing and wheel cleaner combinations, as they can turn your tires brown as they fade.

, The first step to washing your rims is simply to rinse them thoroughly. Use a hose with a spray nozzle to remove any loose debris, dirt or grime from the wheels. Most wheel cleaners need to be applied to a wet surface.A power washer or professional car wash hose can remove a good deal of stuck on grime.
A regular hose is sufficient to rinse the wheels and prepare them for the cleaner.

, Spray on wheel cleaners offer the fastest and easiest way to getting road grime off of your wheels. Read the instructions on the particular brand of wheel cleaner that you chose. Follow the instructions as they lay out to apply the cleaner to the wheel. In most cases, you will need to spray an even layer of wheel cleaner onto the entire wheel.If you have a combination wheel and tire cleaner, you can spray your tires as well.
Be careful not to overspray the wheel cleaner onto the paint of the vehicle.
Be sure to spray the cleaner onto and around the lug nuts.

, Wheel cleaners are designed to use chemicals to break down the hard to remove dirt and grime from you wheels. Allow the cleaner to sit on the wheels for a minute or two before rinsing them. If you don’t have time to wait, scrub the wheel with a brush while the cleaner works.The longer you allow the cleaner to sit, the better it will do at removing road grime.
Do not allow the cleaner to sit long enough to dry on the wheel.

, Brake dust can be extremely difficult to remove from a wheel. After the cleaner has soaked in for a few minutes, use a brush that is designed to clean wheels to scrub any grime off of them that is stuck on and hard to remove.Do not use a tire brush on most wheels. The bristles on tire brushes are too stiff and could scratch the finish.
Medium-soft bristled brushes are the best choice for wheels.

, Once you have scrubbed the stuck on grime off of the wheels, use your hose again to rinse the cleaner off of them completely. Be sure to rinse any small areas thoroughly, such as the space around the lug nuts or gaps in the design of the rim. Once they are rinsed, look at the wheels and assess whether or not you will need to begin the process again.If the wheels are still dirty, you may need to begin the process again.
You may be able to wipe excess dirt off with a paper towel after you rinse.

, Wheel cleaner contains harsh detergents that can remove wax and clear coat from your paint. While you do not have to wash your car after washing the rims, it may be a good idea to ensure no wheel cleaner remains on the paint of the car.If you don’t have time to wash the car after the wheels, spray wheel wells with the hose as you rinse the wheels.

, If the wheels are not as clean as you’d like, the easiest way to produce a better result is to simply go through the process again. Re-apply the cleaner to the wheels and allow them to sit for a little bit longer this time, then rinse it off again.Scrub any areas you missed the first time with the cleaner on the wheels.

, Concentrated wheel cleaners can eat through more grime than most regular ones, but can also do more damage to paint if it comes into contact with it. Be careful when applying more concentrated wheel cleaners to your car, as they can damage the paint quickly.You can purchase concentrated wheel cleaners at most auto parts stores.
Concentrated wheel cleaners often cost quite a bit more than normal ones.

, Once the wheels are clean, allow them to dry. Then apply a light layer of carnauba wax to the wheel. Once dry, use a chamois cloth to buff the wax off of the wheel, leaving it shiny just as it would with the car’s paint.The wax will make removing grime and brake dust must easier when cleaning your rims again next time.
Carnauba wax max may take some time to apply and shouldn’t be done if you’re in a hurry.

, If your wheels have a significant amount of brake dust caked on them and traditional wheel cleaners aren’t penetrating deep enough, try using a cleaner designed specifically for brake dust. Spray the brake dust cleaner directly onto the areas the brake dust is stuck to the wheel, then scrub them with the brush.If brake dust is a serious issue with your vehicle, you can purchase reduced brake dust brake pads to limit the amount that may get stuck to your wheels.
Be careful not to allow the brake dust cleaner to touch the paint on the vehicle.

Assess the damage.,
Choose the appropriate sandpaper.,
Sand the spot.,
Polish the scratches.",How to Remove Egg Stains from Car Paint2," If the stain has had time to set up, soap and water may not work: sanding is your next best option. Make sure the area you're planning to sand is broad and flat and accessible enough to allow for a sanding motion. Wet the stain to prepare it.

, You should be sanding softly enough to spare your paint as much damage as possible. Pick a sandpaper with a higher grit (something in the 80-120 grit range) to avoid scratching the area further. High-grit sandpapers use a higher number of grains that are less coarse, making them perfect for smoothing and finishing jobs.Soak the sandpaper in water for a few hours (or overnight) to slightly soften the grit. Otherwise, the friction of the sandpaper is more likely to damage your car.
Cutting the sandpaper will create a smaller sanding surface, making you less likely to accidentally scrape other areas of paint.
Alternatively, a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser might do the trick. Its dense plastic surface works much like a fine, high-grit sandpaper, and it can be purchased in most supermarkets and convenience stores.

, Use small, gentle sanding motions. Try to coax the stain out with the sandpaper very gradually, and keep the sandpaper and stain wet. Sand until the stain is gone, but stop before you start taking off paint., Finish with a high-speed rotary polisher to remove any and all marks made by sanding. By doing this, you're effectively melting your clear coat around the stained area, blending it smooth.You can optionally apply a polish coat at this point. Use a pure polish on the buffed area to remove any unsightly swirl marks. If the egg damage is still not gone, you may have to do an area respray (spot-blending).
If you're not familiar with how to use a machine polisher or don't have access to one, take your car to a garage to be polished once you've removed the stain.

Purchase a small bottle of brake cleaner.,
Take a heavy-duty paper towel and fold it into a small square.,
Go over the stain with the brake cleaner.,
Repaint the area if necessary.",How to Remove Egg Stains from Car Paint3," This can be bought at any auto accessory store or superstore like Walmart in the automotive section. Brake cleaner is designed to absorb and erode oil, dirt, rust and stray paint, so if you need a higher-powered solution to your egg stain problem, it will likely do the trick.Caution: Brake cleaner is a toxic, corrosive and potentially flammable solution. Exercise care when using brake cleaner fluid at home. If applied improperly or left on too long, it could cause considerable damage to your car's paint., Create a compact, thick pad to use to apply the brake cleaner. Spray some cleaner onto the paper towel in an area slightly larger than a half-dollar. You can apply more later if you need to.


Paper towels are optimal when working with brake fluid as they can be disposed of. Avoid using a towel that you might reuse as the brake fluid is toxic and mildly corrosive.

, Make your motions smooth but firm. Wipe away as much of the stain as you can, reapplying more brake cleaner as needed.

, The impact and hardening of the egg stain may have chipped the paint, or the brake cleaner might have taken some paint off. Buy a small bottle of finishing paint from your dealership in the right color and touch up the areas where the paint is faded.If you want your paint to look best, the mechanics at your car's dealership can touch up your car professionally for a small fee.

Pick up a Wash & Wax solution.,
Spray the Wash & Wax onto the stain.,
Use a nylon scraper to remove the stain.,
Reapply the Wash & Wax and rub out the spot.",How to Remove Egg Stains from Car Paint4," This specialty cleaner type was made for instances just like this one. The Wash & Wax will clean away dirt and stains and leave the paint polished to protect it, essentially mimicking the function of a clear coat of paint.Wash & Wax cleaners work essentially the same way that brake cleaner fluid does, but are intended for use on the vehicle's exterior and are safer for most common uses.
There is no guarantee that a Wash & Wax will work for its applied purpose here. They can be an effective cleaner for many types of dirt and stains that build up on vehicles, but you'll be using at your own risk.

, Cover the whole stain and let sit for a few minutes. The cleaner will begin to work on the stain on its own, saving you trouble and preventing potential damage later.

, Don't get too rough, as you'll be scraping directly against the paint. Take off as many pieces of the soaked stain as you can and wipe them away with a towel.Nylon scrapers are cheap and safe. It's better to spring for one than to use a harder scraper with unexpected results.

, Use another small amount of cleaner on the area where the stain was. Rub out any remnants of the stain or excess cleaner until the spot looks clean and smooth. The wax in the solution should leave your paint with a protective luster.


Use a microfiber cloth to buff the spot. In all, this should only take about 20 minutes, with minimal muscle.

Start off by cleaning up the header as best as you can.,
Know that after you’re done cleaning the header, rinse of the header with water and proceed to dry it with the paper towel.,
Find a place where you’re going to start the labor intensive work or sanding down the header.,
Grab your 800 grit sandpaper and rip it into four equal pieces.,
Spread the metal polish over the part of the header you'll be working on Make sure not to over apply the metal polish.,
Once you’re done with the sanding/polishing of the header, clean it again with your soapy water and give it a good wipe down with your rag/cloth or paper towels.Then give it a good rinse with some water.,
Grab another rag/cloth and get to work with the metal polish working it into the header until you get the shine you want.",How to Polish an Aftermarket Header," Using the soapy water and a rag/cloth to wipe most of it clean. Then dip a toothbrush into the soapy water to get the hard to reach places like in-between the collectors.;
, If you want the nicest shine possible or your header is rusted this is where you grab the rust cleaner and repeat step one using the rust cleaner instead of the soapy water. Once finished with the rust cleaner repeat step one again with the soapy water solution.

, Take your old newspaper and spread it out over your work area. After the finding your place to work put your gloves on. Then grab your brake cleaner and spray a clean rag/cloth or paper towels and wipe down the header. This should get all the parts you missed before with the soapy water solution clean.

, This makes handling the sandpaper a lot easier. Begin to work away at the rusted header. Once you start to see the sandpaper get clogged up, give it a quick rinse to clean it out. Repeat this step for the whole header until most of the difficult rust is gone.

, grab your 1000 grit sandpaper and again rip the sandpaper into four equal pieces. Then use the sandpaper together with the metal polish to get your desired results quicker. This way is faster than just using sandpaper alone. Your sandpaper will get clogged up and the metal polish will turn a rusty brown color. Don't worry just rinse out your sandpaper or grab a new piece. Then wipe off the old metal polish with your paper towel and add some more metal polish to the header. Remember not to over apply the polish.

, Now if the header is looking good to your satisfaction, re-install it on your car and skip to step. If not grab your sandpaper and give the header another light scuffing.

, It will not shine like chrome so; do not get your hopes too high. Remove any excess polish with paper towel and wipe it down with paper towels and brake cleaner, so the oil on your hands will not heat up and ruin the finish again!

",How to Polish Aluminum Wheels," You should also wash your hands after each stage.;
, This allows you to reach all parts of the wheels more easily. Also take off the center caps, wheel weights, valve stem covers, stickers, or anything else that might obstruct you when preparing and polishing your aluminum wheels.

,


Rinse thoroughly with water to be sure all the soap and grime is gone. If you don't get it all off, you could rub grime into the aluminum surface during subsequent step.

, Let the oven cleaner penetrate for approximately 20 minutes. If you have a clear coat, skip this step. The oven cleaner can damage the clear coat.


Scrub the wheels with a dish scrubber that can be used on Teflon.
Rinse the rims thoroughly with water. If necessary, you might need to clean the wheels again with the oven cleaner.

, Curb rash is a scrape on a wheel caused by rubbing against the curb during parking. Eliminate it by carefully filing with a flat file.

, and a 600 – 400 grit wet and dry paper, or a foam painter's pad. If there is any pitting in your wheels, you will need to us the abrasive pad to sand it smooth. If you use a grit lower than 180, you risk damaging the wheel. Test an inconspicuous spot first to make sure you can remove the pitting without leaving marks on the wheels.


If your wheels have a clear coat, do not use anything abrasive to clean them.
Start with a 600 grit paper and if you need something a little rougher to buff out deeper scratches, move up to the 400 grit, and so on. You must be very careful not to scratch or unbalance the wheel.
All your strokes with the paper should be even and in the same direction.
If you use the 400 grit paper, you'll need to follow it with the finer 600 grit to get out all the scratches.

,, This will help restore the aluminum and remove oxidation. Wipe the wheels with a cloth.

,


Rub the polish into the rims. Use smooth strokes going in the same direction when shining aluminum wheels.
Use a toothbrush to polish hard-to-reach spots on your wheels. Place a soft cloth around the toothbrush so the bristles don't mar the finish.
Concentrate on polishing small areas of the wheel at one time before moving on. This gives the most uniform results without leaving portions of the rim looking cloudy.

,, The more you rub, the shinier the wheels will become.

Polish the wax off with a microfiber towel.",How to Polish a Car," The first step to polishing your car is to wash it, and you should always wash a vehicle in a shady area. Direct sunlight could cause the soap you use to dry onto the paint, which will dull the finish. Find a place that keeps the entire vehicle out of direct sunlight and park it there.Make sure you park the vehicle on a solid surface. Dirt or grass are not recommended, as you may get mud on the car after you wash it.
An overcast day is a great time to wash and polish your car, as long as it doesn’t rain.;
, Polishing the car can be a messy process. When you turn the polisher on, it may spray rubbing compound as it starts to spin. Make sure your pets are inside and there’s nothing around the vehicle that you can’t get sprayed with some loose polish.The polish will wash away easily, but you may not want to clean some things.
Keep children and pets away during the polishing process.

, Spray water all over the entire vehicle to prepare it for you to hand wash it. If possible, use the water to remove any large bits of debris or dirt that are stuck on the paint of the car.Start from the top and work your way down to the bottom of the vehicle as you rinse it.
Make sure to rinse the wheels and bottom portion of the car thoroughly, as it’s where dirt and mud are most likely to stick to the paint.

, If you intend to wash your wheels and tires on the same day that you polish the paint, make sure to clean them first. Use a different sponge and bucket to clean your wheels than you use on the car’s paint.You may get harsh wheel detergents on the paint of the vehicle when cleaning your wheels, so doing so first will allow you to clean the detergents from the paint.
Rinsing the wheels may also splatter dirt or mud onto the paint you can then wash off.

, Fill a bucket with water and a small amount of automotive soap. Choose a soap that does not have wax or polish in it. Dunk a clean sponge into the bucket and begin washing your car from the top and work your way down..


Rinse the sponge in the bucket or with your hose as necessary.
Make sure to clean the paint on your car thoroughly before you polish it. Any debris or dirt on the paint could result in damaging swirls or scratches when you begin the polishing process.

, Dark colored vehicles are more prone to swirling the paint when you polish your car, so use a softer pad and compound if your vehicle’s paint is dark. You can use more aggressive pads and compounds on lighter color cars with little issue.You can purchase pads and compounds at your local auto parts store.
The two often come in kits.

, Take the pad for your polishing wheel and get it wet using clean water. Wring it out so it remains damp, but not soaking wet. The pad must stay damp through the polishing process to avoid damaging your car’s paint.A dry pad will burn the clear coat on your car.
Keep a bucket of clean water or a hose nearby throughout the polishing process.

, Put a moderate amount of polishing compound on the pad, then turn on the polishing wheel and press it into the paint of the vehicle. You may also apply the compound directly onto the body of the car, then bring the polisher to it.Read the instructions on the specific polishing compound you purchased, as some may have specific steps you’ll need to take for the best result.
Once you finish one body panel, then move on to the next one.

, It is extremely important that you keep the polishing wheel parallel to whatever body panel you are currently polishing. Maintain an even amount of pressure over the wheel as you move it back and forth along the panel you are working on.Applying steady, constant pressure will reduce chances of damaging your paint.
The polishing wheel will be spinning, so you need only move it back and forth.

, As you polish the paint on the vehicle, the polishing compound will swirl and smear, then slowly disappear, leaving only the brilliant shine of the paint behind. Once you can see the shiny paint, you can move on to the next area and continue polishing.Unlike waxing the vehicle, you do no not need to wait for the polish to dry.
Don’t continue to polish shiny paint, as you may dull the finish.

, As you polish the vehicle, the polishing compound will begin to build up on the pad. Stop polishing occasionally to rinse the compound off of the pad, then wring the pad out again so it remains damp and fairly clean.Once too much polish compound on the pad it will compromise its polishing ability.
Remember to keep the pad damp throughout the process.

, The edge of the pad on the polishing wheel moves the fastest and usually comes into contact with the least of the rubbing compound, so it poses the biggest risk of burning the clear coat on your paint. As a result, be extremely careful as you buff around trim components that may come into contact with the edges of the pad.Take your time and avoid pressing the edge of the pad into any part of the car’s paint.
Be patient and rub polishing compound out of grooves the polishing wheel can’t reach.

, Once you have polished every panel on the body of the car, clean the polishing pad thoroughly and set it and the polishing wheel aside. Spray the entire vehicle down with a hose and wash the entire car again.Be sure to wash away any polishing compound that remains on the vehicle.
Rinse the car thoroughly after you’re done washing it.

, The paint on your car will need to be dry before you can wax it. You may dry the vehicle using microfiber towels if you’d like to expedite the process. If you have hard water, allowing the water to air dry could leave small spots on the paint, so you may want to use towels to keep water spots from forming.If you dry the car with towels, start from the top and work your way down.
Ensure the paint is completely dry before moving on to waxing.

, Use a good quality automotive wax to protect the newly polished paint and ensure it has a bright, shiny finish. Put some wax on the pad that comes with it and apply it to your car in a circular motion. Wax the entire vehicle, as the polishing process can leave the paint unprotected from the sun.Apply the wax one body panel at a time as well.
Make sure the vehicle is not in direct sunlight while waxing.

, Once the wax has dried, buff it off of the paint using microfiber towels. You can tell the wax has dried sufficiently by touching it with a bare finger. If the wax wipes off easily beneath your finger, it is dry and can be buffed off the vehicle.Once you have buffed off all of the wax, the paint will have a brilliant shine and finish.

Remove the valve cover with a ratchet and a properly fitted socket.,
Place the valve cover in a well-ventilated area on some newspaper or a piece of cardboard.,
Rinse the valve cover with water to make sure all of the paint stripper is removed including any small cracks and crevices.,

Spray the valve cover with high-heat paint, which is available at any auto parts store.,
Place the painted valve cover near a heated source to set the paint.,
Reinstall the painted valve cover onto the car, and replace all gaskets, seals, and bolts.

",How to Paint a Valve Cover," Most valve covers have 1 bolt at each corner. In some cases, as in 4-cylinder engines, the spark plug covers and seals must be removed. Once the valve cover is off, check the gasket around the bottom of the cover. If it is broken, it needs to be replaced before you install the valve cover again.;
, Put on protective gloves and goggles. Wipe paint stripper on the valve cover with paper towels or a scrub brush. Apply liberal amounts of the paint stripper to make sure all of the existing paint is removed.

, This is critical so that the new paint adheres to the cover properly. Let the valve cover dry completely.

, Fold the sandpaper sheet over to sand in the corners and along any crevices in the valve cover. Wipe the surface with wax and grease remover and a towel to remove any dust and fingerprints.

, Make sure to cover all the bolt holes so the threads don't become clogged with paint. Use a razor blade to carefully trim the masking tape so it fits correctly.

, Use a total of 4 or 5 coats of paint. Keep the coats light, and wait 5 minutes between each coat before applying the next. Wait 24 hours after the last coat before moving to the next step.

, It can be placed inside an oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes, or you can heat the cover with a heat gun for several minutes. Wear gloves when handling the heated valve cover because it will be very hot. Let the valve cover cool completely.

Close all of the windows and doors on the vehicle, but leave one window open wide enough to feed the duct into the vehicle.,
Seal off the remainder of the open window using plenty of cardboard and tape.,
Run the ozone generator at full power for at least 30 minutes but no longer than two hours.,
Air out the vehicle to allow the ozone to dissipate.",How to Do an Ozone Shock Treatment on a Vehicle," There are websites that will ship them, and some equipment rental places stock them as well.


Renting the right ozone generator will make the process more effective. While exact figures are not well-established, a generator rated at 3500mg/h is probably the bare minimum to do an effective shock treatment on a mid-sized car. Larger vehicles may require a more powerful generator. Units up to 12000 mg/h have been used effectively and safely. It is essential that the unit be compatible with a flexible duct.;
, Take everything out of the car, including the spare tire. Anything left behind could potentially be damaged or discolored by the ozone.

,, Some ozone machines will come with the duct, but any dryer duct will do. Duct tape may be helpful.

, The ozone generator should remain outside the vehicle to allow it access to fresh air.

, The idea is to seal up the car to prevent the ozone from escaping the vehicle.

, No one should be in the car during this process. No animals should be in the car during this process.


Do not run the generator longer than the recommended time.

, The slight ozone smell is normal and will disappear completely after three or four days. If necessary, repeat the ozone shock treatment after airing out the vehicle.

The first thing you need to do properly is to wash down your car effectively.,
Soaping down the car is always carried out from top to bottom.,
If your surfaces feel sandy after washing, use a clay bar to remove contaminants.,
The next step after soaping down is to thoroughly hose down any soap and dirt left on the car and then chamois down.,
Car polishing the exterior of your car is the next phase.,
Once you have a DA Polisher you are going to need three polishing pads, then you will need a


Paint cleaner of your choice
Polish of your choice
Wax of your choice

,
The first application is going to be the paint cleaning stage.,
When you have completed the first stage, it is time to move onto the second stage.,
The third and last stage is going to be the waxing or sealing stage.",How to Do External Car Detailing Properly," There is no point trying to do external car detailing if you are just going to end up scratching your Duco even more because you left dirt on your car.


You must first hose down your car with firm pressure. Don't use a laser type wash from your hose, but rather a small funnel. Always start from top and work your way down. It is advisable you hose for a few minutes as this allows dirt to soften up and break free from your paint.
What some people do is also is fill a bucket of water with detergent and throw it over the car, let it sit for a minute and then hose down. These products are designed to loosen dirt before hosing down. If you have a Gerni or pressure blaster, that's even better as this removes even more dirt.
If you own a four wheel drive and it is covered in mud or heavy dirt, if you don't have a pressure blaster, purchase one. There are also many detergents which you can throw on off road vehicles and even bikes, which you let sit for a while and then blast off. Once clean, you need to move onto the next step.;
, Never wash from bottom up as this just takes dirt from your sills and drags it up towards shinier paint. Never use sponges, as sponges (even automotive one's) scratch and swirl car paint. It doesn't take much for a sponge to inflict fine scratches, especially if you haven't washed down properly.

, Use what is known as a wash mitt. There are many brands of wash mitts on the market, and they are not hard like sponges and tend to have a lifting effect of dirt rather than a dragging effect of dirt while soaping down your paint. Use the lambs wool versions as they are very soft and apply no pressure on paint.

, Some people prefer leather chamois over synthetic. The only problem is finding a nice thick quality chamois. They generally don't last long these days, and you have to keep replacing them after twelve odd months.

, To actually do this process properly, there are really three steps if you want optimal results and a killer finish (depth of color and strong gloss). Not a mediocre result. Put some elbow grease into this process, and believe me you will be happy with the outcome. If you want to get the best results from achieving shiny paint, you need speed in your polishing. So, forget about hand polishing (unless you don't want your shoulder at the end of this process). If you don't have one, you will need a DA Polisher with the right pads.

,, When you have acquired your new DA Polisher attach the first polishing pad to your DA Polisher. Apply in a thin application as a snail pattern on the pad your paint cleaner and dab on your paint about a foot or two in coverage of your surfaces. Do not apply too much product on your pad as it will take too long to buff off. Buff vertically and then horizontally at about 3-4 thousand RPMs. When you have done about four to five passes then wipe off any residue left. The first pass is designed to remove any hairline swirls, and or mild etchings and faded paint. Continue this process all over the entire car. Every time you do a section, use a microfiber cloth to wipe down and check on your work.

, The second pass is going to be your polishing stage. Don't try to focus on what is a good polish. Just ask your local auto care outlet what a good quality car polish is and they will recommend you one. Change to a clean pad. Use exactly the same procedure as that of the paint cleaning or first stage pass and go over the entire vehicle. The second pass is designed to bring the best possible shine to your paint

, This stage is a little different and there are a couple of differences between waxes and sealers You will need to now change to the third pad. The difference between wax and sealers is really only a couple of things. waxes don't generally last as long, but the finish is also quite a natural one as well. Lots of depth of colour, and a beautiful shine. Sealers, otherwise known as synthetics, last longer, but also leave an artificial finish, more like a mirror finish. The choice however is yours. When you apply any of these products, apply them in a thin fashion over your paint. If you apply these products in large volumes on your paint, they can be an absolute nightmare to remove. Use exactly the same procedure for applying your wax or sealer as you did with the first two procedures. The only thing you do differently here is you leave the wax or sealer on your car for about half to one hour to set. Once it has set, you are ready to wipe off the wax or sealer. This stage is designed to protect the finish and seal in the shine. If you do all these procedures correctly, you will definitely achieve the results you are looking for. Happy car detailing

, If you're not going to use liquids afterward, your detailing brushes should be a super-absorbant material like microfiber cloth, which picks up dust and dirt efficiently. Lightly mist some spray-on vinyl dressing onto the vent grilles to make them look brand new.

, Cleaning the seats is essential for a good detail. But different seats require different methods. Note that after cleaning, you may have to vacuum out the seats or surrounding area again, as dirt will be loosened up by this process.


Cloth interiors: Interiors with nylon or other cloth can be shampooed with a wet-vac extraction machine. Cloth should be adequately dried after extraction has taken place.
Leather or vinyl interiors: Interiors with leather or can be cleaned with a leather or vinyl cleaner and then hit softly with a leather brush. Cleaner can be wiped away with a microfiber cloth afterward.

, If you've cleaned leather seats with product, now's the time to condition them so that the leather looks visually appealing and doesn't dry out or begin to crack.

, For stronger build-up removal, use 4-ought steel wool on windows. Use plastic cleaner if the gauge cover is made of plastic.


Stick with microfiber cloth when you're washing and wiping. If not microfiber, use a clean, lint-free cloth. You don't want to leave fibrous residue all over the inside of the car in the process of cleaning up.

, Hit the wheel rims first, as this is where most of the dirt, grime, and grease accumulates and you may need to leave cleaning product on for a while. Allow product to penetrate wheel rims for 30 seconds to 1 minute before brushing.


Acid-based cleaners should only can be used on rough-textured alloy wheels, if needed, but not on polished alloy wheels or clear-coated wheels.
Gleam up chrome wheels with metal polish or glass cleaner.

, Apply tire dressing. For a glossy finish, let the dressing soak in, or wipe it on and off with a cotton cloth for a matte look.

, Spray degreaser on everything, after which spray down with pressure washer.

, For a glossy look, allow the protectant to soak in. For a more matte finish, wipe it off.

, Factory tinting is built into the glass itself, so you have to worry less about that, but after-market tinting is more degradable and could suffer from cleaners that contain ammonia and/or vinegar. Check your cleaners before applying to tinted windows.

, Park the car in a shady spot and wait until the car's surface is cool to the touch. Use a deep-pile terrycloth microfiber towel which will trap contaminants and not grind them into the car's surface.



Tip: Use two pails — one with sudsy cleaner, the other with water — when you clean. After you dip your cloth into the sudsy water and clean a portion of the car, dip the dirty, sudsy water into the pail with water so that you don't contaminate the cleaning pail.






Dishwashing detergent strips the polymers off the paint surface and accelerates the oxidation process.






Work from the top down, washing and rinsing a section at a time. Do not allow soap to dry.






Take the spray nozzle off the water hose before doing a final rinse to minimize spots.






Use a chamois or terry cloth towel to dry; do not let air-dry or soap spots will form.







, The glass on newly-detailed cars should shine and reflect, not be dull and grimy. In order to get that reflective polish on the windows,

, Add a vinyl dressing to the wells for a dazzling effect.

, You can use a traditional clay bar to remove things like sap, but a liquid clay bar is quicker and almost as effective.

, Rotary buffers should be left to the professionals.


Polish is for a glossy look. Wax is a protectant.
Use in length-wise sections. Do not move the machine in a circular pattern.
Pay attention to doorjambs, around door hinges and behind bumpers, which you will need to do in a circular motion by hand.
Let it dry to a haze. Then finish the auto detailing by buffing with the machine. The hard-to-reach areas can be buffed by hand.

Blow on the lock with a straw.",How to De Ice a Car Lock2," Hand sanitizer contains alcohol, which is useful for melting away the ice in your keyhole. Squirt a small amount of hand sanitizer onto your key. Then, gently insert the key into the lock and unlock the door.If you use hand sanitizer too frequently, you will eventually get sticky locks. It is best to use this solution as a last resort or when you run out of de-icer.If your car door gets dirty from using too much hand sanitizer, you will need to get to the interior locking mechanism to clean it. You should get a professional mechanic or automobile locksmith to clean your car door., Use a lighter to warm up your car key. Hold your key over the flame of the lighter until it warms up. Then, insert the key into the lock. The warm key should help melt away the ice in your car lock.You could also use a match.
Be careful not to burn yourself when heating up the key with your lighter.

, If you are really in a pinch, you could pour your coffee or other hot beverage over the lock. The hot liquid should help melt away the ice. However, this is obviously more of a last resort than an advisable solution, since you will lose your beverage in the process.If you pour too many hot liquids into your lock, you’ll need to clean it. Go to a professional mechanic to get your car door cleaned and lubricated., Place one end of a straw on the car lock. Hold the other end of the straw in your mouth. Blow warm air into the straw. The heat from your breath should eventually melt the ice in the car lock.In comparison to other techniques, blowing hot air in a straw will likely take the longest.
You probably won’t get very far blowing hot air without the straw, since the heat will evaporate before it reaches the lock.

Press the metal ring downward onto the first few clips.,
Bend the ring slightly to secure the last clips.,
Verify the size of your wheels.,
Assess whether or not a wheel cover can be installed.,
Ensure old wheel covers have been removed.,
Make sure the retention ring is installed on new wheel covers.",How to Install Wheel Covers," While some wheel covers can be installed without removing lug nuts, you may often find that the lug nuts on your wheel are intended to help hold the wheel cover in place. If need to remove the lug nuts on the wheel, first loosen the lug nuts, then jack the car up.Always jack your vehicle up on solid, level surfaces like blacktop or concrete.
Place jack stands beneath the vehicle once you jack it up for safety.;
, Use a tire iron or socket wrench to completely unscrew the lug nuts holding the wheel onto your vehicle. Set the lug nuts aside for you to use when mounting the wheel back onto the vehicle.Turn the lug nuts counter-clockwise to unscrew them.
Be careful not to misplace any lug nuts. It is not safe to drive your vehicle with fewer than the provided amount of lug nuts.

, The retention ring on the back of the wheel cover will have an indentation in it, as well as a hole through the wheel cover in the same area. This gap is intended to allow the valve stem to pass through the cover for you to access when adding air to your tires.Be sure to align the gap in the cover and retention ring with the valve stem so it can pass through.
Many wheel covers will have a drawing of a valve stem on the back intended to help you identify where the valve stem passes through.

, With the valve stem properly aligned through the wheel cover, press the wheel cover directly onto the wheel. If you did not need to remove your lug nuts, the wheel cover should pop into place and not come back off the wheel easily.If you do not need to use lug nuts to secure the wheel cover, pull on it a bit to ensure it will not come off while driving.
The wheel cover should not feel loose, nor should it be easily pulled off.

, If you removed the lug nuts previously, use your hands to thread each nut onto a lug stud passing through the wheel and wheel cover. Once you are confident the lug nuts are properly threaded, use a wrench or tire iron to tighten them.Be sure to re-tighten the lug nuts once you lower the vehicle down off of the jack.
Be sure all lug nuts are tight before attempting to drive the vehicle.

, If your wheel covers did not come with the retention rings installed, remove them from the packaging and place them face down on a surface that won’t scuff or damage their finish.You can place the wheel covers in grass or on a soft material like cloth or Styrofoam.
Be sure you don’t move the wheel covers around as they lay face down to avoid scuffing or scratching them.

, The retention ring will have a bend in it designed to allow the valve stem to pass through it. Line that bend up with the hole in the wheel cover that is also intended for the valve stem to pass through.There will be only one bend in the ring, making it easy to identify the parts to line up.
If the ring is not lined up properly, it will mount on the wheel cover, but will not be able to mount on the wheel itself.

, Use your thumbs to press the ring down onto the clips that will hold it in place. Different wheel covers will have a different number of clips, but there are usually at least six.Simply pressing down on the ring will snap the clips into place.
Continue to press the ring into each snap all the way around the wheel cover.

, It may seem as though the ring is too large for the wheel cover as you get to the final few clips. This is common, and likely does not indicate that there is any problem. Bend the ring slightly in order to clip it into the final few clips.Once the ring is in all of the clips it will redistribute the pressure and fit properly.
If the ring is far too large to be clipped in, it may be the wrong ring for the size wheel cover.

, If your wheel covers will not mount on the vehicle, it may be because the covers were made for a different sized wheel. Automotive wheels come in a wide variety of sizes that are usually measured in inches.Check the size of the wheel you have by locating the tire size printed on the tire. The last number in the tire size (such as P215/65 R15) is the number of inches the wheel is in diameter.
Be sure the wheel cover you purchased is intended for that size wheel.

, Some kinds of wheels cannot have wheel covers mounted on them because of their design. Often, decorative wheel designs do not permit the mounting of a wheel cover. If there isn’t a lip around the perimeter of the wheel, the wheel cover likely won’t mount.Look for a lip around the outside of the wheel for the retention ring to seat in.
If there is no lip, wheel covers likely cannot be installed.

, If your new wheel cover will not seat properly on the wheel, be sure the old wheel cover has already been removed. Also check to see if the lug nuts are still in place, as many wheel covers are meant to be installed beneath lug nuts.Thin wheel covers that come from the factory may be difficult to distinguish from steel rims in some instances.
Your new wheel covers may require the removal of lug nuts before they can be mounted.

, If the new wheel covers do not mount to your wheels, check to make sure the retention rings are installed properly on the underside of the covers.If the retention rings are not installed, you will need to install them prior to mounting the wheel covers.
Most new wheel covers come with retention rings. If you do not have them, return to where you purchased the covers to get rings to mount them.

Listen for snapping or popping when you turn.,
Listen for grinding or dragging while you drive.,
See if the buzzing sound changes as you change speeds.",How to Know if Your Wheel Bearings Are Going Bad1," Snapping, popping, and clicking are all signs that the outer CV joint, which is the joint that connects your wheel to the axle, is starting to wear out. Sometimes, more severe turns will create a louder snapping or popping noise. If you hear this while you're driving, there's a good chance you have a bad axle.Listen to what side the rattling is on, so you have an idea of which wheel bearing is going bad.;
, When driving, worn out wheel bearings will sometimes sound like a break pad grinding or dragging. The longer you drive, the louder the grinding will sound. Drive down the road at 40 mph (17.8 mps) and listen for any grinding that you hear coming from your wheels., A common sign of a worn bearing is if the sound that's coming from your wheel changes as you accelerate or decelerate. If you already hear a buzzing or snapping sound, see if it gets more or less intense the faster you go. If the sound varies depending on how fast you're going, there's a good chance there's an issue with your wheel bearings."

Insert the valve stem through its hole in the wheel.,
Screw the valve stem tool onto the valve stem.,
Use the handle to pull on the valve stem.,
Pull until the top ring comes through the wheel.,
Unscrew the valve stem tool.",How to Install Valve Stems on Tires1," Look at the wheel before getting started and identify the hole through it that the valve stem is supposed to go through. Press the valve stem into the hole from inside where the tire will mount, so the nozzle is sticking out of the inside of the wheel.Hold the valve stem in place with your finger until you can secure it to the valve stem tool.
There is only one hole through the rim so it should be easy to find.;
, Place the valve stem tool over the threaded portion of the valve stem and rotate it clockwise to tighten the two together. The threads on the stem should be the same as the threads on the tool, but be careful not to cross thread the tool onto the stem.If the tool is not threading on properly, unscrew it and attempt to screw it on again.
Hold the valve stem from the other side with your finger so it doesn’t rotate with the tool.

, Once the valve stem is secured to the valve stem tool, place the handle up against the lip of the rim. Press down on the end of the handle like a lever, so it pulls up on the valve stem and pulls it through the rim.You may want to place a rag beneath the handle of the tool on the lip of the wheel to protect its finish.
You may need to apply a good deal of pressure in order to wedge the valve stem in the hole properly.

, The diameter of the valve stem increases the closer you get to its base and there are two rings in the valve stem at its widest portion. Continue to apply pressure to the valve stem tool until you’ve pulled the first ring through the hole in the wheel.The bottom ring should be seated firmly against the inside of the wheel.
The top ring should be on the outside of the wheel, holding it securely in place.

, Once the valve stem is properly seated in the wheel, press on the bottom of it as you rotate the valve stem tool counter clockwise to unscrew it from the stem. Once done, press on the valve stem and move it around with your fingers. It should not come loose from the wheel.Don’t apply too much pressure when testing the valve stem or you may push it back through the hole.

Don't go out on the roads before testing out the fit on your tires.,
Give yourself enough time to fit the tires, and come dressed for business.,
Remove your snow chains as soon as you reach clear road.",How to Install Snow Chains on Tires," If you have the time to do this prior to venturing out into the dark, icy world, your fingers (and patience) will thank you. On the road, this process can take longer than you think.






;
, Try to get the chain hanging over the top three-quarters of the tire, making sure that the chains running from side-to-side are straight.









Some types of snow chains will have rings fastened to the chains. These rings belong on the inside of the tire, and should rest on the bottom of the tire, near the ground, during installation.This will require you to get under your car in order to install, and may require a little tweaking.
Tuck the chains under the tire so as you drive over them (the next step), they will be ready for attachment on the rear side.

, Put the car in gear, disengage the parking brake, and roll forward slightly. Remember, only a small portion of the tires was unfitted, so you'll only need to drive forward a bit. When you determined that you've gone forward enough to ensure full coverage, park the car and engage the parking brake once more.








, Starting from the inner part of the tire (near the tire axle), connect the two hooked edges. Do the same on the outside portion of the tires. Using a closer link, tighten the chain links so that they move as little as possible when you do drive.









If you are using link unit chains, try not to use any chain tightening tools. Traditional chains can be tightened with a link tightening tool.
A bungee cord with hook fasteners is a common way to make chains fit even tighter over your tires, especially if the chains don't have built-in tightening cams. These can usually be bought anywhere where snow chains are sold.

, If the inner portion of the chain is tight, but the outside is loose, you will need to align them.

, Once you've had a bit of experience putting on snow chains, you can start installing chains on rear or front tires simultaneously. Doing this will drastically speed up the process.








, Over the course of driving a little, the snow chains will shift a bit and will need to be re-tightened in order to secure the tightest bond.








, A lot of people don't know how many tires they should put snow chains on. It is a good idea to install chains on all four tires, regardless of one or two drive axels. This way you have equal braking when stopping and your axel won't slide.









Alternatively, you may want to put chains on on all drive wheels of the car.So if your car has front-wheel drive, put the chains on the two front wheels of the car. If your car is 4WD or AWD, put snow chains on all four wheels of your car.

, In order to find out what the right size snow chain is for your particular car, you need to know how large your tire is. Look for a long string of letters and numbers on the outside of your tires. The first number tells you the tire width; the second numbers tells you the tire height ratio (the ratio of the sidewall height to the width); and the third number tells you the diameter of the wheel, usually denoted in inches.You'll need this information when you go shopping for snow chains.









Before buying chains, refer to your owner's manual. There are certain rim-tire combinations on some vehicles that are not compatible with tire chains and can cause damage to the vehicle.

, It sounds simple, but it's a mistake a lot of people make. They assume that the chains fit like a glove, and when the time comes to install them out on the roads, they realize that the chains are unusable because the fit is wrong. Don't put yourself up a creek. Do yourself a solid and dry-fit your chains before driving in the snow.








, Because the idea behind fastening chains seems so easy, a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that it will take a few minutes and then they'll be on their way. Not so fast. Under conditions that call for chains — wet, snowy, dark — putting on snow chains can take an hour or more. And unless you want to be cold, dirty, and drenched, wear proper rain gear instead of your ski-suit.

, If conditions improve, or you come across a sign indicating that snow chains are no longer needed, take off your chains. Don't keep on driving with your chains — it puts a beating on the road, as well as your tires.

Feel your steering wheel to determine if it's vibrating.,
Pay attention to whether your wheels wobble.,
See if your ABS light comes on.,
Determine if your car drifts to one side.",How to Know if Your Wheel Bearings Are Going Bad2," If you're driving and your steering wheel is wobbling or vibrating, it's a good sign you may need to replace your bearings. When bearings break down, it can make your car feel ""loose,"" which results in poor handling and a vibrating or wobbling steering wheel., As you drive at higher speeds, your wheels may start to wobble from side to side. This is a sign that your bearings are going bad. Unfortunately, wobbling wheels are usually a sign of significant bearing damage, so you should stop driving and get them replaced immediately if this is the case., Cars with an antilock brake system will often have an indicator light on their dashboard. If this light comes on, there's a possibility it could be because of bad bearings. See if there are any additional symptoms to determine if it's your wheel bearings or a different part of your break and suspension system., If your vehicle has a tendency to drift to one side when you're driving, the bearings may be bad. Drive down a straight road at a moderate speed and feel if the wheel is automatically turning to one side without you controlling it.This symptom alone isn't a great indicator of bad wheel bearings because it can be caused by a multitude of other wheel alignment problems.

Position the jack near the wheel that you suspect has a bad bearing and jack up your car so that the wheel clears the road.Make sure that you take the proper precautions when using a jack so that your car doesn't accidentally fall and injure you.

, Push and pull on the wheel back and forth to feel if there's any give.If you can push the wheel back and forth, this is a sign of significant bearing damage. Get your bearings replaced immediately if your wheels wobble as you drive., If you suspect a back wheel has a bad bearing, put your hand on the wheel and spin it as fast as you can. If the bearing is bad, it's likely it will make a rattling noise as you turn it. While it's not as severe as a wobbling wheel, rattling wheel bearings should be replaced as soon as possible.The longer that you drive on a damaged wheel bearing, the worse the damage will get over time.

, If you're still unsure but suspect that there is something wrong with your wheel bearings, you should take it to a certified mechanic so that they can properly diagnose the problem."

Jack up the vehicle.,
Remove the lug nuts on the wheel.,
Pull the wheel off and lay it down face up.,
Release the air in the tire with a valve change tool.,
Press the valve down to the side and insert the tool.,
Turn the valve change tool and pull the valve out.",How to Install Valve Stems on Tires2," You will need to remove the wheel from the vehicle it’s on if it isn’t already. Slide a jack beneath the closest designated jack point to the wheel in question and raise and lower or rotate the handle in order to lift it up off the ground.Use a tire iron or socket wrench to break the lug nuts loose on the wheel prior to jacking up the vehicle.
Place a jack stand beneath the vehicle to support it while you work on the wheel.

, Use the same tire iron or wrench to unscrew the lug nuts on the wheel the rest of the way by turning them counter-clockwise. Once you have removed all of the lug nuts, set them aside someplace safe for when you reinstall the wheel.If you misplace a lug nut, you can purchase replacements at your local auto parts store.

, With the lug nuts removed, the wheel may come off of the lug studs easily, but in some instances it may be stuck on due to oxidization or rust. If the wheel won’t come off, hit the rubber sidewall of the tire with a rubber mallet all the way around the wheel to break it loose.Lay the wheel down on the ground face up so the valve stem is toward the sky.
Do not strike the wheel itself as you may damage it.

, Press the rounded portion of the valve change tool into the valve in the center of the valve stem. When you apply pressure to the center valve, the air inside the tire will begin to leak out. There is quite a bit of pressure in the tire, so prepare yourself for a large burst of air.You may want to wear gloves to prevent the air escaping from being too cold on your hands.
You can also use a screw driver or similar tool to release the air.

, With all the air released from the tire, use your thumb to press the valve to the side so it is flat against the wheel. Take the valve change tool and press the hook down into the base of the valve stem so it goes into the wheel.You may need to apply a good amount of pressure to get the tool past the valve stem.
Be careful not to scratch the finish of the wheel with the valve change tool.

, With the valve change tool inserted, rotate it in either direction a quarter turn, then pull it straight back up out of the wheel. The hook on the tool will catch the bottom of the valve stem and pull it out with the tool.Try to pull straight outward from the wheel to avoid chipping the finish.

Place the insertion tube over the valve stem hole.,
Lubricate the new valve stem.,
Press the valve stem into the tire with one quick motion.,
Pull up on the insertion tool with a strong jerk.",How to Install Valve Stems on Tires3," Valve stem replacement tool kits come with an insertion tube that should be placed over the valve stem hole with the larger opening facing up. Make sure the tube is correctly aligned with the hole; if it is even slightly misaligned it will stop you from inserting the new valve stem.You can purchase valve stem replacement tool kits at your local auto parts store.
The insertion tube will guide the new valve stem as you press it into place.

, Take the new valve stem and cover it in an automotive lubricant designed to create a seal once the valve stem is in place. The lubricant will make it easier to insert the valve stem through the valve stem hole.You can purchase tire sealant lubricant at your local auto parts store.
You may be able to insert the valve stem without lubricant, but the seal will be stronger if you use it.

, Insert the valve stem top first into the insertion tool that resembles a screw driver, then slide the stem and tool into the insertion tube. With one swift motion, press the valve stem down through the tube and hole in the rim, then pull back up to pull the top of the stem through the wheel.You will need to thread the valve stem onto the insertion tool so you can pull it back up once inserted.
You may need to apply a good deal of pressure to get the stem through the hole.

, Just as you swiftly pressed the stem through the hole, now pull backward on the handle in one swift motion to pull the majority of the valve stem back through it. The bottom ring of the valve stem will prevent it from passing all the way back through, properly seating the valve stem.If you accidentally pull the stem all the way back through, repeat the process to reinsert it.
You can now refill the tire and place it back on the vehicle.

Depending on the application, that may be the front wheels, the rear wheels, or all four. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual if you are unsure which wheels are the drive wheels.Front wheel drive cars (FWD) will use snow chains on the front wheels.
Rear wheel drive cars (RWD) will use them on the rear.
All wheel drive (AWD) or four-wheel drive (4WD) will need them on all four wheels.;
, The chain packaging will state which tires it fits, but don't be afraid to ask for advice at your local auto parts store. It is more important that you find chains intended to fit on the size tire you have, rather than for your specific vehicle, as aftermarket wheels or tires may change the size required. Never attempt to use chains that are too large or too small, as this could result in dangerous driving and damage to your car.
If you are unsure of what size tires you have, you can find the sizes printed on the sidewall of each of them.

, Most people find themselves in need of using snow chains while they are already on the road. Hazardous driving conditions that require snow chains in conjunction with snow banks on the sides of the road can make stopping to mount your chains dangerous, so look for a safe, open space with enough room for you to work without being in the road. A wide stretch of road with a broad shoulder or a parking lot will allow for proper chain placement while keeping you safe.
Never install your snow chains in the road, as other vehicles may not be able to stop before hitting you.

, Installing snow chains will require that you put your hands into the wheel wells of your vehicle, which will likely be heavily caked with ice, slush and snow. In order to protect your hands and fingers from frost bite, put on a pair of insulated gloves before you begin installing the snow chains. Waterproof gloves are preferable, as they will likely become wet as you work.

, For front wheel drive vehicles lay both sets of chains by the 2 front tires. For rear-wheel drive vehicles, place them near the rear tires. Untangle the chains and lay them out in a ‘web’ shape. If you have a 4WD vehicle you must apply snow chains to all 4 tires to retain full control. You may need to remove your gloves to untangle the chains if they are extremely tangled.

, Drape the chain over the first tire. It should fit snug despite the lower part of the tire not be attached yet. If necessary, knock any snow buildup in the wheel well out so you can access both sides of the tire. Be sure the chain is draped over the width of the tire, and not simply on the outside that is easiest to access.

, Some snow chain sets come with rings called keepers that help secure the chain in place on your tire. Connect the keepers to your rim by following the instructions that came with the chains. Different chain sets that have keepers may utilize different methods of securing them.
The keepers will help ensure the chains don’t fall off as you move the vehicle forward to complete the installation.

, Once you have the first wheel draped with the chains, do the same to the other side of the vehicle. If your vehicle is equipped with four wheel drive, you will need to repeat the process for all four wheels before moving on to the next step. By placing all of the chains before moving the vehicle, you will reduce the number of times you have to pull the vehicle forward in order to attach all of the chains.
You should never drive a vehicle with only one chain installed.

, With the chains on each drive wheel, pull the vehicle forward to expose the bottom portion of the wheels and tires that you have not yet been able to secure the chains to. Ask a friend to tell you when to stop once you have rotated the wheels so the unchained bottom is now facing up.
The distance you will need to move forward will vary depending on the size of your wheels and tires.

, Once you have moved the vehicle forward far enough to access the unchained portion of the tires, secure the chains to the bare area in the same fashion you secured them to the rest of the wheel. Make sure to connect the keepers to this area as well if your chains came equipped with them. Make sure to repeat the process on each drive wheel.
The chains should now be secure and snug on the wheels and tires.

, Get into the vehicle and drive it down the road slowly for a few hundred yards. Then get out and inspect the snow chains for any slack as they have started to find their placement in the grooves of the tires. Tighten the chains where needed with a closer link provided with the snow chains kit. If the chains are loose, they will not function properly.
Follow the directions in the chain kit for the installation of the closer link, as different brands have different application methods.

, The ride in your vehicle will be louder than normal due to the chains, but if you hear a sound coming directly from one of the vehicle’s wheel wells, it may be indicative of a chain that’s come loose. Stop the vehicle and inspect the chains any time you hear something unusual from the wheel wells.Loose or damaged chains can whip around, damaging the body of your vehicle.

, Give yourself an opportunity to get accustomed to driving with snow chains by starting off very slowly. The vehicle’s driving dynamic will be different due to the chains on the wheels and the difficult driving conditions, so it may take some getting used to. Take it slow until you begin to feel comfortable with how the vehicle handles with snow chains in place.

, Driving at speeds in excess of 25 miles per hour with snow chains on is not recommended and can be unsafe. The chains may wear quickly or even come apart at high speeds, which can cause damage to your vehicle or cause you to lose control. Remember that chains help propel you, but cannot help you stop on icy surfaces.
Always maintain a safe speed for the environment, particularly in hazardous and snowy conditions.

",How to Install Brake Calipers on Car Wheels," Concrete is best, as jacks and jack stands can sink into asphalt on hot summer days. This affects the stability of the vehicle and damages the asphalt surface. Work in a shady spot or direct sun? It will probably take a few hours to do both sides of one axle if it is the first time doing this work, so plan accordingly.;
, Assume the driver side will be worked on first for this wiki.

,, Place one chock block ahead of the front tire and a second behind the rear tire to prevent the vehicle from rolling in either direction.

, to allow access to the lug nuts.

,, Use the manufacturer's supplied jack or use a floor jack to raise the vehicle, and locate to lift only at the manufacturer's designated points on the vehicle.

, Do not attempt to work on any vehicle supported only by a jack. If supporting the vehicle at the axle, do so closest to the wheels. Do not support or lift the axle solely at the the differential.

,,,, Note: these are made of soft metal and are easily damaged. Slip a length of snug fitting clear hose over the screw to direct fluid into a container on the ground.

, Do this until the pads are no longer pressed firmly against the rotor. Expect brake fluid to be expelled from the bleeder screw as the piston is forced into the caliper.

, Do not turn hose more than half a turn to avoid kinking the hose. (On some vehicles a banjo bolt secures the hose to the caliper, in which case the hose can be removed in this step, and step 16 may be omitted.)

, On rear disk brakes, the parking brake is removed from the caliper and the procedure varies from vehicle to vehicle. It will not be possible to remove the rear caliper if the parking brake is engaged.

,,, The correct caliper will have the bleeder nut oriented at the top (or very close to the top) after being installed on the vehicle. Failure to install the correct caliper will trap air in the system. This will cause a ""spongy"" feeling brake pedal and possibly brake failure. Hold both calipers near the rotor, oriented as they would be installed on the vehicle and install only the caliper that has the bleeder nut at the top.

, The bulk of this brake work is the caliper and pad removal and replacement. Not servicing the rotors while accessible now is practically ""negligent"". Consider removing the rotor for machining (called ""turning"" on a lathe) to remove glazing, gouges and grooves. Well traveled rotors are often glazed and result in extended stopping distances. If the rotor is too worn or has deep grooves or has significant rust; replacement may be required (often times replacing with new rotors for $25 or so is better than machining old rotors for $15). Actual cost of machining or replacement rotors is dependent on vehicle type, supply house pricing, etc., and is a matter of personal choice. Many full service auto supply shops offer rotor machining. It is illegal however, to machine rotors that are too thin or otherwise unsafe for re-installation on the vehicle.

,(this step is not needed, if c-clamp was used during caliper removal)

,,,, Slip clear hose over the screw to direct fluid into a container on the ground. Release the hose clamping pliers or vice grips.

, Add additional fluid to maintain the level above minimum.

, Tighten bleeder. Have helper pump brakes 3 times, and hold. release bleeder valve. to drain air and tighten. Repeat process until no air is found.Monitor the brake bleeder screw hose, and close the screw when a steady stream of fluid with no bubbles comes out. Remove the hose and container.

,, While pressing the wheel firmly and evenly against the rotor, spin the lug nuts onto the studs ""snug tight"". It is not required to have the lug nuts fully tight at this point. The next step will complete this process.

, Fully tighten lug nuts to appropriate torque specifications with the tire in contact with the ground. Tighten lug nuts in a ""star"" pattern; do not tighten adjacent lug nuts in a circular ""one after the other"" pattern.

, Remove any spilled fluid from painted surfaces quickly as the finish can be damaged if allowed to sit for even a short time.

,, Perform brake testing at low speeds away from people and buildings if at all possible. Gradually increase speed for testing.

Pay attention if your ride begins to feel rougher.,
Take note if your vehicle pulls or squeaks during turns.,
Inspect the tread wear on your tires.,
Try braking abruptly to see if the nose dives as you stop.,
Look to see if the vehicle sits level.,
Pay attention to swaying and bouncing at low speeds.",How to Inspect Your Suspension System1," Over time, components of your suspension can wear out. While visually inspecting components can often let you know if they’ve become compromised, the easiest way to determine if you are having a suspension issue is by paying attention to how the ride in your vehicle feels. If it has become progressively rougher, it is likely because the suspension is no longer absorbing the bumps the way it is supposed to.If you begin to feel more bumps and shakes as you drive, there may be an issue with your suspension.
Sometimes a rougher ride will come coupled with audible squeaks as the suspension struggles to manage bumps in the road.;
, If you begin to feel as though the vehicle is working against you as you turn, it is likely the result of a failing suspension component. Different parts of your suspension can affect the steering response, angle of the tires, and the center of balance of the vehicle. Each of these elements can make your vehicle cumbersome or difficult to turn. A bad tie rod end will make steering response sluggish. If you’re an audible creek while turning the wheel, it may be the result of a bad lower ball joint. Conversely, if you hear knocking as the weight transfers in the vehicle during a turn, it may be caused by a bad sway bar end link.Pay attention to how the vehicle reacts as you turn and compare it to your previous experiences in the vehicle to assess if there is an issue.
Listen carefully to see if components of your suspension are squeaking under pressure.
Every vehicle behaves a little differently while turning, so previous experiences with the vehicle can make assessing issues much easier.

, Your tires should wear fairly evenly across the width of the tread. If you rotate your tires regularly, they should be worn close to evenly throughout. If you happen to notice the inside or outside of the tire is wearing at a faster rate than the rest, it could be an issue with the camber of your wheels and tires. Camber is the term used to describe the angle the wheel sits in relation to the vehicle and road.A vehicle with negative camber will wear the inside of the tires more quickly.
A vehicle with positive camber will wear the outsides of the tires more quickly.
Camber is determined by your suspension components and wheel alignment.

, If you are having issues with your front struts or shocks, your suspension may struggle to keep the vehicle level under hard braking. Stop quickly in a safe area and pay attention to the front of your car. If the nose of the vehicle dives or drops as you slow down, it may be as result of bad shocks or struts. If you can hear an audible clunk from the front of the vehicle as you brake, there is either an issue with your control arm or sub frame bushing.Your suspension should be able to support the weight of your vehicle and keep it fairly level during most situations.
The front corner of your vehicle may also drop as you turn in the same direction. This is caused by the same failure.

, With the vehicle parked, walk around it and visually assess how level it seems to be sitting. If one side of the car rests higher than the other, there are likely worn out or broken suspension components to blame.It is not uncommon for the front of the vehicle to ride slightly lower than the rear in many vehicles such as pickup trucks, but the vehicle should otherwise be level.

, Your vehicle should have no difficulty withstanding bumps in the road at low speeds. If you go over a bump and feel your vehicle sway back and forth or bounce after passing the bump, your suspension is struggling to support the weight of the vehicle.Your vehicle should be able to go over a bump and quickly regain composure at low speeds.
If your vehicle sways back and forth after going over a bump, there is likely an issue with your suspension.

Park on a clear, flat surface.,
Remove valve caps.,
Determine the optimal pressure for your tires.,
Check tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge.,
Attach your pump to the tire valve.,
Pump up your tire.,
Adjust tire pressure as necessary.,
Inflate the remaining tires.,
Avoid using gauges attached to air compressors.,
Verify the pump is securely fastened.,
Inspect the hose of your pump for leaks.",How to Inflate a Car Tire with a Bike Pump," A clear parking area will allow you to freely move around your car to fill up tires without anything getting in the way. Parking on a level surface will make it easier for you to balance and operate your pump.


If you don't have a suitable clear, flat surface at home, you might park in the street or a neighbor's driveway.
Driving on tires that are flat can damage your tire or deform the rims of your wheels, causing expensive damage. Drive as little as possible on flat tires.;
, The valve cap for each tire will be on the sidewall of the tire, positioned closely to the metal of the wheel's rim. Generally, these caps are screw-on. Unscrew the valve caps for all tires.Valve caps are small and easy to lose. To prevent yours from getting lost, keep them in a sealable container, like a plastic baggie or a lidded plastic container.

, This value will be in PSI (pounds per square inches). The recommended tire pressure for your vehicle is generally written on a sticker inside of the driver's door. Open this door and inspect it for a tag indicating the ideal air pressure.If you can't find the tire pressure information on your door, or if the information is unreadable, tire pressure information can be found in your car's manual.
In the rare case that you lack both the tire pressure door sticker and your car's manual, you can look up the optimal air pressure for your car and tire online.
For some vehicles, the recommended tire pressure for front and back tires may be different., Wait for three hours after driving for the most accurate reading.Inspect the tire pressure gauge and tire valve to make sure these are free of dirt or grit. This can sometimes get caught in a valve, making it leak, difficult to pump, or difficult to take a pressure reading. Take your gauge and:


Position it on top of the stem the tire valve. Press the gauge into the valve firmly until the sound of escaping air ceases, then release.
Look at the reading on your gauge. Many common gauges have a slide reader that pops out of the base of your gauge after taking the reading.
Compare this reading to the recommended PSI to determine whether your tire needs air. Repeat this for all tires on your vehicle., Take your bike pump and position its valve end over the valve of the tire you are pumping. The lever on the back of the valve should be touching the hose in the unlocked position. Press the pump valve firmly onto the tire valve, then raise the lever to lock the pump onto the tire valve.


When attaching your pump to the tire, you'll likely hear air escaping. This is completely natural when locking your bike pump valve in place.
A Shrader valve generally has a stem, at the end of which is threading for a screw on cap. Inside the end of the stem, you should see a small metal pin.
Presta valves, the second most common valve used for bike pumps, will have a thin, threaded cylinder of metal extending from the stem.
Many bike pumps come equipped with a Shrader valve, which is also called an American valve.This part is necessary for pumping up your car tires.

, Raise and lower the pump bar of your bike pump steadily. At regular intervals, check your tire pressure. Overfilling your tires can cause strain on the tire and compromise its integrity.Always follow the manufacturer recommendations for best results, but generally, avoid filling your tires with five PSI more or less than the recommended amount.
A bike pump will move less air at a slower rate than a compressor, which means that this can take quite some time before your tire is filled., In the event you overfilled your tire with air, use your tire pressure gauge or some other tool to press the pin in the center of the tire valve to the side of the valve. This will release air in the tire and decrease pressure.


Check your tire pressure regularly while adjusting. If you release too much pressure, you'll have to pump again.Be precise when filling your tires with air. Filling tires with unequal amounts of air will cause them to wear out more quickly, negatively impact fuel economy, and more., In the fashion described, move from tire to tire, checking tire pressure, inflating, and adjusting each until all tires are the same pressure. When all tires are complete, take your valve caps from their container and reattach them., In a pinch, these kinds of gauges can give you a rough idea of the air pressure of your tires. However, these are often inaccurate and wear out easily, so a separate tire pressure gauge is best.


Tire pressure gauges are relatively inexpensive and small. Put one in the glove box of your car so you always have one on hand., Sometimes, the pump valve and the tire valve will seat poorly, creating gaps where air can escape. This can decrease the amount of air you pump into the tire with each pump.


In especially bad cases, a poor seal between valves can cause the tire to deflate faster than you are inflating it.
Most poorly seated valves can be corrected by removing the pump valve and reattaching it again.

, Bike pumps have a fairly long shelf life, but the hose of older pumps can break down over time. Cracks in it can result in more air being pumped outside the tire than what makes it inside.


Frequently, corroded or cracked hosing can be identified by sight or with a touch check. If you feel cracks, holes, or disintegrating hose, your hose may have a leak.

Visually inspect your strut mounts or shock towers.,
Measure the ride height on your front wheels.,
Jack up the vehicle.,
Visually inspect grease boots and rubber bushings for signs of damage.,
Check for excess play in the tie rod ends.",How to Inspect Your Suspension System2," Open the hood of your vehicle and look to either side. The struts or shock towers will extend through the fender above each wheel and be secured with one or a series of bolts or nuts. Look the fasteners over and ensure they are not covered in rust, and are not loose or otherwise compromised.If your strut mounts or shock towers are not properly secured, they cannot function properly.
Rust can compromise the nuts and bolts holding parts in place as well as the parts themselves.

, Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the length of empty space between the top of the tire and the bottom of the fender well on the driver’s side of your vehicle. Repeat the process on the passenger side and assess if there is a difference. While a slight variation is okay (a half inch or less) the two should be fairly equal.If they are not even, the side that is lower is probably where the issue lies.
If they are even, there still may be an issue with the suspension that affects both sides equally.

, You will need to get under the vehicle to visually inspect the condition of your suspension system. Place a trolley or scissor jack beneath the vehicle at one of its designated jack points for the front end. If you are unsure of where to locate your vehicle’s jack points, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for clarification. Jack up the car until it’s high enough to work beneath, then place jack stands beneath the car to support its weight before beginning your visual inspection.Never work beneath a vehicle that is supported by a jack without jack stands.

, Once you are beneath your vehicle, start at one wheel and look around at the rubber bushings separating metal components of your suspension from one another. They are usually black, though they may fade into grey over time. There may be as many as forty individual bushings between components of your suspension, though they are often round with a hole in the middle (like a doughnut). Any time you find a piece of rubber in your suspension, it is considered a bushing. If you notice cracks or tears in any bushings, they will need to be replaced.Once a rubber bushing begins to wear out, it will allow more movement between suspension components than should be permitted, resulting in altered suspension dynamics and likely making your ride rougher.
Torn or missing bushings can seriously compromise your vehicle’s ability to withstand bumps or even steer.
Common bushing failures in your suspension may include sway bar end links (at each end of the sway bar), trail arm bushings a the axle pivot point on the vehicle, or the bushings in the upper or lower control arms.

, Locate the power steering box and follow its arms toward the wheels. If you are unsure where the power steering box is located in your vehicle, refer to the service manual specific to the year, make and model of your car or truck. Tie rod ends serve as the connection points between the steering box and the wheels, so if the bushings become compromised it could result in dead spots in your steering and reduced handling ability.If you have noticed a “dead spot” in your steering wheel, it is likely the result of having too much play caused by a bad tie rod end.
A completely failed tie rod end can be extremely dangerous, as it can prevent you from being able to control the vehicle. Replace tie rod ends before they become so worn out they fail completely.

"
"
Jack up the rear of the car.,
Wipe each joint clean and inspect the bushings for damage.,
Inspect bolts and nuts for rust and tightness.,
Inspect one wheel at a time with an independent rear suspension.",How to Inspect Your Suspension System3," Locate the rear jack points for your vehicle and place a jack beneath it. If the front of your vehicle is resting on jack stands, you may leave it in the air, but if you only have two jack stands you should lower the front end of the vehicle and use those stands to support the rear of it while you work.While the vehicle’s front wheels don’t have to be on the ground to inspect the rear suspension, you must place jack stands beneath the rear in order to climb under the vehicle.
If the front tires are on the ground, place a wheel chock in front of them to ensure the vehicle can’t shift forward while you jack it up or once it is on the jack stands.

, The rear suspension has far fewer components than the front, but they need to be inspected for the same signs of damage. It is likely that a lot of mud and debris has gotten trapped by the rear suspension, so you may need to wipe the bushings off with some water and a rag to be able to properly inspect them.There is no need to wipe the joints and bushings down if you can easily see them.
Look for the same signs of cracking or tearing in the rubber bushings.

, Check the nuts and bolts used to secure components of the suspension to one another and the vehicle for signs of excessive rust and to make sure they are tight. Use a screw driver to poke at the fastening hardware that appears rusty. If bits of the rusted nut or bolt comes off as you poke at it, the hardware will need to be replaced.If you notice any of the nuts or bolts have become loose over time, use an appropriate hand or socket wrench to tighten them again.
If portions of the frame or the suspension components themselves are too rusted, you will need to take the vehicle to a mechanic to have it repaired.

, If your vehicle came equipped with an independent rear suspension, you will need to jack up each side of the vehicle to inspect the suspension on that side. Although you may not need to with some vehicle, you should anticipate needing to remove the wheel and tire in order to access and inspect the suspension components.Inspect an independent rear suspension by looking for signs of damage on the bushings or excess rust on the fastening hardware or suspension components.
Suspension components are designed to support the weight of the vehicle under load, so you should not be able to move any by hand. If you can move a component by hand, it is either too loose or the bushing has gone bad.

"
"
Park your vehicle on firm, even ground.,
Push down firmly on the front of the vehicle.,
Count how many bounces the suspension needs to recover.,
Repeat the test on the rear of the vehicle.",How to Inspect Your Suspension System4," In order to conduct a bounce test you need to remove any variables that could affect how the vehicle recovers from being bounced. Soft or uneven ground can affect how the vehicle sits, giving you a less reliable outcome.Blacktop or concrete are the preferred surfaces to conduct this test on.
An uneven surface will shift the weight of the vehicle, causing the suspension to respond differently than it would otherwise.

, The bounce test requires that you compress the suspension of the vehicle and assess how it recovers. In order to do so, place both of your palms on a stable part of the front of the vehicle (the hood will suffice) and press down with all of your weight. Take your hands away and watch the vehicle as it rises again.Press on the hood near the very front of the car to prevent putting a dent in it.
If you are unable to put enough pressure on the vehicle to compress the suspension, ask a friend to help.

, After releasing the vehicle, it should bounce back up and right itself in a single bounce. If it bounces a few more times as it settles, the shock absorbers in the front of your vehicle are likely bad.Even if you push down on the hood several times before releasing it, it should still right itself with only one bounce.

, Once you have assessed the front suspension, move to the rear of the vehicle and repeat the process by pressing down on the trunk lid. Like the front, the rear suspension should be able to right itself after a single bounce.If the vehicle bounces a few times before settling again, take it to a professional to have the shock absorbers looked at.
Do not press down on spoilers or fins, as they are often made of fiberglass and will break under pressure.

Decide which brand of tire you want.,
Do your homework.,
Try not to accept the first offer.,
Be polite.,
Get quotes from other dealers before stepping into the store.,
Always consider buying from an online tire store.,Check comparisons on reputable websites like ""safercar.gov""

,
Consider carefully the lifespan of tires.",How to Get a Good Deal on Tires," A specific brand dealer will be able to get you a much better price on the brand his store is owned by, because he gets them direct from the factory. When you try to get a brand different from the one the dealer has, he buys them from a tire wholesaler, and then marks them up 20% to 30%. Many companies have stopped selling direct to dealers and department stores, instead marketing their tires through a larger wholesaler and controlling the price level by having dealers join an alliance program.


Big-box stores such as Sears and Walmart, and warehouse stores such as Costco and Sam's Club, often have low but probably non-negotiable prices on tires.;
, Know which tire you want when you walk in. They will be pushing their top-of-the-line tire at the moment because the salespeople get more commission per tire on those.


Also have a second and even a third choice as a backup to your first choice. You may be able to get a better tire for a lesser price today

, Tires are marked up, and most salespeople will work out the quote with the suggested retail price. This can be anywhere from $5 to $50 over store cost per tire. Make sure the quote includes installation and balance., A common sentiment among salespeople is that ""Discounts vary upon customer attitude.""

, The best way to do this is call and ask for prices on the tires that you have decided to purchase. They will try to sell you another brand that they claim is a better deal (which is sometimes true). Getting quotes from multiple dealers will help you determine when dealers are being honest and when they are simply out for more money.

, You may find a better deal than any brick and mortar store, even after you add shipping charges. This is especially true for less popular brands of tires and/or high-performance tires.


Online stores will often ship the tires directly to a mechanic of your choice, who will perform the actual installation.
Online stores such as Tire Rack will often provide numerous reviews of different kinds of tires and ratings of various aspects of their performance such as ride, wet and dry traction, fuel consumption, and longevity.
TireRack.com will also give you prices for local tire installers (go to the installation section).
Remember that installation and balancing is an additional cost.
Any warranty claims are with the online retailer and not the installer.

,, Bear in mind that a tire that lasts twice as long will cost half as much to buy and half as much to have mounted, have the old tire disposed, etc.

Start with maintaining a safe driving speed; there are just no two sides to this.,
Do not slam on the brake pedal.,
Don’t abruptly take your foot off the accelerator.,
Try your best to keep the vehicle pointed straight.,
Do not attempt to over-correct.,
Allow the vehicle to gradually coast to a stop.",How to Handle a Tyre Burst," The lower your speed, the higher your chance of survival. A blowout at 80–90 km/h (50–56 mph) will be far less dramatic than one at 140–150 km/h (87–93 mph). Indeed, if you survive a tire burst at 150 km/h (93 mph), consider it a gift of God.;
, Of course, this is easier said than done, as our brains are hardwired to instinctively jam the brake pedal in an emergency. Hard braking is actually the worst thing you can do as it will further imbalance the vehicle and throw it out of control.

, Do it slowly and gradually. In fact, Michelin recommends that you maintain accelerator input momentarily, before releasing it slowly. The deceleration force from a blown tire is so strong that your car will anyway slow down rapidly. If you have engaged cruise control, be sure to disengage it immediately.

, Cornering or turning with a blown tire will greatly upset the car’s composure. If your car is pulling to one side, you might need to pull the steering in the opposite direction to keep it going straight. This is critical, else you risk drifting into the road divider or worse still, the opposite lane.

, The key is to maintain the vehicle’s stability. A sharp yank of the steering wheel can result in a rollover. Even when you have gained control and are slowly moving to a safe parking spot, do so with the mildest steering inputs possible.

, Use engine braking if necessary. Lightly engage the brakes only when your car has decelerated to a slow speed. Use the turn indicators and pull over safely off the road. Drive on the bare metal wheel if you have to, but do not stop in the middle of the road as you run the risk of getting rear-ended by a speeding car. Remember to activate your hazard lights when stopped.

Repeat the process for each tire.",How to Fill Air in a Car's Tires," Look for the tool at an auto-parts store – something like NAPA, AutoZone, Checker, Kragen, O'Reilly, or Canadian Tire. Pocket gauges are inexpensive and portable. Prices range from $5 for a basic gauge to more than $30 for one that is digital, has an air-release button, or even talks.There are two types of pocket gauge: dial-type and pencil-type.









The pencil type is long, slender, and metallic, about the size of a pencil. It contains a graduated sliding extension that is forced out of the sleeve by air pressure when attached to the tire stem.
The dial type has a similar fitting to the pencil type, but it includes a graduated gauge and needle.;
, Find the small rubber or metal valve stem along the inside rim of your wheel, and unscrew it to reveal the air valve. Press the open end of the pressure gauge into the air valve. Hold it there, steadily and firmly, and listen for a light rushing sound as the gauge reads the pressure from the force of the air. After a few moments, pull the gauge away from the tire and read the pressure from the small screen on the side of the device.








, Car tire pressures usually range from 30-35 psi (pounds per square inch), although light trucks often require a higher pressure.Some vehicles need the same amount of pressure in every tire, but others will have different values for front and rear tires. Tires naturally tend to deflate about 1 psi each month. You should check your tire pressures monthly at a minimum, since ambient temperature affects tire psi. This is a good way to catch a slow leak. It is a good idea to check your tires pressures when you fill up with gas. Rather than standing by the pump, grab your tire pressure gauge and check your tire pressure. Be sure to check the air pressure in your spare twice a year, otherwise it will also be flat when you need it.









Consult your car's manual or your driver-side doorpost for the recommended tire pressures. The label will have a recommended tire psi or kpa (kilopascal) number.
If your tire is outright flat, then it may have a leak. Try adding air to the tire and see if it holds air. If the tire holds air, drive on if for a short while and recheck the tire pressure. If the pressure drops, the tire has a slow leak and should be taken to a tire store to have the leak repaired. If you can hear air escaping while adding air, it is time to install the spare tire. If more than one tire has blown out, then you may need to call a tow truck.

, You'll want to screw these back on later, so set them to the side or put them into your pocket. Consider leaving each stem cap on its valve until you are about to pump that tire – this way, the caps will spend most of their time in the right place, and you won't have to worry so much about losing them.








, Automatic air compressors are more expensive, but much faster. You can use a manual floor pump, like a bicycle pump, but it will take much longer and it'll be much more labor-intensive. You can buy your own air pump, or find a friend who owns one – but if not, most gas stations host a stand of coin-operated air and water pumps.









If you use a bicycle pump, make sure that it is schrader-valve compatible. Consider asking someone to help you pump so that you don't need to do it all yourself. Car tires are much larger than bicycle tires!
You can purchase an air pump that plugs into the car's 12v outlet at the auto parts store when you purchase a tire pressure gauge.

, This means that first thing in the morning or you've driven less than 2 miles (3.2 km) on them since they went flat. If you've driven more than a mile or two, your pressure-gauge readings will be inaccurate.








, It's usually located on the outskirts of the gas station's parking lot – somewhere out of the way of the gas pumps. If you don't see it, ask the attendant. Pull your car alongside the air dispenser and find the coin slot. Pump prices range from a few cents to as much as a dollar (for a few minutes).









Pull your car in close enough that the pump hose can reach all four tires. This is less important if you only intend to fill one or two tires.
Check your tire pressure while filling up with fuel. Most gas stations that charge for air will waive your tire-pump fee if you've already bought gas. You may need to go inside and speak with and present the gas receipt to the station attendant.

, If you are at a gas station, turn on the pump by feeding the machine the requisite amount of coins. You should hear a loud rumbling and humming noise when the pump is running. Stretch the air hose around to your closest tire (or to the tire in need of filling) and press the tip of the pump to the tip of the air valve. Hold it there, firmly and steadily, and listen to the rush of air as the pump fills the tire.









If you hear a wild spraying of air, try to steady the pump. There's a good chance that the tip of the hose is not flush against the valve.

, If your tires are low on pressure, it may take you several minutes of continuous pumping to fill each tire. If you've filled your tires within the past few months, and you're just topping them off, the process might last as little as 10-20 seconds. Consider using a hand pump for these small top-offs if you are wary of spending money on a full coin-operated machine.








, When you think that you've added enough air, pull the hose away and use your pressure gauge to read the pressure. Again, most tires should be 30-35 psi – but check the specifications for your car to be sure. Add air if the reading is lower than it should be, and release air if the reading is higher than it should be. When you've reached the proper pressure, you're done adding air to the tire.









To release air from the tire, depress the center pin of the valve stem with a fingernail or a tool. You should hear a steady hiss as compressed air jets forth from the over-inflated tire. Release the air in small increments so as not to release too much air, checking the tire pressure often while lowering the tire pressure.
Make sure to inflate your tires to the suggested pressure, even if they're only low by one or two psi units. It's estimated that for every 3 psi below the specified amount, you burn one percent more fuel. You may also suffer up to 10 percent more tire wear., When you're done adding air to each tire, make sure to replace the stem cap. It is not essential that you seal up the valve, but it will make your tire less likely to lose air. The valve should not release air unless anything depresses it – a twig, a finger, or any stray object.








, If the hose won't reach, then feel free to move the car closer or turn it around. Keep in mind, however, that each pump session only runs for a limited time – so you'll need to be quick if you don't want to pay for another go!

, This will allow time for any leaks that may be present to drip onto your material.

, Note the location of any spots in relation to the car's tires. Knowing this can narrow down possible leaks.

, The fluids in your car are all different. They also have different colors and textures.


If you notice light brown or black stains that are of medium consistency you are leaking oil. A few drops is normal, but anything larger should be investigated.
Reddish, light brown, or black stains that are near the center of the car is usually transmission fluid.
If the color is similar to the transmission fluid, but is located in the front of the car, it is your power steering fluid.
Finding a pale brownish stain that is very slippery would indicate a brake fluid leak.
A spot of brightly colored fluid is antifreeze. Coolant comes in a variety of colors including green, red and yellow.

, Unscrew your valve cap. You will put the sealant in the same way that you would inflate your tire with air.

, Once you have it on securely, press a button to release the contents.

, You need to drive your car to rotate the tire. This allows the sealant to be distributed evenly inside the tire and prevents it from forming a heavy lump inside the tire.

, Tire sealants are great to bail you out in a major crisis. Unfortunately they are only good for 3 days or 100 miles, whichever comes first. You should replace your tire before then to avoid possible problems."

, Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:


Your service manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack, or trolley jack. If you are unsure how to use one visit Lift a Car Using a Trolley Jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car. A good tutorial on jack stands can be found at Use Jack Stands.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.

, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. If you are uncomfortable removing a wheel, read about how to Remove Lug Nuts and Tires.

, It is also good practice to mark the spot with chalk or markers.


When there's no protruding item, follow the above steps for locating a leak.

, This is done by inserting the tool in and out of the hole quickly. This also roughens the area so the fix will hold., Both of these pieces can be found in your tire repair kit. This is sometimes difficult and requires squeezing down one end to make it fit though the hole first., There should be roughly ½” of plug protruding from the tire.

If your kit came with an adhesive, such as rubber cement or glue, apply it to the plug before inserting. This will lubricate the plug, making it easier to push in. The adhesive will also promote a better seal., Before doing this, you should let any adhesives used dry for at least one minute.

, Use a tire gauge to check that the tire is at the manufacturer recommended air pressure.

, This will allow you to check the seal to make sure it is holding. If it isn't holding, add a little cement or retry using another plug.

, You should slide the wheel back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheel in place while the car is still on the jackstands.

, Use the floor jack to lift the vehicle off of the jackstands. Remove the jackstands and lower the vehicle with the floor jack.

, Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual. Be sure to tighten lugs in a star pattern.

, While a plug can provide more stability than tire sealants, it is not a forever solution. It is suggested that you replace the tire within the next 20,000 miles."

Determine the severity of the leak.,
Fix the leak yourself.,
Take your vehicle to a professional.",How to Find a Leak in a Tire4," Some leaks can be repaired, but leaks on the shoulder or sidewall of the tire should never be repaired. If you have a puncture in the tread area that is less than 1/4"" in diameter then a repair may be your best option. If you are unsure of whether to replace or repair the tire consult a professional., Some people prefer to fix leaks on their own. To do this you can patch your tire, or for smaller leaks you can use a tire sealant such as Fix-A-Flat for a temporary fix.

, If you aren't able to fix the leak yourself you should take it to a professional tire shop. If it is a slow leak it may be safe for you to pump the tire up and drive to the shop. Otherwise, it may be necessary to have your car towed to the tire shop.

Keep the dispenser in your tank for as long as possible.",How to Get Free Gas1," Some pumps don't give you what you pay for. If you want to get free gas, it's important to make sure that the gas you are paying for matches up with what is advertised. Sometimes the pumps can be miscalibrated, and if they are, you can get some extra gas for free.Try filling up a container you're sure of the dimensions of, like a gas can, instead of your tank. Use a calculator quickly to make sure that the price that you're paying matches the amount that went in. If it doesn't, go in and ask for a refund, or for extra gas.
If you find a pump in your town that's reliably wonky, keep going back to it and complaining every time it messes up. Print your receipts every time and double-check.;
, At some pumps, even newer multi-pump dispensers, you can take the nozzle out of the dispenser with one hand and grip the hose 2-3 feet above the nozzle with your other hand, and shake firmly downward, as if you were cracking a whip. A small amount of gas will squirt from the nozzle every time you do this, and it won't show up on the counter.


Warning: This can be extremely dangerous, resulting in damage to the dispenser or personal injury. It's also a good way to get you into trouble and a super-inefficient way to fill your tank.

, Often, a little gas will keep coming after you cut off the flow. Shake the hose gently and get the rest of the gas out of it and into the tank. It won't be like getting a full tank for free, but you'll be getting a little extra than what you paid for.

This is especially important for clothing that's very saturated in gasoline, as it can be a hazard to wash gasoline-soaked clothing in a washing machine.If you don't have a hose, you can rinse clothing under a faucet.;
, Find a place to hang the clothes up outside, such as a balcony or clothesline. Hang the clothing on the line and let it air outdoors for 24 hours.Check the forecast. If it's going to rain, wait until the weather clears up to treat your clothing.
If you absolutely cannot hang the clothing outdoors, a well-ventilated room in your home should do the trick. Hang the clothes there until they're dry.

, Before throwing your clothing in a washing machine, pick up some mechanic's hand soap at a hardware or department store. Use this to lather any particularly oily or greasy spots before throwing your clothes in the washer.Look for mechanic's soap that has lanolin listed on the ingredients label for the best results.

, Do not put any other clothing in the washing machine with gasoline-soaked clothing. This could cause other clothing to absorb the smell of gasoline or become stained., Look at your clothes' manufacturer's label. To best treat the smell of gasoline, you should use the highest heat setting the clothes can tolerate.If you're unsure how high of a heat setting your clothes can tolerate, search the fabric type online and look at washing guidelines.

, You can purchase ammonia at most supermarkets and hardware stores. Add a quarter cup of ammonia and a little extra detergent to the laundry. This should help wash out the gasoline smell., Do not place your clothing in the dryer after washing it. Instead, hang your clothing to dry outside or on a drying rack. It's very dangerous to put clothing that's been soaked with gasoline in the dryer, as gasoline is combustible., If there are stains on your clothing, they may harbor a smell. Before attempting to wash out the stains, sprinkle baking powder or coffee grounds on the stains. This will help neutralize the odor. Let the coffee grounds or baking soda sit on the stain for a few hours before brushing them off and washing the stain., Liquid dishwashing detergent that's made to target grease can help remove gasoline stains. Gently rub the detergent into the stains until they lift. Then, rinse the garment and wash it in the washing machine as usual.Remember you should always hang-dry clothing that came into contact with gasoline.

, Baby oil can also help lift gasoline stains. You can pour baby oil directly on the stains and rub the stains out. You can also toss rags soaked with baby oil into the washing machine with your gasoline-stained clothes., Unfortunately, sometimes the gasoline smell remains on your clothes despite your best efforts. While this can be frustrating, professional services can help. If you can't get stains or smell out of your clothes at home, contact a local dry cleaner. You can find dry cleaners online. If your clothing has been very stained or damaged by gasoline, professional dry cleaning services may help treat your clothes.

Make sure the fluid is warm.,
Turn the engine back off.,
Remove the power steering cap by turning it counter-clockwise.,
Track down your master cylinder (brakes) reservoir.,
Check your windshield washer tank.",How to Know if Your Car Has a Fluid Leak2," The manual should also tell you how much of each fluid you need, and the type of antifreeze your car uses.


If one of the warning lights is lit on your dashboard, you can check the manual for what the light indicates (usually oil or coolant). When one of these lights are on, it is a sign that a leak is possible.

, If you are pointing uphill or downhill the fluid in your tanks may read more or less than is actually there. It is important to check fluids on level ground.

, In many vehicles it usually has a yellow handle. If you have difficulty locating the dipstick, look in your owner's manual.


Pull out the dipstick, wipe it off with a paper towel or rag, and reinsert it. Pull the dipstick out again and examine it horizontally. There are two indicator marks, one is the top level and the other the lower level. The amount of oil should be between these two marks.Wipe off the dipstick with a towel and place it back into the reservoir tank if it is at a normal level. If it isn't between the two lines, this indicates a possible oil leak.

, Do this when your engine is cold, and look to see if the fluid level is between the hot and cold marks on the tank.Sometimes you may have to take off the radiator cap to see clearly, depending on the color of your tank. If the fluid is below the cold line or is completely empty, you definitely have an antifreeze leak.

, This is the reservoir for your power steering fluid.

, Let your engine run at idling speed for a few minutes and turn the steering wheel back and forth several times.

, This should be done before proceeding to checking your fluid levels.

, The dipstick is usually built into the cap with an indicator mark. If the liquid is below this mark or there's none on the stick, then you may have a leak.

, There should be a marker line on the side of the reservoir. If you cannot see the fluid clearly, you can unscrew the cap and look inside.


If the fluid is very low or gone, you have a leak. It is normal to have a slight decrease in fluid if your brake pads are worn down. If you think this is the case, add fluid up to the fill line and monitor it for the next several days. If the amount of fluid changes you have a leak, otherwise you can assume that it was normal wearing of the brake pads.

, Most tanks are transparent so you can see the fluid level easily. If you have a different type, consult your owner's manual for instructions.


Since you deplete your washer fluid more frequently, it can be difficult to detect a leak, but if you just filled it a week before and it is very low or empty, you probably have a leak.

However, some agencies will make exceptions, especially if you live near a university or areas with high pedestrian activity.Other requirements include having a late-model vehicle in good repair, a clean driving record and valid insurance. You may get a bonus, or qualify for special advertising, if you drive a specialty vehicle or have an occupation, such as pizza delivery, that requires you to drive long distances every day., Ever notice that you've never seen a patrol car filling up at a gas station? That's because police officers in metropolitan areas usually get to fill up for free at specific guarded locations. This only applies to the unit cars, not their daily drivers, but it's an effective way at getting gas for free and getting around town on the city's dime.


Other jobs that let you use vehicles with gas in them include parks departments and other city jobs. You usually don't have to pay for gas, or you'll be reimbursed after the fact.

, Carpooling can be a great way of getting someone else to spring for the gas. If you give someone a ride somewhere, ask if they wouldn't mind springing for a little extra in the tank, or giving you some cash to help cover it. Totally fair request.


Some state and local governments also offer gas cards as an incentive for carpooling.Sometimes, the offers will be for other kinds of bonuses, like gift cards to restaurants or coffee shops. Still, free stuff!

, If you're traveling and need a car, you can sometimes get a little in the tank for free. Some rental companies offer a free tank of gas with select rentals, or as a part of other offers. If you don't have a strong opinion about what car you drive, or are willing to negotiate, you might luck out.

, You can usually redeem reward points for gift cards at the merchant of your choice, which sometimes includes gas stations, or fillable gas cards that will come with some money already loaded on. These can be a great and hassle free way of getting some extra gas at the pump.

, Some banks offer free gas as an incentive to draw new members. Keep an eye out for these kinds of offers and try signing up for a new savings account to keep all the money you're saving at the pump.


Research the terms and conditions of opening an account with that bank before you march in and ask for your gas card. In some cases, you may be required to maintain a minimum balance, or you may be charged a maintenance fee for keeping the account open.

Look at the difference in sulfur between the two fuel types.,
Know that you can now find ultra-low sulfur diesel at most all highway diesel fuel pumping locations.,
Recognize the difference in appearance in ultra-low sulfur diesel and LSD.,
Realize that there is a cost difference between ultra-low sulfur diesel and when LSD was available.,
Know that you might see a slight reduction in fuel economy because the same process that takes out the sulfur also reduces your fuel's energy content.,
Watch for performance issues during the transition.,
Look at lubricity.",How to Compare ULSD and LSD Auto Fuels," ultra-low sulfur diesel is considered a cleaner burning type of diesel fuel because it has 97 percent less sulfur, which allows pollution control devices that used to be damaged by sulfur to be used more effectively to reduce emissions from the vehicle.;
, The year 2010 was the cut year for retailers to sell LSD, so the conversion should be fully implemented to strictly selling ultra-low sulfur diesel.

, ultra-low sulfur dieselD typically has a lighter appearance because of the refining process that was used to take out the sulfur. Because of the reduction in sulfur, it also tends to have less of an odor as compared to LSD.

, The refinement and distribution cost is more for ultra-low sulfur diesel than it was for LSD, so you should expect to pay more at the pump. Factors in this price increase include transportation costs, crude oil prices, weather factors and economic factors.

, You should, however, see no impact on your overall power when putting ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel in your vehicle instead of LSD fuel.

, When first introducing ultra-low sulfur diesel to your vehicle, you might loosen fuel tank deposits, so monitor your vehicle closely for plugged filters during your change over from LSD.

, While the higher sulfur content may have given your vehicle good lubricity, you should see no difference between ultra-low sulfur diesel and LSD because typically additives that both inhibit corrosion and increase lubricity are put in prior to the fuel being sold at a retail level. Additives such as these should give you performance as good as LSD fuel.

Check your owner's manual for the recommended power steering flush schedule.,
Check your power steering fluid reservoir monthly to check for leaks.,
Check the color and consistency of your power steering fluid.,
Bring your car to the mechanic if you hear a whining or moaning noise when turning.",How to Flush Power Steering Fluid1," Your power steering system is actually remarkable at staying clean. That said, over time natural wear and tear will cause bits of rubber, plastic, and dirt to enter the fluid, and this can cause problems to the entire system if the fluid is not flushed. Each car has it's own suggested interval after which you should change the fluid, so look up your model's time frame.


For high-end cars, you should consider replacing the fluid every 35-40 thousand miles.;
, Your power steering fluid level should barely change from month to month. If it is changing, then you likely have a leak and should bring your car to an auto shop as soon as possible.Your reservoir usually has a labeled cap or a picture of a steering wheel. If you are having trouble locating this semi-transparent plastic tank, check your owner's manual.

, Open the reservoir and use a flashlight to peer down into the fluid. The consistency, color, and smell will tell you whether or not you need to change your fluid:



Flush your fluid if it smells burnt, looks dark brown or black, and/or has shiny, metallic bits in it.Refresh you fluid if it is darkly colored, your owner's manual recommends it, and/or if you do frequent towing or high-weight driving.

Your fluid is fine if is is lightly colored, dark without metallic bits or chunks, or was replaced in the last two to three years., This could be the sign of more serious, and expensive, power steering problems. The sooner you take care of the issue, the easier and cheaper the repair will be."

Take a mental note daily of the gas prices as you drive throughout your local area.,
Call and talk to your friends who drive past other fuel stations in the area.,
Fill up in the morning or late at night since gas will condense in the tank with the cooler temperatures.,
Pay attention to local news and radio reports to learn about any gas or fuel promotions in your area.,
Use the Internet to locate the best gas prices in your area.,
Fill up the tank before you hit empty.",How to Find the Best Gas Prices," Stop and fill up at the place with the lowest gas price you saw. When traveling long distances, pay attention to the gas prices in various areas so you can have an idea of where to fill up on the way back home.;
, Ask them if they notice a price lower than what you know to be the best price, and visit that location.

, This allows you to get more gas in the tank than if you fill up during the hottest part of the day when the heat expands the gas and causes it to take up more room in the tank. Gas is sold by volume, so you can get more for your money this way.

, Even when prices are on the rise, some companies will reduce the price to make up for the lost money with volume sales.

, There are many websites that list the current gas prices at various stations all over the world.

, This gives you a little freedom as to what price you pay. When you see a good price, top off the tank. When you're on the last few miles or kilometers before the tank is dry, you may have to go to the nearest station regardless of price.

Run the car close to empty, if possible.,
Purchase a fuel siphon system.,
Stick your hose into the gas tank, feeding it until there is only one to two feet left before the pump.,
Pump your hand pump until gas comes out.,
Remove the tube and refill the tank.,
Reuse the gas, or dispose of it properly.",How to Drain the Gas Tank of Your Car1," Unless you have the wrong fuel in the tank, turn the car on and run the gas down towards empty by driving around. Park the car and let it cool before beginning to drain it.


This strategy will decrease the amount of pumping and draining you have to do, and leaves you with less gas to store or dispose of.
Never run a car if you have the wrong fuel in the tank. Draining a full tank will take a long time, but it is not impossible.;
, Sold at most auto stores, these are manually operated pumps that will draw the gas out of your car and into a container. Make sure that you buy one that is approved for combustible materials, as any sparks near your gas tank are a sure recipe for disaster.


You'll need six feet or so of small ⅜ inch hose, as well as a pump to draw the fuel out.The old trick of sticking a hose in the gas tank then sucking out the gas with your mouth is hazardous to your health and incredibly dangerous. You could swallow gasoline or spill enough to create a serious fire hazard.
Have a fire extinguisher specifically for gas fires nearby in case of a fire.
Some vehicles have saddle-type fuel tanks and may require a specialized way of removing the fuel from both sides of the tanks. Seek a professional's help or advice to get all the fuel out.

, This is the hardest part of process, as newer cars sometimes have protective metal bulbs or screens that prevent gas from escaping the car in case of a crash. For older cars you should be able to get the hose right in the tank without hindrance, but you'll need a new strategy for newer models:









Take a separate, smaller tube that is rigid and resists kinking.
Force this tube down until it hits the blockage, then twist, push, and force the tube around the metal bulb blocking entry to the tank. If a reasonable amount of force doesn't succeed, do not continue, as you may puncture the filler tube or cause other damage.
Take your larger tube, the one connected to the pump, and slip it over the smaller tube., As you pump, have your receptacle for gas ready to be filled up. Hold onto the end of the hose, as it can start to move when the gas begins to flow.









If you don't have a pump, but you have a spare tube, stick that in as well. Then, blow into this spare tube, pushing air into the tank, which will then force the gas out of your other tube.

, Your tank is empty, and you're ready to move on with your repairs. If you are working on a gasoline or diesel vehicle that had the wrong fuel put in the tank, you may have to flush out the fuel tank and fuel system with the correct fuel.








, If the gas is not old or unusable you can put it in another car or gasoline engine. If you need to get rid of it you should contact your local environmental waste disposal center. Never pour gas down a drain or sewer. You can often call your local fire department for information on how to dispose of environmental waste safely and effectively.


Check the Yellow Pages under Environmental and Ecological Services and Oils, Waste.
If you plan on reusing the fuel after the repairs are done, make sure you are storing the fuel in approved fuel containers.
You may have to pay to dispose of the gas."

Use diesel fuel if your vehicle is designed for it.,
Understand what an octane rating means.,
Don’t assume higher octane improves performance.,
Check in your vehicle’s owner’s manual.,
Check the automaker’s website.",How to Choose the Right Fuel for Your Car1," Engines designed to run on diesel fuel operate differently than those designed to run on regular gasoline. Diesel engines do not use spark plugs, and instead rely on the compression of the air and fuel to ignite the mixture alone. Because of this, diesel fuel is less stable and cannot be used in engines designed for gasoline. Diesel vehicles usually have clear “diesel only” markings on the inside of their fuel doors, and traditional gas pumps won’t fit in their filler necks.Diesel fuel usually comes in only one grade, so there are no options to choose from.
If you aren’t sure if your vehicle operates on diesel fuel, refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website.;
, Every time you pull up to the pump, you’re presented with a few different options for the octane rating in the gas you put into your engine. Most places offer 87, 89, and 91 octane fuel, while some locations may offer higher octane options at the same or separate pumps. This rating is a measure of the stability of the fuel under compression. Higher octane fuels are more stable and less likely to pre-detonate before the spark plug ignites the air/fuel mixture. Pre-detonation (sometimes called “pinging”) can cause serious damage to your engine.Engines with higher compression ratios require a higher octane fuel to ensure their air/fuel mixture doesn’t pre-detonate.
Most car makers design their engines with a specific octane fuel in mind.

, Higher octane doesn’t necessarily mean better performance. High performance engines often require a higher octane fuel because they utilize much higher compression ratios than most vehicles. The compression ratio is the comparison between the volume of air and fuel that can fit into a cylinder with the piston in the down position and the same volume when the piston is in the up position (or when the air and fuel are compressed). Lower compression engines do not require a high octane fuel and often won’t benefit from its use.You can get the best performance, mileage and emissions under normal driving conditions from using the octane fuel your engine was designed for, not the highest octane available.
The octane rating an engine requires has much more to do with its design than it does with its performance.

, Every engine is designed with a specific octane rating in mind, so the easiest way to know what kind of fuel to use in your car is to refer to the factory owner’s manual. Many economy cars are designed to run best using 87 octane fuel because the automakers understand that a person shopping for an economy car would likely also prefer to use less expensive fuel, while many higher end cars may specifically state that you should use 91 octane. Make sure to use the octane rating specified for your vehicle in order to keep your engine running properly.Some cars will state the required octane rating on your dash board near the fuel gauge.
Cars that require 91 octane often have a reminder printed on the inside of the fuel cap to ensure you use the proper rated fuel.

, If you purchased your vehicle used without an owner’s manual or you’ve misplaced it, you can often find the required octane rating for your vehicle on the automaker’s website. If you are having difficulty locating it, try a simple search query such as, “what is the correct octane fuel for a 1998 Volkswagen Jetta?”Only trust information you find on reputable websites such as the official site for the automaker.
Do not trust information about fuel types you should use that you find on blogs or in forums.

Contact recycling centers for antifreeze disposal locations.,
Identify antifreeze that looks dirty or smells like gas.,
Place tainted and pure waste antifreeze into separate containers.,
Find hazardous waste disposal centers for tainted antifreeze.,
Drive the antifreeze to a recycling facility.",How to Dispose of Antifreeze1," Check with your local government or visit a community recycling day. They may accept pure antifreeze or direct you where to go. Other good places to check are machine shops and oil change shops. Many of them accept antifreeze for recycling. Wastewater management places may also accept small amounts of antifreeze.Search for facilities by searching your city’s website, searching online for mechanics in your area, or calling disposal companies in the area.
There may be a small facility usage fee when recycling antifreeze. These fees will be greater at hazardous waste disposal facilities.;
, Even a drop of oil or gas in antifreeze taints it. This tainted antifreeze is considered hazardous and must be shipped to a different facility than normal used antifreeze. Look at it for signs of muddiness. Normal antifreeze is brightly-colored and smells sweet.Damage to a vehicle can cause fluids to mix. If you aren’t sure, consider the antifreeze polluted.

, Store the antifreeze in containers such as old antifreeze bottles. Make sure these containers are well-sealed. Both types of antifreeze must be shipped to different places, so label them to remember which one is which.

When flushing antifreeze out of a vehicle, use a different drain pan and funnel than you use for oil and other fluids., This antifreeze can’t be recycled. Since it is considered hazardous, only a hazardous waste disposal facility will accept it. Ask your local government. Mechanics at repair shops may also be able to tell you where they dispose of their antifreeze., You can’t ship antifreeze in the mail. You have to bring the container to the facility. A commercial hauler or waste oil service may also do it for you. Once you reach the facility, get a receipt that shows where you delivered the antifreeze.Hiring a commercial hauler for hazardous antifreeze makes the process easier. This is only necessary for shipping large amounts of antifreeze. If you transport it yourself, you will need to provide your own documentation about using the truck.
Always consult your government for disposal regulations.

Lift the vehicle using a jack and assure that the front wheels are raised to a sufficient height, allowing you to slide easily under the car.,
Locate and remove the catch tray under the power steering system.,
Drain the power steering fluid by disconnecting the low-pressure hose from the steering pump at its lowest point.,
Unscrew the cap to the power steering reservoir and add roughly 1/2 the manufacturer's recommended amount of power steering fluid.,
Turn the car on and add more fluid, keeping the reservoir half full.,
Reattach the power steering line after you turn the car off.,
Fill the reservoir up to the recommended level and close it up.,
Start the engine and rotate the steering wheel from one locked position to the other for five minutes.,
Turn the car off and top the reservoir with more fluid.,
Verify that the steering wheel is operating properly when the vehicle's weight is on the tires.",How to Flush Power Steering Fluid2," Since you will be rotating the steering wheel, jack stands are recommended in order to allow free movement of the tires.

, Some cars will not have a catch tray. If confused, check your owner's manual. If there is any fluid in this tray it likely means you have a leak and should bring the car into a mechanic.Place a disposable pan right under the location of the catch tray to capture the fluid as you flush it.
If you are extra car savvy, make sure you disconnect the line that goes from the power steering rack to the reservoir. While not strictly necessary, this will remove more fluid and lead to a better flush., There will be multiple thin (1/2-1"" thick) hoses running from your power steering. With your pan ready underneath, unhook this hose and drain the old fluid.


Be ready for the fluid to flow as soon as you unhook it. Gloves, eye protection, and long sleeves are recommended.

, In order to fully flush the system, you'll need to remove the air bubbles and push out the rest of the fluid in the hoses. Fill it roughly halfway before moving on., It is often easiest to have a friend turn the car on while you pour. You want to keep your eyes on the draining fluid as well as the current level of the reservoir. When the draining fluid is clearly new fluid, shut the car off.


Have your friend turn the wheel back and forth as you pour. This will help remove air from the lines.
The fluid will likely bubble as you fill it. This is good, as it represents the air being flushed from the system.

, Power steering fluid is not thick, so it should not be hard to close the line up once you're done working. Once the fluid is flushed, shut the car off and reattach everything how you found it.

, Once you've got the air out and the line closed, fill up the reservoir to the recommended level.

, Listen for a buzzing sound which indicates that there is air trapped in the system. Continue to turn the steering wheel until the fluid is properly circulated throughout the system, releasing any remaining air., More likely than not, your fluid level will seem to drop after you test the steering wheel. This is because fluid is being drawn out of the reservoir and into the lines. Top off the reservoir with more power steering fluid to finish the job., Turn the car on and turn the steering wheel back and forth. Ensure that the wheels can turn like normal. If they don't, bleed the system again and refill it.

"
"
Recognize that flushing power steering is not necessarily essential.,
Locate the power steering fluid reservoir on your engine.,
Mark the current level and condition of the power steering fluid.,
Use a turkey baster to suction the old fluid out of the reservoir.,
Refill the reservoir to its prior level with fresh fluid.,
Repeat the process a few weeks later to fully refresh the fluid.",How to Flush Power Steering Fluid3," Many owner's manuals never even mention steering fluid, and despite the urging of some mechanics, there is growing disagreement that a full flush is really needed for most cars.If the fluid doesn't smell burnt and there are no metallic bits in the fluid, you can get by with a simpler ""flush.""


If your fluid is dark or you are losing sleep worrying about your car, this simple procedure will refresh your fluid for the foreseeable future., This is usually labeled with a steering wheel icon on the cap.

, Note the color and consistency of the fluid. If it smells burnt or has bits of metal in it, you'll need to do a full flush of the system. Note the current level of the fluid.

, This will take some time, and you will not get everything, but this is a simple and easy way to get old fluid out without a complicated flush., This simple procedure will protect your car, cheaply, and is just as effective a method as a full flush if you have no other problems. The power steering system is, relatively speaking, rather clean and simple. Unlike other fluids, like oil, the power steering system doesn't even need a filter. This quick ""refresher"" is likely all you'll need to do to keep your wheels turning easily.


Many cars don't even recommend changing this fluid — you'll be ahead of the game if you even do this.

, Drive the car around, recirculating the fluid, and repeat a few weeks later if you want a full ""flush."" This won't get everything out, but more than enough to keep your car running happily."

Know that not all fuel tanks can be drained directly.,
Place a pan or receptacle underneath the drainage plug.,
Get under the car and find the drainage plug.,
Unscrew the drain plug and let the fuel drain.,
Replace the drain plug tightly and refill your car.",How to Drain the Gas Tank of Your Car2," This is a model by model fix, but it should work for most cars. If you can find your fuel tank while underneath the car, and you can detach the lines and/or small drain plug directly, this is the easiest way to drain the car.


Some vehicles have a fuel test port under the hood to which a fuel tester can be attached and drain the fuel with the special tool. This will require turning on the fuel pump while the engine is not running by jumping the fuel pump relay or using a scan tool.

, If you have several gallons of gas left in the tank, you need to be prepared to catch it. This is easier said than done, so try and gauge how much gas is in the tank before beginning and have the appropriate number of containers on hand before starting.


It is very, very hard to plug the tank back up while it is draining, so don't plan on stopping until the job is done.

, The fuel tank is a large, solid metal container on the same side of your car as you fill up gas on. Use your gas door as a gauge -- it is usually underneath the passenger-side seat. Make sure your pan is directly under the plug.


This plug is simply a small bolt screwed directly into the tank. Opening it simply creates a hole for gas to drain out. You usually need a spanner or socket wrench to remove it. However, not all vehicles will have this drain plug.
If you see the fuel lines, which are small, removable hoses underneath the tank, you can use these as well. However, you must turn the car on and off, repeatedly, to force the gas out of the tank, as it uses the electric fuel pump to to all the work., This will take a long time, up to several minutes per gallon, so you should keep an eye on it.Make sure to have more than enough drain pans to catch all the drained fuel and to make sure no fuel is spilled onto the ground.

, Take care to get the plug hooked up again properly, especially if you disconnected the fuel lines. Once everything is hooked back up, you're good to go.

"
Never drive with the wrong fuel type in the engine.,
Drain and replace the fuel on any car that's been sitting for more than six months to a year.,
Drain the gas if you need to replace the fuel pump.",How to Drain the Gas Tank of Your Car3," The most common mistake is to fill a car with diesel when it needs to run unleaded or filling a diesel vehicle with gasoline. The improper fuel can do serious damage to your engine, and can even total the car if you're not careful. Make sure you not only drain the fuel tank of the wrong fuel, but to flush out the fuel lines and replace the fuel filters.

, Fuel can, and will, go bad when it is just sitting in a tank. If you're thinking of dusting off the old car in the garage for a spin, make sure you drain and replace the gas to ensure that everything runs smoothly. This is equally important if you're trying to fix a car up or work on it's engine.


The introduction of ethanol into the gas supply has greatly reduced the life-span of gasoline. It degrades much faster, meaning you need to be extra vigilant about draining the fuel if the car hasn't run in a long time., You can't proceed with the repair if there is still gas in the tank, so be sure to take you time draining it before beginning.You must also drain the gas to replace the fuel gauge sending unit.

Use high octane on forced induction applications.,
Switch octane ratings with older models, if necessary.,
Run higher octane fuel in hot temperatures.,
Use a higher octane when towing something with your vehicle.",How to Choose the Right Fuel for Your Car2," If your vehicle has been modified to add a turbocharger or supercharger to increase power output, it has the same effect as dramatically increasing the compression ratio of the cylinders in your engine. These engines require a higher octane fuel due to the increased likelihood of pre-detonation. If you aren’t certain if your vehicle came with a form of forced induction from the factory, check the auto manufacturer’s website.If your vehicle came turbocharged or supercharged from the factory, it likely requires premium fuel, which is considered to be 91 octane or higher.
If you added a form of forced induction to the engine, it also will require high octane fuel. Some aftermarket forced induction applications even require higher octane than is offered at most gas stations.

, While most vehicles are designed to run on 87 octane, carbon build up in the engine over years of use may result in an increased likelihood of pre-detonation. As the engine burns fuel, carbon begins to develop inside the cylinder. Over time, this can create hot spots that may ignite the air and fuel mixture early. Switching to a higher octane fuel at around the hundred thousand mile mark may help you to avoid this.If your car was designed for 87 octane, you may want to switch to 89 at around the hundred thousand mile mark.
Not all cars will suffer pre-detonation as a result of carbon build up, but switching to a higher octane can reduce the risk if yours does.

, Because the octane level of your fuel helps to determine its stability under high heat and high pressure, an increase in the ambient temperature of the air can have an effect on the way your vehicle runs. Hotter air entering the cylinder has an increased likelihood of pre-detonation as it is mixed with fuel and compressed. Locations that suffer extreme highs like the desert, or any area that routinely exceeds one hundred degrees Fahrenheit may require a higher octane fuel, particularly in older vehicles with carbon buildup.Exceptionally low humidity can increase the risk of pre-detonation further, so deserts may require a higher octane fuel.
If you will be driving through extremely high temperatures and low levels of humidity, you may want to add a higher octane fuel to your vehicle.

, Research has shown that under rigorous driving, a higher octane fuel may help reduce the stress on your engine. Towing something behind your vehicle or carrying heavy loads forces the engine to work much harder. This type of driving is referred to as “severe duty operation.” Severe duty operation can be made even worse when driving in high temperature, low humidity areas like the desert.During severe duty operation, running a higher octane fuel can improve gas mileage and emissions.
These benefits are dramatically reduced during normal vehicle operation.

"
"
Take your budget into account.,
Take the altitude into account.,
Add octane boosters to increase fuel stability.,
Look for top tier gas.",How to Choose the Right Fuel for Your Car3," Some vehicle’s owner’s manuals will suggest that you can use a range of octane levels when choosing fuel. Automakers suggest that in vehicles designed for multiple octane ratings, using the lower octane option may compromise the performance of your engine slightly. However, research has shown that the difference in the performance of these engines while using the lower octane options has been negligible at best. For most driving applications, using the less expensive, lower octane fuel will come with no adverse effects.If your owner’s manual allows for a range of octane levels, choose the one that best fits your budget.
Remember that the drop in the performance of your engine at a lower octane is negligible under most driving conditions.

, You may have heard the expression, “the air is thinner” at high altitude. The “thinning” of the air is caused by a reduced amount of oxygen in the ambient air around you. The higher you are, the less oxygen can reach you and your engine. Effectively, driving at a high altitude affects your engine in the same way reducing the compression ratio would. With less oxygen entering each cylinder, the likelihood of pre-detonation is reduced. At many locations that are 5,000 feet above sea level or higher, 85 octane fuel is sold for this very reason.If you live in a high elevation area (4,000 feet above sea level or higher) you can safely run a lower octane fuel than you might closer to sea level.
Remember that running a lower octane fuel can become risky if you drive your vehicle to a lower elevation.

, If you find yourself in a situation where your engine could benefit from an increase in the octane of the fuel its running, either because of extreme weather or severe duty driving, you can add ethanol to the fuel to increase its stability. Ethanol is a form of alcohol with an average octane rating of about 109, and mixing it with fuel can increase the octane rating of an entire tank.Most gasoline purchased in the United States is already about ten percent ethanol.
You can purchase ethanol octane boosters at most auto parts stores and many large retailers.
Always add ethanol to a full tank of gas.

, Regardless of the octane level you choose, running top tier gas in your vehicle will increase the engine’s longevity, as well as possibly improving your gas mileage and performance. To be considered a top tier fuel distributor, your gas must contain at least three times the required detergent levels set by the EPA. Premium fuel often contains higher levels of these detergents, so you may opt to purchase premium fuel strictly because it will reduce the likelihood of your fuel system clogging. You can find top tier gas at a number of gas stations, including:BP (British Petroleum)
Texaco
Costco
Exxon

Long sleeves and protective gloves can also help avoid skin exposure., An absorbent material, such as kitty litter, sand, or baking soda, can pick up antifreeze. Treat the spill immediately by layering material over it., Paper towels will aid in absorption and protect the material from scattering. Extra layers can be added to ensure no antifreeze escapes., At the very least, wait one hour as the antifreeze is absorbed. Don’t wait too long, though. Come back within three hours to make sure the antifreeze hasn’t set in as a stain., Pick up the absorbent material and leftover antifreeze with some dry paper towels. Wash your hands with soap and water when finished so you don’t accidently ingest any fluid., The antifreeze-soaked litter and paper towels can go through regular garbage disposal. Seal the bag and keep it away from children and animals. Antifreeze is dangerous to consume, so anyone who touches the material should wash their hands immediately., An average laundry or dish detergent will also help clean your floor. For stains that have begun to set in, try powdered detergent. Pour some soap out over the stain. Let the soap settle for a minute., Spray some water onto the spill to moisten it. Use a nylon brush to scrub in the soap. Finish by flushing the area with water., Keep the spot exposed to air so it can dry. Open any nearby doors or windows.

Make sure the engine isn't hot.,
Open the hood.,
Pull out the dipstick and wipe it off with a clean rag.,
Reinsert the dipstick.,
Remove the dipstick a second time to gauge the oil level.,
Determine whether the oil needs to be changed.",How to Check Your Oil1," You can burn yourself if you handle engine parts right after you turn off your car. Wait at least 10 minutes or plan to check your oil while the engine is cold.


A cool engine ensures that the oil enough time to settle at the bottom of the oil pan and will give you a more accurate reading of how much oil is in the car.;
, Most cars have an interior hood-popping lever located under the steering column. Pull the lever, then walk to the front of your car and unlatch the hood. Raise the hood so that it is completely open, and prop it up with a metal prop if your car has one.


In a small number of cars (such as the Mini Cooper) the hood release on the passenger side.
Make sure the vehicle is on a flat and level surface or the dipstick will provide an inaccurate reading. This is done best at a gas station where the surface is flat and even.

, The dipstick is connected to the oil tank in your engine, and is used to determine how much oil is still in the oil tank. When the car is in motion the oil splashes around and covers the entire stick. To check your oil level you need to start with a clean stick.


The dipstick is often located near the front of the engine. When you locate it, give it a tug; it should pull out smoothly.
Take care not to pull out the transmission fluid dipstick. If you're not sure which dipstick is connected to the oil tank, check the user manual that came with your car, or ask a gas station attendant for help.

, Carefully place the dipstick back into the pipe connected to the oil tank. Push it all the way down until it is completely reinserted. If it gets rattled or caught along the way, pull it back out, wipe it off, and try again.

, Look at the end of the dipstick to see where the oil's film ends. The end of the stick will have the word ""ADD"" toward the end, and ""FULL"" toward the middle.


If the oil film reaches up to or below the ADD line, it's time to add more oil.
If the oil film is close to the FULL line, you don't have to add more oil quite yet.

, In addition to checking the quantity of the oil, you should also check the quality. The oil should look clean and smooth. If the oil looks like it contains debris or looks cloudy, it needs to be changed.

Find out what kind of oil to use.,
Unscrew the oil cap.,
Pour in the oil.,
Check the oil again.,
Replace the cap and close the hood.",How to Check Your Oil2," Oil comes in different ""weights,"" and different cars require different weights. Check your car's user manual to figure out what kind of oil you need to use, then buy a quart of it from a gas station or convenience store.

, You don't pour oil down the same pip where the dipstick is located; instead, unscrew the cap located a few inches away.

, If your oil was very low, pour in the entire quart. You can use a funnel if you wish, or just pour it directly from the bottle into the tank.

, Go ahead and pull out the dipstick, wipe it with a rag, reinsert it, and check the oil level to make sure the car now has enough oil. It should now come up to the FULL line.

, Screw the cap back on tightly, lower the hood and make sure it is firmly closed before starting your engine.

Know how often to change your oil.,
Change your own oil.,
Hire someone to change your oil.",How to Check Your Oil3," How often you need to change your oil depends on the type of car you own. Some cars need an oil change every 3,000 miles (4,800 km), while others can go up to 10,000 or even 15,000 miles (24,000 km) without an oil change. Research your car and talk to the manufacturer or your mechanic to determine how often your oil should be changed.

, Changing your car's oil can save you between $25 and $75 dollars. If you don't have an aptitude for working on cars, there's no reason why you can't do it yourself. Make sure you have the right oil and tools before you begin.

, Most people take their car to a garage to have the oil changed. Simply drive up to an ""oil and lube"" facility and let the mechanic there know that your oil needs to be changed. The service usually takes about half an hour and is done by a mechanic while you wait in the lobby.

It also has to be completely level in order to get an accurate idea of how much fluid is inside it. Find an even surface that is strong enough to support the weight of the vehicle beneath a jack and jack stands.Concrete or black top are the best surfaces to use..
Never jack up a vehicle on grass, dirt or gravel as the jack may topple over.;
, Slide a scissor or trolley jack beneath one of the designated jack points on the rear of the vehicle. Lift the vehicle up high enough for you to access the rear differential comfortably and safely.If you are unsure where to locate your car’s designated jack points, refer to the owner’s manual for guidance.
The height required to comfortably access the differential will vary from vehicle to vehicle.

, Once you have jacked up one side of the car high enough to work beneath it, you’ll need to place a jack stand beneath it so you can lift the opposite side. Slide the jack stand under one of the vehicle’s jack points and raise it to the appropriate height to come into contact with the bottom of the car.Lower the car slowly onto the jack stand, to ensure it is placed properly and will support the weight of the vehicle.

, With the jack stand in place on one side, find the designated jack point on the other side of the car and raise it as well. At this point, the rear of the vehicle should be in the air. Place another jack stand beneath this side of the vehicle to support it as you did on the other side.While you can sometimes raise the entire rear end of the vehicle from jacking it up from a mid-point, there is a higher likelihood of the vehicle tipping off of the jack and getting damaged when doing so.
Be sure the jack stands are holding the vehicle and that it is stable.

, The entire car will need to be off the ground and level in order to accurately check the level of gear oil in the differential, so all four wheels will have to be off the ground. Jack up the front of the vehicle and place jack stands beneath it to support its weight.Be sure all of the jack stands are set to the same height so the vehicle is as close to level as possible.
If you have access to a lift, it is a much faster and easier way to raise the vehicle at an even height.

, Only vehicles that are powered by their rear wheels or all four wheels will have a rear differential. You can locate it by following the drive shaft that travels the length of the car, from the transmission to the rear differential, or by looking for the pumpkin shaped metal object mounted between the rear wheels.The rear differential is easy to identify, as it connects the transmission to the wheels.
Because of its vaguely pumpkin-like shape, rear differentials are often referred to as a car’s “rear pumpkin.”

, Once you find the differential, visually inspect it for signs of damage and to locate the drain and filler plugs. The drain plug is located on or near the bottom of the differential while the filler/service plug will be on the side and closer to the top.If the rear differential has been damaged, it will require service from a professional.
The fill/service plug is usually not a traditional looking bolt, but rather has an opening for a 3/8 inch drive ratchet.

, When you open the fill/service port to check the fluid levels, dirt and debris surrounding the port could fall into it, potentially causing damage to the gears inside. To prevent this, clean the area surrounding the service port with brake cleaner and a steel bristled brush.The brake cleaner will evaporate quickly, leaving a dry surface.
Use the brush to remove large deposits of stuck on dirt.

, Insert a 3/8 inch drive ratchet (without a socket) into the hole in the service port and turn it counter clockwise (left) to loosen it. It may require a fair amount of force to loosen, as some of the road grime may have caked into the gap between the plug and the differential.In some applications, the plug may be a bolt. In these cases, find the appropriate sized socket to remove the bolt.
Be extremely careful not to strip the bolt. Be sure to use the correct size socket.

, The gear oil in the rear differential should reach the bottom of the service port hole. Insert one finger into the open service port. Bend your finger downward slightly to see if it comes into contact with gear oil.If your finger touches gear oil, there is enough fluid inside.
If the fluid level doesn’t reach the service port, it is low.

, It is absolutely imperative that you refill the gear oil in your car’s rear differential with the correct type of fluid. Refer to the owner’s or service manual for your car in order to find the correct type of gear oil to purchase.You can also ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to assist you in finding the right gear oil.
Purchase gear oil that comes in a squeezable plastic bottle with a spout unless you have an oil pump to use.

, Open the container of rear differential gear oil and insert the end of the long spout into the open filler/service port. Squeeze the bottle slowly to push the oil out of the bottle and into the differential until fluid begins to leak out of the hole.Make sure to wipe up any fluid that leaks out of the open service port.
If the differential takes an entire bottle of gear oil, you may want to have the differential looked at by a mechanic to address any possible leaks.

, Once the differential is full, reinsert the plug for the filler/service port and turn it clockwise (to the right) until it is tight. Use the appropriate wrench to tighten it enough to ensure it won’t vibrate loose as you drive.Do not overtighten the plug, it needs only to be tight enough to be secure.
Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle back to the ground.

,, On most cars, the washer fluid reservoir is located at the back of the engine bay, near the base of the windshield. The tank is usually translucent, allowing you to see whether there is fluid in the reservoir or not.

, Many washer fluid reservoirs have marks to show the fluid level. If the tank is less than half-full, you'll need to refill it.


Also, check the tank for cracks or leaks.

, The reservoir cap usually is designed to screw on and off.








, You may want to use a funnel to avoid spills. Once you've refilled the tank, replace the cap and close the hood.








, This will let you test the washers' performance by turning on your windshield wipers and then the washers. The washers should deliver a steady stream of fluid; if not, you may have to clean the washer nozzles and lines.

Add the appropriate oil in small increments.,
Check the oil again.",How to Check Oil Level in Car," Mobil One and other oil manufacturers recommend checking engine oil levels before driving your vehicle, when the oil is still cold. However, some manufacturers will recommend checking the oil after you've warmed up the engine, so check your owner's manual to find the specific recommendations for your vehicle.You want the oil to be in the oil pan, not in the engine as it will be while you're driving. Immediately after driving, the oil level will appear lower, making it easier to overfill the oil. If you want to check the oil and have been driving the vehicle, wait five or ten minutes to let it settle into the oil pan before checking it.









In very cold weather, it may be appropriate to drive the car around a bit first to get the oil loosened up and less viscous before checking it. Let the engine run for a few minutes, then let it cool down for five before you check it.
Many people disagree about whether or not the oil should be checked hot or cold. Some manufacturers recommend checking engine oil warm, and it's perfectly fine to do so as long as you're looking at the right line. There will appear to be ""less"" oil on the gauge when the oil is colder, but the oil will thin out as the vehicle runs up to normal operating temperature.
Synthetic oil expands more when it is hot than ""regular"" oil does, so it may be best to check your oil cold if you use synthetic oil. Talk to your mechanic if you aren't sure.;
, To get an accurate reading, you'll also need to make sure the oil isn't sloshed to one side of the pan, which can give you a slightly inaccurate reading. Try to find a relatively flat surface on which to park and check your oil.








, Usually, there will be a latch somewhere at the foot of the driver side door that looks like the front of your car opening up. You'll pull or push this latch, depending on the make and model of the vehicle. Then, you'll need to exit the car and look under the front of the hood for a latch, usually at the center but sometimes slightly off-center. Pull this and raise the hood to examine the engine.








On some cars, the hood will stay up, while on others it will require a prop rod, which is usually folded up on the front or side of the engine compartment. Lift this support into place (there will be an opening on the hood to insert it) and let go of the hood.

, On most cars, the oil dipstick will have a red, orange, or yellow cap. It's a circular or rectangular shape, and should be pointing out directly from the engine block, to one side or the other. Some vehicles, such as Hondas and some Fords, may have the dipstick point out directly from the top of the valve cover. Oil dipsticks are typically located towards the passenger side or near the front and are usually inserted into a dipstick guide about the size of a pencil.









On most cars, there should also be a symbol that looks like an old-style oil can to demarcate the proper dipstick. When you've located the dipstick, you're ready to remove it and check the oil.
Most automatic transmission vehicles will have two dipsticks under the hood, one for the oil and one for the transmission fluid. Transmission dipsticks are typically found at the rear of the engine bay or towards the driver's side, and the dipstick will commonly be inserted into a slightly larger tube. This transmission fluid is typically pink or red. Never confuse the two. Never put oil into the transmission, which can cost you serious money.

, When you check your oil, it's important that you have a couple of paper towels or some other cloth that you can use to wipe it off and check the consistency of the oil. Paper towels usually work best, because it gives you a nice white backdrop contrast to examine the color. Also a great way to keep your hands clean.








, Most dipsticks range from a foot to three feet, and you'll need to check the very tip to get the reading you're looking for. Slowly pull the dipstick out, holding a paper towel around the port as you pull, to wipe the oil off and keep it from flipping up and out.









You shouldn't have to pull very hard or twist on most oil dipsticks, but you might have to use a little bit of strength to get it to come free. Once you've got the cap off, it should pull free quite easily. Don't force it.

, The color and the consistency of engine oil is indicative of its age, and possibly of other engine efficiency issues that you might need to address. As soon as you remove the dipstick, you can get a good sense of the quality of the oil in your engine. Engine oil that's in good condition should look slightly yellow-greenish on the rag, and shouldn't be super-dark. Wipe the oil off the end of the dipstick and examine it on the rag.









Oil will change in color from golden or amber colored to brown and black as more and more particulate gets in the oil from the engine. Metal filings and particulate will slowly scrape the cylinders of your engine over time, which is why the oil needs to be changed according to the manufacturer's recommended service interval (check your owner's manual or service booklet to find your vehicle's service interval).
Look at the color, specifically. Does it look brackish, or chunky? Does it look black or dark? If so, it's likely a sign that your oil needs changed. Take the car in to have it serviced, or change the oil yourself.

, The first time you pull the dipstick out, you can't learn much about the amount of oil, since the dipstick will have oil stuck on it at many different points. Once you pull out the dipstick and examine the color, wipe off the end and reinsert it into the hole, then pull it back out immediately to get a good reading on the amount.







, There should be two small dots on the end of most dipsticks, and one corresponds to the maximum fill line in the oil pan and the other refers to the minimum. The minimum dot should be close to the tip, and the maximum should be about an inch or so up from that on the dipstick. In a properly filled car that's cool, the line should be just about halfway between the two points.









In general, the ""minimum"" marker should be close to the very dip of the dipstick. If the line of oil on the dipstick is between the tip and that mark, you need to add oil to the car.
The oil should never be higher than the maximum fill point, though it will be close to that point when the oil is hot. If it is, you may need to drain some oil from your car.

, Before you try to add oil, you need to find out what kind of oil your car requires. It's important to always check, because the types vary, even from one model and season to another. It's generally unwise to mix different grades of oil, so check carefully with the manual or your local mechanic before you add oil to the car.


Alternatively, you can also talk with the staff at most auto supply stores to figure out what kind of oil you need to put in your car. As long as you know the make and the model, they should be able to look it up and tell you, or you can look it up yourself in the manual in the oil section.

, These caps are typically well marked with the words ""Oil Fill"" and sometimes with the grade of engine oil your vehicle uses. If you see 5w30, for example, written on the cap, you'll know what kind of oil you need to add. Remove the cap, wipe it off with a paper towel or the rag you've been using, and insert a clean funnel.


You need to use a funnel to add engine oil, or you'll risk spilling it all over the engine block, which will burn off and create a terrible smell, and possibly worse problems.

, It's important to allow time for the additional oil to drain down into the oil pan. It should fill it up the funnel suddenly and then glug down slowly. Avoid overfilling the funnel.


If you spill a little bit of oil on the engine compartment, don't panic. Spilled oil tends not to be super-dangerous, though it will smell bad and may smoke some. Try to wipe it up as best you can with a rag or a towel.

, Remove the dipstick and check the level. Repeat this process until the appropriate amount of oil is showing on the dipstick. Wipe the stick off after each read. Once you have finished, double check that the dipstick is fully seated and the oil fill cap has been tightened. Double check any other locations you have checked, remove any rags, paper towels or oil bottles. Lower the hood prop and close the hood.

Making sure everything is cleared out also prevents your date from finding anything of yours that is embarrassing. Clean out any of your stuff you want to keep, this includes bags, books, and papers. Once the car is empty of your stuff, clean out any trash, wrappers, and food that you can see and throw it away. Clean out any small objects, such as pencils, paper clips, and pens.


Look in every compartment, under the seats, and in the trunk to make sure you have retrieved everything.;
, Remove the floor mats and vacuum the seats and the floor. Make sure to vacuum under the seats and under the pedals too. Use a soft brush attachment and vacuum the center console, the doors, and the dashboard. If you have leather seats use a soft brush attachment for those too. , If you have any obvious stains on your fabric seats or carpet, make sure to remove them before your date. Spray the stain with fabric stain remover or detergent mixed with water and rub quickly with a cloth. , If your car has leather seats instead of fabric, wipe them down before your date. Using a slightly moist cotton towel to clean the leather should be sufficient enough to give your date a good impression. You can use leather cleaner and a cotton towel if your seats are particularly dirty. The last thing you want is your date sitting on a sticky seat. , Put your car somewhere where the ground can get dirty and wet. Make sure a hose can reach your car. Get a hose and rinse your car off to remove any debris. Fill two buckets with water and put soap in one bucket. , Dip a sponge in the soapy water and start washing the car at the top, working your way down. The bottom of the car is the dirtiest and you don’t want to transfer the dirt at the bottom of the car to the top. Make sure to thoroughly clean the tires and wheels too.


Use the bucket of water to rinse your sponge before you put it back in the soapy water. Replenish the sponge often.

, Use a hose to rinse off any leftover soap and to prevent soap residue staining your car.

Going to a car wash is probably your best choice if you live somewhere cold and don’t want to spend time outside washing your car, if you have a few extra dollars to spend to get it washed, or if you are low on time before the date.

, If your car smells really badly, spray the inside with car freshener. You can also use Febreeze instead to help fix the bad smell. Hang a car air freshener on the mirror to maintain the good smell. Don’t spray anything strong in the car like perfumes or colognes. These can be too strong and could even give your date a headache.

, You want to make sure your date is going to have enough leg room. Push the passenger seat back before the date starts so you don’t have to try to maneuver the seat for them during the date.

, Before the date stick a blanket, sweatshirt, umbrella, and anything else you might need in the trunk of your car. You never know where you might end up and it is good to be prepared. If you decide to go last minute star gazing, you will be glad you brought the blanket. Your date will be very impressed if it starts raining and you have an umbrella on hand or an extra sweatshirt for them if they get cold.

, It would be very awkward if you pick your date up then realize you need to get gas. Make sure to get plenty of gas before the date so you don’t have to do it during the date.

, Don’t let all your hard work go to waste. Offer to pick your date up. Arrive on time. Don’t honk when you get to their house, instead walk up to the front door and ring the doorbell or knock. If it seems appropriate, open the passenger door for them to help them into your car. "

, Rinse the entire surface of the car thoroughly before applying soap. Make sure to remove loose dirt and debris to avoid scratching your car. Remove leaves, twigs, and other debris with your hands.








Set the hose on a high-pressure setting to rinse hard-to-remove dirt, debris, and grime. However, make sure the pressure isn't too high so as not to remove your car's wax or paint.

, And work on one section at a time. Make sure to completely rinse each section with water after you finish cleaning it with soap. This will prevent the soap from drying onto your car.







, Then scrub your car in a straight up and down motion. Do not clean the car in a circular motion. Scrubbing in a circular motion can cause swirl marks.







, Rinse it in the second bucket that contains water after each use. If your sponge falls onto the ground, make sure to rinse it in the water. If not, the debris on the sponge may scratch your car.







, This can cause watermarks and streaking. Instead, use a soft-terry towel or a chamois (synthetic or natural) to dry it. Try blotting the water instead of wiping it to dry your car.







, Mix a cleaner into one of the buckets. Make sure to use a cleaner that is safe for all wheel surfaces. Avoid caustic cleaners that contain acid, as well as dishwashing detergents. These cleaners can ruin the finish on your wheels.








One bucket will be used for cleaning and the other will be used for rinsing your sponge.

, Once the sponge has soaked for a few minutes, begin cleaning one wheel at a time from the top down. To clean small crevices, use a soft-bristled toothbrush.








If your wheels are very dirty, you may need to apply a de-greaser before cleaning them.

, Once your wheel is clean, rinse it thoroughly with water until all dirt and debris are removed. Then dry the wheel with a soft cloth.








Repeat steps one through three for each wheel.

, Flatten one of the pieces so that three of your fingers can hold it in place. Spray a fair amount of clay lube onto a small section of the car (24"" by 24""). Then, gently glide the clay over the lubricated section in a back and forth motion (not a circular motion).








Once the clay begins to glide smoothly over the section and you do not hear or feel a roughness in the finish, move onto the next section.
Make sure to use the clean parts of the clay on the new sections as you work.
Clay bars are used to remove microscopic dirt from your car's body to prevent scratching during the waxing process.

, Apply the wax in a straight up and down motion onto the body of your car. Do not apply it in a circular motion, and do not wax your windows or the trim. Use gentle pressure when applying the wax to get a smooth, even coat.








Make sure to apply thin layers of wax as opposed to thick layers. As a rule of thumb, it is better to apply multiple thin layers than to apply one thick layer.

, Move the towel in a straight up and down motion as opposed to a circular motion. Use a high quality towel to prevent scratching.








Before buffing the wax, you may need to let the wax dry. It depends on which formula you are using. To be safe, follow the product’s instructions.

, Shake them out to remove dust, dirt, and debris. Place them on the ground for vacuuming at a later time. However, you can vacuum them right away if you want. It is your preference.







, Pick up large pieces of trash like paper, coins, pens, and other objects from your floorboard using your hands. Place these items in a trash bag. Wear latex gloves to protect your hands from getting dirty.








Use a BBQ skewer to remove dirt and pieces of trash from small crevices like in between seats.
Make sure to remove trash from cup holders as well.

, Let the glass cleaner set for 5 to 10 minutes. Then use a paper towel to clean out the dirt and grime. Use the BBQ skewer to pick out grime and dirt from any small crevices.








Alternatively, place an old sock on the bottom of a mug or travel cup. Then place the mug in the cup holder and twist to remove dirt and grime.

, Start at the top of the seats, dashboard, and console before moving to the floor. Use the upholstery nozzle to vacuum the seats, upholstered areas, and the headliner. Use the brush attachment to vacuum the components that contain hard vinyl, plastic, and metal such as the dashboard and console. To clean small crevices and tight areas, use the crevice attachment.








Adjust the seats backwards and forwards to clean hard to reach spots under the seats.

, Spray the cleaner onto the stain and use a stiff bristle brush to rub it into the carpet. Be careful not to spray too much cleaner onto the carpet as this can cause mildew if it is not dried thoroughly.








Use a clean, dry towel to blot the stains and dry the area.

, Rub the cleanser into the stain with a soft brush. Let the cleanser dry. Then use a vacuum to remove it per the instructions. If the stain remains, then spray more cleanser onto the affected area and clean again until it is gone.








If your seats are leather, then make sure to use a leather cleanser or saddle soap to clean your seats, as well as other components of the car that contain leather.

, Make sure to use specially formulated car wipes. You can find these at your local auto shop. Use Q-tips or cotton swabs to clean small areas like radio buttons, air vents, and panel seams.








If you do not have car wipes, then an all-purpose household cleaner that is ammonia-free will do.

, Any household glass cleaner will do. Instead of spraying the cleaner directly onto the window, spray it onto a clean, microfiber towel. Then wipe both the inside and outside of your windows in a straight up and down motion.








Roll down your windows to thoroughly clean the top section of the window.

, This will remove any dirt and grime that was knocked out during the cleaning process. Then shake and vacuum the floor mats thoroughly if you have not already done so. Place them inside your car.








Use an odor-removal spray, like Febreeze, to remove any remaining smells from your car.

Wash and dry your vehicle.,
Rub on a coating of wax.,
Wipe away the wax.,
Wax your car every 2-3 months.",How to Clean Insects Off a Car's Exterior2," Before you apply a wax or polish to your car, it’s important that it be completely clean. It’s also recommended that you work somewhere that’s not in direct sunlight, as this can make it harder for the wax to set properly.Speed the drying process along by going over the exterior with an absorbent chamois.Waxing a dirty car will just trap dirt and debris against the paint.

, Dab a small amount of wax onto a clean buffer pad and spread it over the area you’re waxing. Then, leave the wax to sit for a few minutes. As it dries, it will begin to grow cloudy, which is how you’ll know it’s time to wipe it off.Car waxes typically come in one of two forms: a liquid or a thick paste. Both types of wax can be applied using the same techniques.Wax should only be used on the painted areas of your vehicle’s exterior, not the windshield, wheels or other parts.

, Use a non-abrasive cloth, like a microfiber or terry cloth towel, to buff out the dried wax. Doing so will leave your car with a clear, polished shine. A coat of wax will also act as a defensive barrier that makes crushed bugs easier to wipe away in the future.Buff with short, circular strokes to avoid leaving streaks.For maximum efficiency, concentrate on a single section at a time until you’ve gone over your entire vehicle.

, The wax will begin to wear down and lose its effectiveness within a month. You can maintain your car’s armor by regularly applying a fresh coat of wax. Not only will this keep it looking good, it will also make it less likely to attract bugs and other roadway messes.If you dread the time and labor involved in waxing your vehicle yourself, consider taking it to have it done by a professional.

Treat stubborn spots with Ivory soap.,
Spot clean with baking soda.,
Use WD-40 to loosen insect grime.,
Scour heavy buildup with steel wool.",How to Clean Insects Off a Car's Exterior3," While most varieties of household soaps are a poor fit for automobiles, Ivory soap is designed to be especially gentle. It contains mild acids that will eat away at sun-baked splatters without harming the paint underneath.Ivory soap is available in liquid or bar form, and can be found at most major supermarkets or drug stores.
To treat your car’s finish with a solid bar of soap, rub the soap into damp cloth until it begins to bubble, then use the cloth to scrub the affected area.

, Mix a couple tablespoons of baking soda with water to form a paste. Spread the paste over small areas littered with dried insects and leave it to sit for 5-10 minutes. Once time is up, wipe away the baking soda paste with a microfiber towel, then rinse and dry.Baking soda is another item most people keep in their homes that can be used to safely and effectively lift stains on a vehicle’s exterior.

, Spray the spot very lightly with WD-40 and leave it to take effect for 1-2 minutes. You can then simply wipe away the insects using a clean cloth. This makes a handy solution for busting bug spots when you’re unable to give your car a proper wash or wax.Oils like WD-40 are formulated to cut through grease and other types of resilient residue, which makes it perfect for dealing with crusty gunk.
As an added bonus, WD-40 is useful for reducing the appearance of scratches in a car’s paint., If insects are piled on so thick that other methods fail to remove them, or they’ve had a long time to become cemented into place, you can use a very fine steel wool (#000 grade is optimal) to wear them down. This will require you to work slowly and cautiously, but with a steady hand it’s practically guaranteed to erase even the most maddening messes.Focus on a small area and use as little pressure as possible.
This is only recommended as a worst case scenario solution. If you’re not careful, you could easily leave scratches on your car.

Cut out your sandpaper.,
Dip the sandpaper in water.,
Wet the tail light.,
Sand the tail light gently.,
Apply a plastic polish to the tail light.,
Buff the tail light.,
Wipe down the tail light.",How to Clean Tail Lights1," You should cut down a piece of sandpaper so that it fits comfortably in your hand. You’ll be sanding your tail light by hand, so cut a piece that's big enough to cover a lot of area but small enough for you to easily handle. Look for sandpaper with a 2000 grit., Once you have the size sandpaper you need, dip it in clean, clear water. The sandpaper won’t hold a lot of water, so you might need to dip it more than once as you work on your tail light.

, Before you start sanding with the wet sandpaper, you’ll also want to get some water on the tail light, too. This prevents your tail light from getting over scratched even if the sandpaper loses some of its water., Run your sandpaper gently over the surface of the tail light for about a minute. You shouldn’t apply too much pressure to the sandpaper, since this can also deeply scratch the tail light. Run the sandpaper across the surface and let the grit of the sandpaper do the work., After you’ve sanded your tail lights, you’ll need to apply a plastic polish. Apply two dollops to your tail light. It will spread out when you begin to buff the tail light.Any plastic polish will do, but some are made specifically for auto plastic. Brands like Turtle Wax are a good choice for this.

, Once you’ve applied the plastic polish, use a buffer pad to polish the tail light and buff out scratches. This will take care of scratches both caused by the sandpaper and deeper scratches that the sandpaper couldn’t get out., Once you’re done buffing the tail light, wipe down the tail light with a clean cloth. This will remove any excess polish and give your tail lights a nice shine.

"
"
Rinse off the tail lights.,
Spread toothpaste over the tail light.,
Rub the toothpaste in.,
Wipe off the tail lights with a clean rag.",How to Clean Tail Lights2," Before you apply toothpaste to your tail lights, rinse any dirt or debris off of them. If you apply toothpaste without rinsing off your tail lights, dirt can get stuck in the toothpaste and it will prevent your tail light from coming clean.

, You should use about three times the amount you’d use to brush your teeth for each tail light. It doesn’t have to be spread evenly since this will happen as you rub the toothpaste in.If you’re using a towel, rather than a buffer, to rub the toothpaste in, apply toothpaste to a small area of your tail light at a time. If you put too much on the tail light and can’t rub it in right away, you’ll end up with dried-on toothpaste.

, Using either a towel or a buffer pad, rub the toothpaste in to the tail light. If you’re using a towel, this will take a little bit longer. You should rub the toothpaste in until it basically disappears., Once you’ve rubbed the toothpaste in, wipe down the tail lights with a clean rag. This will show you if you’ve missed any spots and where you might need to go over things again."
"
Select a combination protectant, cleaner, and polisher.,
Spray on the cleaner.,
Let it sit for a few minutes.,
Wipe off the tail lights with a clean rag.",How to Clean Tail Lights3," If you don’t want to take the time to buff in a polisher or cleaner, you can select a combination product. Common brands of this type of cleaner include Armor All and Chemical Guys cleaners., The spray will be a bit thicker so it won’t run off as quickly, but it will still run off. Make sure you spray enough that even if some drips off, most of it will stay on the lights.

, After you’ve sprayed the lights with your selected cleaner, let it sit on the light for five to ten minutes. This will give the spray a chance to work into the dirt on your lights, as well as the scratches on your tail lights., Once you’ve let the spray cleaner sit on your tail lights, wipe it off with a clean rag. Your tail lights should come completely clean and also have a shine. If your tail lights are very dirty, you might have to repeat this procedure once or twice."

Purchase a fuel injector cleaner kit.,
Review your vehicle's engine layout.,
Disconnect the fuel pump from the fuel injectors.,
Disconnect the pressure regulator vacuum line.

,
Connect the cleaning kit to the fuel pressure test port.,
Remove the cap from the fuel tank.,
Turn the vehicle on and let the engine run.,
Remove the cleaner.

,
Reattach the fuel pump power supply and the pressure regulator vacuum hose.,
Put the fuel cap back into place.

,
Turn the vehicle on again to make sure the fuel injectors work.",How to Clean Fuel Injectors," These are available for purchase at any auto store, or you can buy one online. Cleaning kits come with a canister of fuel injector cleaner, a gauge you use to determine the fuel pressure, and a hose that attaches to the fuel injector and fuel rail.

Most fuel injector cleaning kits can be used for any type of vehicle, but read the manual to make sure the one you pick out is a good match for yours.
Sometimes the required cleaning fluid is sold separately from the canister and other tools that come with the cleaning kit.;
, Take a look at your vehicle's manual to determine where the fuel injectors are located. Identify the locations of the fuel pump and its components as well.

, Either connect the fuel return line, or insert a U tube so the gas returns to the tank while you're cleaning the injectors. Some vehicles require you to remove fuel pump fuse or relay.


Follow the instructions in your vehicle's manual if you aren't sure how to disconnect the fuel pump and connect the fuel return line or insert a U tube.

,, This is attached to the fuel rail in your engine.


Your fuel injector cleaner kit will have detailed instructions on how to attach the hose and fitting to the fuel port.
Make sure the injectors have no exposure to fuel, as the cleaner is flammable.

, The cleaner will clean debris and grime by using a burst of pressure to inject a cleaning solvent into the fuel injectors. Opening the fuel cap will prevent excessive pressure from building up, which could cause combustion.

, Before you do this, double check to make sure that the fuel pump is turned off.


It usually takes 5 to 10 minutes for the cleaner to cycle through the injectors and get used up. Follow the instructions that came with your cleaner kit.
The engine will shut down on its own after the cleaner has been fully used.

,,,, Listen for any abnormal noises. Drive the vehicle a short distance to make sure it runs smoothly.


If you followed the procedure correctly and notice abnormal noises, contact a professional auto mechanic.
If your vehicle is still getting bad gas mileage, hesitating when you press the gas pedal or runs rough, take it to a mechanic, as you may need to replace the fuel injectors or address a different problem.

Check your tire pressure weekly.,
Visually examine tires for cuts and holes.,
Rotate your tires every 6,000 miles (9,700 km) driven.,
Keep your tires properly aligned.",How to Extend the Life of Your Car Tires," Unscrew the cap on your tire's air intake and hold a tire pressure gauge against it, allowing air to flow out of the tire and into the gauge. All tires on your vehicle should be evenly inflated.


If you don't know the proper tire pressure for your vehicle, consult with the vehicle owner's manual.
Additionally, all tires imprint recommended tire pressure directly onto the tire. The recommended pressure of the car manufacturer and the tire manufacturer may vary slightly, as promoting a lower pressure improves drive performance, while a higher pressure extends the life of the tire.
However, avoid over-inflating your tires, as this may cause extensive tread wear in the center of the tire.;
, Roads are full of debris, some of which is sharp such as glass and nails. A nail in a tire may not cause an immediate flat tire, but could result in a slow leak of tire pressure or a future flat tire.


To avoid changing a tire roadside, repair any small cuts and holes you find on your tires, and replace tires with large holes or abrasions in them.

, You may find it most convenient to rotate your tires every other time you get an oil change. You can rotate your tires yourself or visit a mechanic to do the job.


If you choose to rotate your own tires, use a reliable car jack to avoid injuries, and trade wheels between axles, keeping them on the same side of the car.
Avoid switching tires on the same axle, or moving them in a criss-cross pattern. Keeping your tires rotated will promote even tread wear.

, Unless you are a licensed or experienced mechanic, tire alignment is best left to the professionals.


Every vehicle is different, as are tires. A mechanic uses special equipment to balance and align tires, ensuring that your tires remain perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other.
Signs of distorted wheel alignment include poor vehicle handling, consistent pulling of the vehicle to the right or left or crookedness of the steering wheel. Also, check your wheel alignment if you hit a major pothole or curb at a high rate of speed.

",How to Clean Chrome Wheels," Hose off your wheels to loosen and remove any stuck on dirt. This could include dust, dirt, mud, or brake dust., Clean all of your wheels one at a time rather than doing each step for each wheel. Spray a non-acidic wheel cleaner onto the wheel. Use a soft bristled brush, a microfiber cloth, or a sponge to scrub down and clean the wheels. Make sure you poke through the wheel spokes and clean in between the nooks and crannies.Also, don’t forget to clean around the lug nuts of the wheel. Areas around the lug nuts can trap a lot of dirt.


Some good chrome and wheel cleaner brands include Griot’s, Mothers, or Wolfgang.When you are finished wiping down the wheels, thoroughly rinse the wheels with clean water.

, The wheel wells are the metal spaces up and surrounding the wheels of the car. They are a part of the actual body of the car. To clean the wheel wells, you can use an all-purpose cleanser and a stiff bristle brush.This is an area of the car where you can be a little bit rougher cleaning.


Once you are finished cleaning the wheel wells, rinse them with clean water.

, Use a microfiber cloth to wipe down the wheels and prevent water stains from forming on the rims.You can also try drying your chrome wheels with dryer sheets., Use a soft rag to apply a small amount of chrome polish to your wheel. Be sure to polish each wheel individually before moving onto the others.

, If you have a polishing ball that can be attached to a power drill, this is the time to use it.Spread the wax all over the wheel with the polishing ball rotating from the power drill.


If you don’t have a polishing ball, just use a soft cloth to work the polish all over the tire.

, Once the polish starts to dry out, use a soft, microfiber cloth to wipe the wheel and collect any excess polish.Repeat this process for all four of your wheels.

Find a waterless cleaner.,
Spray the rim thoroughly.,
Rub it down.",How to Clean Black Rims1," You can find a number of waterless cleaners on the market. These cleaners are relatively effective on wheels, and they can make it fast and easy to detail your black rims. Also, you'll need several microfiber cloths throughout the process.Look for one that says ""waterless"" on the bottle, such as Chemical Guys Waterless Car Wash and Wax.
Consider getting black, edgeless microfiber cloths. Because they are edgeless, they are less likely to scratch your rims.
Waterless cleaners can be used on any kind of rim. However, make sure it is safe for the type of finish you have, which is most likely a painted aluminum alloy. You don't want to use anything harder than you'd use on your car's finish.;
, The rim needs to be covered in the cleaner as you start cleaning it. Spray it down well. It doesn't need to be dripping off, but the whole surface of the rim needs to have the cleaner on it so it can start breaking down the gunk., Using the microfiber cloth, rub the rim down. Make sure to get in all the nooks and crannies to get all the dirt out. Rub both the spokes and the inside edges of the wheels, as it can all get dirty from road debris and brake dust."

Once you have your safety equipment in place, move on to the next step.If you get any of the chemicals on your skin, clean it off with soap and water. Leaving the chemicals untreated can cause irritation.;
, Make sure to unhook the negative cable first, then follow with the positive cable. The negative cable is the black cable, and the positive is the red. You risk getting a shock if you touch the positive first. When putting the connection back on the terminals, connect in reverse order (positive then negative). Replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems if damage is extensive.If you see any cracks or damage on the battery, do not touch the battery. You will need a professional to have the battery replaced.If the connections are too tight, try using WD-40 to loosen them., Check to see if there are any other issues with the battery during this process. If there are any other cracks or seepage, find a professional to replace the battery for you.

, The scoop of baking soda should be one heaping scoop. Since baking is low in pH, it will help neutralize the acidity of the corrosion. Use hot water rather than cold to speed up the process.Avoid using household ""cleaners"" like coke, coffee, or grease as they can run onto various parts of your engine. This may cause unnecessary corrosion on metal parts, soften rubber connections, and damage your asphalt or concrete driveway., You may also choose to pour on small amounts onto the cables. Gently brush around the connections, thoroughly getting around the base as well as cleaning the build up on the connections. Continue until the battery stops reacting to the baking soda mixture.Don't use a wire brush or reamers as they can potentially remove necessary materials. If you remove too much material, the clamp may not tighten as it should, and you will have loose connection., Ensure that all the materials and mixtures have been rinsed from the battery and connection. Avoid getting the mixture onto the battery compartment itself.

Soak a sponge in the bucket of cleaner and water. Squeeze the sponge over the bucket to avoid wasting the cleaner.
Scrub the wheels with the sponge. Because you already rinsed and lightly rubbed off much of the dirt, hard scrubbing should not damage the alloy wheels.
Use an old toothbrush to clean the crevices in the wheels.

, Spray the wheels with a hose to remove the cleaner solution. Do one wheel at a time to prevent solution from drying on the wheels when you clean all four at once.

,, The following solutions are mildly acidic and should not be left on the surface more than a couple of minutes before they are rinsed and dried thoroughly.


Use aluminum foil and cola to remove rust. Sand the wheels with a piece of aluminum foil soaked in cola.
Clean grease from alloy wheels with vinegar. Use either cider or white vinegar, as both remove grease.

This type of cleaner will specify that you need to spray the wheel with water or wipe it down with water afterwards. It won't say ""waterless."", It's important to follow the directions for whatever cleaner you choose to use. However, with most rim cleaners, you spray down the wheel before applying the cleaner. If the directions say not to, though, skip this step., For many cleaning solutions, all you need to do is spray the cleaner on. For others, you may need to add water and apply it with a sponge or brush. Follow the directions on the bottle for your specific cleaner., Use a brush to suds up the cleaning solution. Make sure you use a brush that's appropriate for that type of finish. For instance, aluminum alloy is fairly delicate, so you don't want anything too abrasive. As you move around the rim, make sure you get in all the crevices., Once you've cleaned the rim thoroughly, rinse the solution off. A hose is fine for this purpose. Make sure you get all the soap off, as it can make it difficult to apply the wax if you don't.You can also use a sopping sponge to help get the grime off instead of a hose.

This finish has wax, of course, but it also contains other additives. The additives are important because they help the finish stay on the wheels for longer than just plain wax.Alternatively, you can use a rub-on wax. Either way, consider using a black wax to keep the wax from leaving white streaks on your black wheels.In fact, if your wheels are a clear gloss painted surface, you can use a black wax like you would use on your car. However, it's best to only use a black wax if your rims are glossy, not matte., If you're using a spray-on wax, be sure to use a piece of cardboard or paper to shield the brake pad from the wax, then spray on the wax. For a rub-on wax, use a clean microfiber cloth to rub the wax in.For both kinds of wax, smear it on first, making sure you get it all over the wheel, as well as in all the crevices. Then, with a clean side of the microfiber cloth, buff out any smears, making it shiny.However, if you're using black spreadable wax on glossy wheels, try to avoid getting it in the crevices. Just use an applicator sponge to rub it gently over the surface of the wheel, making sure to get a solid coat."

This will smooth out the surface and allow for a super shine finish.;
, A variable speed buffer with a lambs wool pad will be necessary to do a nice job. Single speed buffers are not recommend because of the increased chance of burning the finish down to the color coat.

,,  Keep the buffer moving and watch how the finish is changing to a high gloss. 

, Don't overdo it.

,, This may be terry cloth or foam.

, You can run the buffer at a higher speed for this step.  If there are swirl marks remaining on the finish you can also purchase a swirl mark remover. This will give you a professional high gloss finish.

Use a high speed buffer to achieve the finest results.,
Select a random orbital buffer for great results and a nice sheen with minor effort.,
Choose manual buffing if cost is an issue.,
Purchase a polishing or compound product that will achieve the desired results with your car.",How to Buff a Car2," High speed buffers will eliminate surface scratches and blemishes completely, leaving behind a brilliant shine. However, training is recommended to master a high speed buffer. Improper use of a high speed buffer can strip the paint and damage the finish permanently by leaving swirls and scratches.

, No training is required and the random orbital buffer is easy to use. Not all damage will be eliminated but the end result will be a great shine. Random orbital buffers also use significantly less compound than a high speed buffer, therefore a more cost-effective solution. The results will not last as long as with a high speed buffer.

, However, manual buffing is the most labor intensive option that will give the least effective results. Manual buffing takes much longer than high speed and random orbital buffing and the finish will not last as long with manual buffing. Manual buffing requires the least amount of equipment, but requires the most of amount of product and time. The results are usually an uneven finish that will not last as long as alternative buffing means.

, Compound is needed if there are deep scratches in the finish. Polisher is used if the body paint is in great shape already and just needs an increased shine. Product needs will also vary based on the car model, the car year, and the overall condition of the car. Both products can be used with the buffer. Get product recommendations from friends or reputable car aficionados.

Check the inflation pressure.,

Check the valve caps.,

Check for signs of irregular wear.,

Check for damage.",How to Do an Easy Tyre Safety Check," The best time to check this is when the tyres are cold. When testing them, check against the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for tyre inflation and make sure that yours reflect this properly.
, It is important to see if the valve caps are tight so that the possibility of air leakage is minimized, along with preventing the entry of dirt into the tyres. Tighten if necessary., If there are any signs of irregular wear on your tyres, this may indicate a need for wheel alignment, rotation of the tyres and balancing. Check ahead in enough time to book the car in if this is needed., Damage to tyres may not necessarily result in an instant puncture but you may have foreign objects gradually working their way through your tyres. Look for nails embedded in the tread, sidewall damage and stone damage. Have the tyre repaired before you undertake your big trip."

Use a specialized cleaner.,
Wet the tires and cleaning pad.,
Apply the cleaning product.,
Scrub tires thoroughly.,
Rinse off your tires.",How to Clean White Wall Tires1," Look for a specialized whitewall tire cleaner in the automotive section of a department store or hardware store. Regular cleaners like Comet can work well to remove dirt and discoloration on the tires, but they can dry out the tires in the process, leading to early wear. Cleaning products containing alcohol or chlorine bleach should be avoided for the same reason.For the best results, opt for all-natural whitewall tire cleaners (e.g. Simple Green).;
, Use an SOS pad for regular cleaning of whitewall tires. Use a hose to wet the tires. Wet the SOS pad as well., If your chosen tire cleaning product is in spray form, spray it directly onto wet tires. If it is a liquid, mix the product in a bucket with water (as per the directions on the label). Soak your SOS pad in the mixture.

, Put a generous effort into cleaning your whitewall tires thoroughly. The effectiveness of the cleaning is just as contingent on the duration and intensity of the scrubbing as it is to the products used. If the work is too intense to tackle on your own, enlist the help of a friend or family member., Rinse your tires every few minutes while you wash them to see how clean they are getting. Reapply your cleaning product and continue until you are satisfied with the results after rinsing. After you have scrubbed your tires clean, use the hose to rinse them off thoroughly."
"
Use baking soda.,
Try eraser cleaning pads.,
Use sand paper to remove stubborn yellowing.",How to Clean White Wall Tires2," Sprinkle baking soda onto a damp cloth or sponge. Wipe the surface of your whitewall tires in small, circular motions. Rinse the tires clean.Rinse the cloth and reapply baking soda every few minutes until you're satisfied with the results.

, To whiten your tires, try eraser cleaning pads (like Mr. Clean Magic Eraser pads). Wet both the pad and your tires and wipe the tires down in small, circular motions. For best results, rinse or replace the pads between tires., If tires remain yellowed after persistent cleaning, sand the top layer of the white part with fine, dry sand paper. Sand away the yellowed layer slowly and gently until a bright white layer emerges underneath. Rinse tires clean with the hose."
"
Clean them at least every two weeks.,
Use tire dressing.,
Give them ample space in storage.",How to Clean White Wall Tires3," To keep your whitewall tires clean and avoid having to give them a heavy duty cleaning, take the time to wash them at least every two weeks. Use water, whitewall tire cleaner and a rag or sponge. If you do this cleaning frequently enough (e.g. every week), a gentle soap should be effective enough to use.If there is persistent dirt or discoloration, which is less likely if tires are regularly cleaned, use a stronger whitewall tire cleaner and scrub pad.

, After cleaning whitewall tires, use a water-based dressing to give your tires shine and protect them from harmful UV rays. Purchase the dressing and a foam applicator for it in the automotive department of most department stores, or online. Apply the foam to the applicator and wipe it onto your tires evenly until the desired effect is reached., When storing your whitewall tires, give them ample space so that they don't have to lean against each other. This may cause the black rubber of the tires to rub against the white rubber, smudging them. If you do have to lean them against each other, separate the tires with plastic sheeting or store them in individual bags."

Rub the wax into the rims.,
Remove excess wax with a microfiber cloth.",How to Clean Rims," Don’t wash the rims right after driving. Let the car rest with the engine off. It can take hours for the entire car to cool, but you can test the rim temperature by moving your fingers close. When the rims feel cool to the touch, you can clean them.

On warm rims, water and cleaner may leave stains.;
, Get a mop bucket or other large water container. Fill it ¾ full with lukewarm water. This only needs to be done if you plan on using a liquid soap.

Spray-on cleaners are also available and can be used to avoid having to mix soap and water. Look for brands such as Eagle One, Meguiars, and Mothers., Add a teaspoon of wheel cleaner for every gallon (3.79 L) of water. Wheel cleaners can be found at general stores or automotive stores. You may instead use a neutral pH, non-abrasive detergent such as Dawn.

Remember to stick to an all-purpose cleaner unless you know what type of wheel and rim you have. Aluminum is the most common rim variety, but there are also others, such as chrome. In addition, there are various wheel coatings that can be worn away by using the wrong cleaner., Work one rim at a time. Before applying the cleaner, spray down the rims with a hose. If you don’t have a hose, at least fill a bucket with clean, warm water. Use a rag or sponge to dampen the wheel. Rinsing removes some debris and helps loosen the rest, so let the rim soak for a couple of minutes., Water should have soaked into the debris, making scrubbing easier. Use a wheel scrub brush, rag, sponge, or spray bottle to cover the rim with your cleaner.

When using a commercial cleaner, be sure to read the label. Look for the recommended amount of time the cleaner should be allowed to rest on the rim.

, Wheel brushes of various sizes will help you reach every area in the rims. Start at the topmost opening and use a large brush to reach the back of the rim. Use smaller brushes to clear dust from bolts, lug nut holes, and the air valve. Afterwards, scrub the front and back of the rim and its spokes.A rough rag or sponge can be used instead of specialized brushes. Also, a wheel wash mitt can help you reach behind the rim and a toothbrush can help you clean hard-to-reach areas.
If you are using brushes, you may wish to soften them first. Soak them in your soap mixture for a few minutes.

, As you scrub, you will notice your scrubbing tool gathering soap and debris. Dip the brush in a bucket of clean water to clean it. Make sure all of the soap and debris is gone before you return the brush to the soap mixture.By not rinsing your scrubber, you may reintroduce brake dust, snow salt, and other grime which can permanently discolor or even corrode your rims.

, As soon as you are finished scrubbing, remove the cleaner. Spray down the wheel with a hose or dip a rag or sponge into clean water. Don’t allow the soap to sit on the rims. Be sure to rinse off the back side of the rims as well as the outside of the tire., Move on to the next rim. Rinse it off and then scrub it with soap and water. Do this for the remaining three rims., When you’ve finished cleaning all four rims, use a microfiber towel to remove leftover moisture from the rims. To remove water from tight spaces, such as the lug nut holes, you can try compressed air, a leaf blower, or a quick drive around the block.Make sure you note which rags you’ve used on the wheels. These may have gathered brake dust, which will scratch your car’s paint. Save these rags for wheel cleaning only.

, Wax can be bought at auto-part stores or wherever else you may have found your rim cleaner. Look for a wax jelly such as carnauba wax. Applying the wax after each cleaning protects your wheels from brake dust and makes future cleanings easier., Dip a clean cloth into the product. You may also do this with a wheel wash mitt, which can make reaching behind the rim simpler., Spread the wax over each rim. Don’t forget to reach behind the rims. Get the front and back of each spoke along with the faces. Also cover the outside edges and the spaces between the spokes. Let the wax rest for three minutes., Use a clean cloth to go back over the rim. The wax should have settled onto the rims, leaving a protective coating."

Use a cleaner designed for tires.,
Allow the cleaner to sit for a minute.,
Use a stiff brush to clean tires.,
Rinse the tires with a hose.,
Repeat the cleaner process if necessary.,
Use tire gel for browned tires.",How to Clean the Tires on Your Car1," There are a number of products designed specifically to clean your tires. Spray tire cleaner onto your tires and follow the directions regarding how long to leave it on.Car wash soap is designed to clean and protect paint and clear coat, not rubber, so it can leave a film over your tires or prevent them from shining.
Just as car wash soap does a poor job of cleaning tires, tire cleaner can have a negative effect on the paint of your vehicle. Do your best to avoid getting any on the paint.
There are some cleaners designed for use on both wheels and tires. If you did not purchase cleaner designed for both applications, avoid getting tire cleaner on your wheels.;
, Because rubber is a fairly porous surface, it can be difficult to get the grime and brake dust off of your tires. Allow the tire cleaner to sit on the tire for a minute or two, so it can soak in and dislodge as much dirt and grime as possible.Follow the instructions regarding how long to let the tire cleaner sit on the tire for optimal effect.
Wipe any overspray on the wheels or paint off immediately with a clean rag.

, If your tires have a white film or have browned due to deposits of grime, you may need to scrub them to get them clean. Use a brush with fairly stiff bristles and don’t be afraid to apply a lot of pressure when scrubbing your tires clean for the best results.It does not matter if you scrub your tires in a back and forth or circular motion as long as you are consistent throughout the tire.
Use a stiffer brush than you would on paint, but avoid steel tooth brushes as they may penetrate the rubber and lead to leaks.

, After scrubbing as much grime off of the tire as you can, use a hose to rinse the tire off. Use a power washer or high pressure hose if possible to limit the amount of dirt that remains on the tire.Tire cleaners are designed to be environmentally safe, so it’s fine to allow the tire cleaner and water to drain or run off into your yard.
Be sure to wear eye protection if using a pressure washer.

, After scrubbing the tire with tire cleaner on it and rinsing it off, there may still be a white or brown film left on the tire. Reapply tire cleaner and allow it to set again, then scrub and rinse the tires a second time to remove as much road grime as possible.Read the instructions on the tire cleaner you purchased. Some may specify that they should be applied to dry rubber. If that is the case, wait for the tire to dry before reapplying.
Repeat the cleaning and scrubbing process as needed for your desired level of clean.

, If your tires are still brown after a thorough cleaning, you may choose to use a tire gel to return the rubber to its original shade of black. There are a number of types of tire gel, but most are applied with a sponge to the entire sidewall of the tire. Apply the gel and then rinse it off one tire at a time to avoid letting it dry out on the tire.Tire gels can undo rubber browning from age.
It is best to apply tire gel to an already cleaned tire.

Dry tires with their own towel.,
Apply tire dressing.,
Use a tire coating or tire clear coat.,
Allow the tire coating to dry, then buff it off.",How to Clean the Tires on Your Car2," Use a towel you will not use on the rest of the vehicle. Using a tire towel on the car could result in scratching the clear coat or paint with dirt it picked up on the tire.Dry the sidewalls of the tire completely before moving on.
The treaded portion of the tire is not easy to see or to clean, so focus primarily on the sidewall as it is the most visible.

, Read the ingredient labels when choosing a tire dressing and pick one that does not contain silicone. Choose a water based tire dressing that will not provide as brilliant an immediate shine, but will require less upkeep to maintain. In nearly all applications you should apply the tire dressing evenly in thin coats using the supplied sponge by simply wiping it on as though you are painting the sidewall.You can apply multiple coats of water based tire dressing to achieve the same shine possible from silicone based ones.
Follow the directions on the label for the specific brand of your choice.
Allow tire dressing to dry before driving the vehicle.

, Instead of tire dressing, you may also choose to apply a tire coating that creates a glossy protective layer over the rubber of your tire. Some tire coating is fairly permanent, protecting the rubber for months in even extreme weather. Apply tire coating with the supplied sponge in a thin layer over the entire sidewall.You do not need to apply much tire coating to have a significant effect on the darkness and shine of the tire.
Follow the directions provided with the tire coating you choose carefully for best results.

, Depending on the brand of tire coating you choose, it may take up to an hour for it to dry. Once it has, use the supplied buffing pad or a microfiber towel to buff the tire coating off. Once buffed, the tire will look like a new tire.Buff the tire coating off in a circular motion.
Some tire coating can be buffed immediately after application while others may need to dry completely beforehand. Read the directions on your to be sure.

Clean the wheels and tires first.,
Use a separate bucket for your wheels and tires.,
Avoid getting tire cleaner on the wheels or paint.",How to Clean the Tires on Your Car3," Because your wheels and tires are usually the dirtiest part of the vehicle, washing them first will prevent you from splattering dirt and grime on a clean car as you wash and rinse the tires.Washing the car after the tires gives you a chance to clean off any tire or wheel cleaner you accidentally get onto the car’s paint.

, Your wheels and tires are not only covered in dirt, but also brake dust caused by the wearing of your brake pads when you stop. This dust can create small scratches in paint, so it’s important to keep the bucket, sponges, and towels you use on your wheels and tires away from those you use on your paint.Keep one bucket with sponges for washing the car and another for the wheels and tires.
Never use a sponge or towel you used on your wheels and tires on the body of the car.

, Tire cleaner can dull paint or even remove wax or clear coat from the body of your car. It is designed to eat through stuck on grime and the chemicals can even be harsh enough to damage painted or powder coated wheels. Take care when applying tire cleaners and immediately wipe any overspray off.If you use a wheel and tire cleaner in one, it is okay to get it on your wheels.
Some wheel and tire cleaner is only designed for specific types of wheels, so read the instructions carefully before spraying your wheels with the cleaner.

Repeat the entire process for each coil spring that you will replace on the car.

",How to Cut Coil Springs," Use a jack to raise the area of the car from which you will remove the old coil spring. Follow the instructions that come with your jack.
,


Take the hub cap off of the wheel.
Unscrew the nuts and remove the tire.

, The strut holds the coil spring and the shock absorbers over the tires, and allows for a smooth ride. Follow the owner's manual for your car to remove the strut.

, Use a tape measure to measure the length of the coil spring while it is still compressed in the extended strut.

, Use a coil compressor to remove the coil spring. A coil compressor allows you to remove the spring while it is still compressed, and to safely and gradually decompress the spring. Follow the instructions that come with the coil compressor.

,


Locate the dead coils on the spring. The dead coils are the coils on one end of the spring that touch each other. These coils do not move with the spring as it tenses and flexes.
Measure out the distance of the old compressed coil spring from the other end of the spring.
Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to that number. If your old compressed coil spring measured 12 inches (30.5 cm), the new length will be 13 inches (33 cm). This measurement is the shortest possible length to which the new coil spring can be cut. If you cut the coil spring shorter than this total measurement, you will not be able to use the new coil spring in your car.
Mark the place where you will cut the new coil spring with a bright-colored marker.

, Use a hacksaw or an angle grinder to cut the coil spring. An angle grinder is a small tool that uses a disc to grind or cut objects. The angle grinder's metal wheel should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter.

,


Place the new cut coil spring into the strut.
Re-install the strut. Follow the owner's manual of your car to re-install the strut.

Know the age of the tires you are buying.,
Buy tires that are no more than five years old.,
Test the rubber integrity by pinching about three inches (8 cm) of the sidewall and looking carefully for small cracks, dry rot, or discoloration.,
Examine the tires carefully to determine if they were repaired.,
Make sure your tires are matched sets - one set for the front and one set for the rear.,
Check tread wear patterns.,
Check the tread depth.,
Match the tire that is already on the same axle.

,
Choose a tire with as much tread (or more) than the tire you already have.

,
Reject tires with dry rot, patches, plugs, or uneven wear.

,
Pick the exact same tire width and aspect ratio as the existing tire.",How to Choose Used Tires for a Car," Look at the sidewalls for the date stamp on the tire. If you look at the sidewall you will see a code beginning with the letters “DOT” (for the Department of Transportation). One of these codes will be four digits longer than the others and those extra digits are the date stamp. It is in a week/year (WW/YY) format, so, 0705 would be the 7th week of 2005 and 5107 would be the 51st week of 2007.;
, Tires older than that may fail prematurely due to inevitable deterioration of the rubber, a process often called dry rot. Tires exposed to UV are especially prone to failure as the radiation energy from the sun breaks some of the chemical bonds in the tires, allowing the rubber to oxidize more quickly.

, Do this in several places around the most weathered side of each tire. If you are not sure which side is most weathered, take the time to check both sidewalls.


Reject any tires that show small cracks or signs of dry rot. These tires are prone to early failure and are inherently unsafe.

, Look on the inside of the tires for such things as plugs and patches.


Reject any tires with these flaws. Though they are probably safe, better tires can be had, usually for the same price.
Alternatively, you might reasonably ask if a discount might be offered based on the inferior tire quality or the defect you have identified.
Don't expect too much, though. Remember, you are buying used tires.

, They should be the same size (width and aspect ratio), have similar tread wear and a similar tread pattern, though the latter is less important and more forgiving.


The height of the tires (from the road surface to the top of the tire) should be the same for both tires on an axle. If not, it puts unnecessary wear on the differential and CV (constant velocity) joints and creates handling and safety concerns.
The tires are labelled P ### / ## R ## (S ##) where P represents the use (P is for passenger cars), # represents a single numeric digit, R stands for radial, and S is a letter code for the speed rating. Nearly all passenger car tires these days are radial.

The first set of three digits molded on the tire sidewall (for example 265) is the width of the tire from inner sidewall to outer sidewall (with the tire mounted on the car and inflated to a specified pressure). This unit is given in mm. An example might be 265 indicating that 265 mm is the largest tire width (measured straight across the tire tread from the bulge in one sidewall to the bulge in the other sidewall).
The first two digit number (typically 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, or 75) is the aspect ratio of the tire given as a percentage. It is the sidewall height (from the bead where the tire seats on the rim to the to tread surface) as a percentage of the tire width (first three digit number). An example might be 70% of 265 mm or 185 mm for a P265/70R15 tire.
The final two digit number is the size of the rim in inches. In almost all cases the rims on your car will all be the same unless you are running a temporary tire (spare).


To get a matched pair of tires or a matched set of four tires, both the tire width and the aspect ratio must match exactly and the tread pattern should be close to the same.

, If there are bald spots, highly uneven wear, or steel belts that are showing or popping out, the tire is a reject for your purposes. Note that nearly every tire shows the most wear on the outside due to cornering.

, To do this, measure what you think is the average tread depth with a depth gauge or a US penny (or similar coin) to judge relative depth. (For this, the top of the portrait head should be toward the tire surface.) Ideally, you would want four tires that all have the same tread depth. If that’s not possible, it is best to make sure that the tires on each axle have equal tread depth as well as you are able.

,,,,


The tread pattern is not that important in this case.

Observe your car from the front.,
Push down on the front of the car to test for weak shock absorbers.,
Visually inspect the struts or shock absorbers.",How to Check Shock Absorbers," With the car on a flat surface, it should appear perfectly level, i.e. both sides being the same height off the surface.


If you actually know the specifications of your car's suspension, you can measure the height. If the height is at or below the minimum specs, then you should take the car to a professional for further evaluation and repair. Being at the ""minimum"" is just that. It is no longer at the ideal, and something has changed.





;
, This is not a scientific test and is somewhat subjective. But it can be helpful when taken in conjunction with other checks made.


Stand in front of the car and carefully place your foot on the bumper, or your knee on a surface that won't dent or bend; it doesn't have to be center. Shift your weight onto that point, pushing the car down. Then quickly remove your foot, or weight. The car should bounce up and return to its original position rather stiffly, without continuing to bounce. If it bounces more than a couple of times, this is an indication that perhaps the shock absorbers are weak.

, Look for signs of liquid that is or has been running down the shock absorber. If present, then your shock absorbers could be bad. Once the seals begin leaking, the shock absorber becomes ineffective.


You will need to get the car into a garage to confirm your observations and replace the shock absorbers. Note that you want to get a confirmation that the liquid tracks you observed are indeed emanating from leaking shock absorber seals. It could easily just be something splashed up from the road.

Look for a wear indicator.,
Raise the front end of the car.,
Rock the wheels and check for play.,
Look for the grease fitting.,
Jack up the car on the front cross-member.,
Use your hand to check the up-down play on the ball joint.,
Listen.",How to Check Ball Joints," While the vehicle is still on the ground, look underneath the car, on the bottom of the steering knuckle attached to the wheel. The most common indicator is a grease fitting that doubles as a wear indicator. That fitting, or boss, will stick out of the bottom of the joint’s housing by about half an inch (1.25 centimeters). As it wears the boss will recede into the housing. As long as the boss protrudes out, the joint should be fine. Once the boss is flush with the housing or has receded even further, you’ll need to replace the ball joint.This applies to older cars. Most new cars do not have wear indicators, or a grease fitting. If you can’t find a wear indicator, or if the indicator doesn’t give you a clear enough sign, raise up the car to inspect the joint more thoroughly.;
, To check a loaded lower ball joint, the manufacturer will recommend that you place a jack under the lower control arm of the front wheel, as close to the ball joint as you can, then raise the vehicle until the wheel leaves the ground. If you don't do this, tension will still be on the ball joint when you jack up the car, making it difficult to move and look for play on the joint.


Make sure there is no compression in the suspension when you check the ball joint. If you have control arms of unequal lengths, make sure the upper bump stop doesn’t touch the control arm.

, Make sure your car is jacked securely. The vehicle must be on frame stands when jacked up and you are working on the vehicle. Move dial indicator to the side of the nut or to the side of the spindle and move the wheel in and out to check radial wear.


For vertical play, place the dial indicator against the steering knuckle stud nut or the ball joint housing, depending on the manufacturer. Grab the wheel at the top and bottom (12 and 6 o’clock) to lift up and pull down. Move the dial gauge to the side of the nut and grab the tire at the bottom and move it in and out to check radial play of the joint.
Read the dial indicator and check against the manufacturer’s specifications. If the movement is beyond specifications, replace the ball joint.
Experienced mechanics will also just check play by the feel, listening closely for any clicking or easy motion that suggests the ball joint is worn out. Alternatively, you could have a helper look closely at the joint itself to see if it appears loose as you move it.

, If your front suspension uses McPherson struts, look for a wear indicator, which is usually a grease fitting. Grasp the fitting and try to wiggle it. If the fitting moves around inside the housing, you’ll need to replace the ball joint.

, Many front wheel drive cars with strut suspensions should not be jacked up using the lower control arm, so it's a good idea to consult your owner's manual before attempting to inspect the joint. In general, you're going to want to jack the car up in the directed place as you normally would, on the crossing member of the frame.


Let the McPherson struts extend as far out as you can before you try to check the wheels for play.

, Rock the lower part of the wheel around to see if there is any play in the joint. If there is any play in the joint, it must be replaced.

, The ball joint assembly in a vehicle with strut suspension should be silent. Any clicking sound when you move it up indicates it's worn out and not working smoothly as it should. If you notice significant play, you need to change the ball joint.


Alternatively, have someone look at the ball joint while you attempt to move it. It'll shudder slightly and look insecure if it needs to be replaced.

, If any part of Lincoln’s head is obscured by the tire tread, your tires are fine. Otherwise, your treads are too shallow and you should replace them.

, Continue the penny test around the tire about every 15”. Check the central grooves and the inner and outer grooves. This will tell you if your tire has uneven wear.

, Tires do not wear evenly so be sure to check the tread on each tire to determine that the tread depth for each is safe.

Obtain a tire gauge from an auto store or auto department of a hardware store.,
Determine how much air should be in your tires.,
Check the air in your tires when the tires are cold.,
Unscrew the cap off of the tire's valve stem.

,
Place the tire gauge onto the tire valve stem.

,
Press the tire gauge firmly down on top of the valve stem.,
Read the gauge to gain information about the PSI or KPA in your tires.,
Carry out the process with all 4 tires to maintain a balance among them.

,
Gain access to air either by getting an air hose and compressor ready or putting money into an air machine.

,
Place the air hose nozzle over the open valve stem.

,
Add pressure to the nozzle as you did with the tire gauge.,
Allow a small burst of air to go inside of the tire.

,
Remove the hose when the burst is complete.

,
Use the tire gauge to see the new pressure of air in the tire.,
Replace the valve stem cap.

",How to Check and Add Air to Car Tires,"


Simple gauges work well. Digital gauges are not necessary.
Gauge prices range from a couple of dollars to $20.
Tire gauges measure pounds per square inch (standard) or kilo Pascal's (metric).;
, This will be printed on a sticker on the inside of the driver's side door or in the owner's manual. If you can't find the sticker, it may also be located inside the glove box door or fuel door.


Look at the writing on the side of your tires. The tire will have a maximum PSI or KPA number. This is the maximum pounds per square inch or kilo Pascal's that your tires can handle. It is not advisable to fill your tires to this pressure.







, Try checking the tires first thing in the morning after the car has been turned off all night.

Allow the car to sit for 30 minutes to three hours before checking air in car tires for the most accurate reading.






If you must drive to check the air in your tires, try to make the trip less than 1 mile (1.6 km).







,,,


Some air may escape when you begin applying pressure. However, the air should stop leaking out once the pressure is increased and the gauge is evenly on the valve.

,


Standard gauges will blow out a stick. The notch on the stick where it stopped when blown out is the reading.
Digital gauges will give a digital number as the reading.

,,,,


The nozzle is on correctly when air stops leaking from the outside of the tire and is going inside of the tire.

,,,


Do not go over 5 PSI or KPA than is recommended for your tires.
If the pressure is still too low, add another small burst of air and recheck the pressure.
Continue the process until the PSI is met.
If you put too much air in the tire, press against the pin in the valve stem with the gauge and let a small amount of air release from the tire. Recheck the tire pressure.

If you run into problems while attempting to change your wheel bearing or have doubts after you finish, it's very wise to enlist the help of a professional mechanic. Doing so can save time, prevent future headaches, and save money in the long run.;
, As with most types of auto maintenance, you'll want to take all necessary precautions when changing your vehicle's wheel bearings to ensure your safety. The worst thing that can happen when changing your wheel bearings is for your vehicle to suddenly shift or roll away. Before you begin, park your vehicle on a level surface. Put the vehicle in park (or, for manuals, 1st, reverse, or neutral) and be sure to put the parking brake up.

, For added stability, it can be smart to use sturdy chocks to hold your vehicle's wheels in place. Obviously, you'll want to use chocks on the wheels you don't plan on modifying, as the wheels you do modify will be elevated off the ground. For example, you would place wheel chocks behind the rear tires if you are fixing a front wheel bearing and behind the front tires if you are working on a rear wheel.

, For proper access to the internal components of the wheel whose bearings you're replacing, you'll need to elevate the wheel. Luckily, most vehicles come with a jack for just this purpose. Before you lift the wheel, however, you may want to slightly loosen the lug nuts with a tire iron, as breaking their initial resistance is harder without the ground holding the wheel steady. After this, carefully lift your wheel. If your vehicle doesn't come with a jack, you may need to buy a suitable jack at an auto supply store. See wikiHow's guide on how to change a tire for help elevating your vehicle's wheel.


To prevent dangerous slippage, make sure that the vehicle is securely seated on the jack and that the jack is flush with the ground before attempting to lift the wheel. It's also important to make sure the jack touches the vehicle on a sturdy, metal piece of the undercarriage, rather than on fragile plastic molding, as the weight of the vehicle can damage the latter.
Most vehicles have jack points where the frame has extra support to lift the vehicle. It's best to check the owners manual to learn the best place to position your jack.
It is also extremely wise to use a safety jack stand for added support in the event the floor or scissor jack fails.

, The lug nuts, which you should have already loosened, should come off easily. Remove these and put them in a safe place where you won't lose them. Next, remove the wheel itself. It should come freely.


Some like to keep track of the lugnuts by removing the hubcap, turning it over, and using it as a sort of ""plate"" to contain them.

, Using a socket and a ratchet, remove the caliper's bolts. Then, remove the caliper itself using a screwdriver.


When removing the caliper, be careful not to let it dangle freely, as this can damage the brake hose. Instead, hook it on a secure part of the undercarriage or use a short length of string to tie it in place. A bungee cord or a bent wire hanger are two additional ways to secure the caliper.

, In the center of the vehicle's exposed rotor should be a small metal or plastic cap called the dust cover which protects the components holding the rotor in place. Since you'll need to remove the rotor, the cap and the components it protects will have to go. Usually, the dust cover can be removed by gripping it with calipers and tapping the calipers with a hammer. Inside, you'll find the castle nut, usually secured with a cotter pin. Remove the cotter pin with pliers or wire cutters, then unscrew the castle nut and remove it (and its washer).


Be sure to keep these small but important parts somewhere that they won't be lost!

, Place your thumb securely on the peg in the middle of the rotor assembly. Firmly (but somewhat gently) bump the rotor itself with the palm of your other hand. The wheel's outer bearing should loosen or fall out. Remove the outer bearing. Finally, remove the rotor itself.


If the rotor gets stuck, you can use a rubber mallet to hit it loose. This can, however, damage the rotor, so it's best to use a mallet only if you are not planning on reusing the same rotor.

, The wheel bearing is inside the hub, which is usually held in place with several bolts that screw in from behind. These bolts can be tricky to reach because they're tucked away in the undercarriage, so you may want to use a skinny socket wrench and/or a breaker bar to loosen and remove them. When you've removed the bolts, take the hub off of the axle.


Note that if you've purchased a new hub assembly, at this point, you can install the new hub and put the wheel back together and you'll be finished. To install a new set of bearings inside the hub, read on.

, To gain access to the bearings, you'll need to take apart the hub. You'll probably need to use a wrench (and/or a hammer) to remove the end of the hub and any anti-lock brake wheel that may be part of your hub. Then, you may need to use a specialized ""puller"" tool to remove the central bolt. The bearing assembly should come apart easily.

, Removing the bearing assembly's races usually means physically breaking them with a grinder or hammer and chisel. Because of this, you'll want to have replacement races ready. After removing the races, it's a good idea to clean the inside of the bearing assembly around the knuckle.


There's usually lots of grease and grime here, so have plenty of rags handy.

, Set new races in place in the bearing assembly with a few taps from a hammer. Finally, grease a new inner bearing and install it in the assembly. Ensure the bearings are properly aligned, that they're pushed in as far as they can go, and that any sealing rings are flush with the outside of the assembly.


Use lots of grease for your bearings. You can apply the grease by hand or with a special ""bearing packer"" tool. Rub plenty of extra grease around the outsides of your bearings and any sealing rings.

, Now that you've changed the bearings, basically all that's left to do is to re-build your vehicle's wheel. Don't forget, however, that this means installing a new outer bearing after the rotor is in place. Put the hub assembly back together and install it on the axle shaft. Put the rotor back on and secure it in place with its bolts. Install a new, well-greased outer bearing at this point. Lightly tighten the castle nut and secure it in place with a new cotter pin. Replace the dust cap. Put the caliper and brake pads back in place and secure them with the appropriate bolts. Finally, put the tire back in place and secure it with lug nuts.


When you're all done, carefully lower the car back down to the ground with your jack. Congratulations - you've just changed your wheel bearings.

Remove the wheel.,
Remove the brake line support if necessary.,

Remove the bolts from the steering knuckle.,
Open the hood and locate the strut towers to remove the bolts.,
Pull the old strut free.,
If you have access to a spring compressor, consider removing the spring.,
Assemble the new strut.,
Install the completed strut assembly back into the steering knuckle.,
Place the strut assembly back into the strut tower and replace the strut tower bolts.,
Replace the wheel.,
Perform a final check to make sure nothing was incorrectly fitted.,
Repeat the process for all struts you want to change.",How to Change Struts," The struts are cylinder-shaped pistons filled with hydraulic fluid, usually shaped a bit like a metallic road cone with a spring wrapped around it.


Open the hood and locate the strut bolts, usually a circle of three bolts on a pan in the engine compartment, to each side of the car, near the windshield. In the center of the ring of bolts will be the bolt for the strut pan itself. Don't loosen any of these bolts yet, especially not the center bolt, but use this to guide you to your working spot.;
, First, loosen the bolts securing the wheel with a lug wrench and lift the car with a jack, positioning the jack according to the Owner's Manual instructions for changing a tire. Once the car is raised, position a jack stand under the car for stability. Remove the bolts that secure the wheel and remove the wheel.









It's always important to use jack stands to secure the car. Do not attempt to do this job only supporting the car on the jack. Jacks can shift suddenly, dropping the car and possibly trapping you under it. Car jacks use hydraulic power that can fail suddenly and need to be backed up by jack stands to do the job safely. Invest in a couple of jack stands.

, You might need to remove the brake line support bracket from the strut assembly. This isn't a feature on all cars, so disregard this step if you don't see a small bracket holding the brake line to the strut.









If you do, unscrew the bracket with the appropriate size socket wrench and move the brake line up and out of the way so you can remove the strut.

, Also called the stabilizer or the anti-roll bar, the sway bar works along with the strut assembly to stabilize the car during bumps and irregular road conditions. To do this, you need to remove the mounting bracket with a socket wrench and rotate the sway bar out of the way.









Look for a small metal bracket attaching a metal bar (usually black) to the strut and remove it. Again, this won't always be an obstacle on all cars; you might just need to loosen the strut from the steering knuckle and free it. Once you've gotten these obstacles out of the way, you're ready to remove the old strut.

, There are most likely two or three large bolts holding the strut to the steering knuckle. Remove these by removing the nuts from the assembly and loosening the strut.









This is often rusted on and difficult to remove. You might choose to spray some rust loosening spray like WD-40 on equal onto the bolts before you can free them. Try hammering a few times on the knuckle itself to loosen things up a bit before hammering directly on the bolts holding the strut to the knuckle. This might take some elbow grease.
Depending on the model of your car, you may also need to place your jack under the steering knuckle to raise it slightly and make the bolts visible. Once the strut bolts are out the strut and steering knuckle are separated.

, Usually they are located at the midpoint of the inside fender well and look like cylinders. They are most likely held in by three small bolts. Remove the strut tower bolts. Do not remove the center nut or the strut will come apart and it is under high spring tension.









Since you've removed the bolts from the steering knuckle, the strut might fall loose after you remove these bolts. It might help to have a partner holding onto the strut assembly while you loosen these bolts.

, Don't unscrew the center bolt on the top of the strut pan until you've compressed the springs, if you're going to. If you've got a quick-strut assembly, you can discard the old strut and skip forward to installing your new fully-assembled strut.









It's recommended that the beginner forego attempts to compress the spring on the old strut using a spring compressor or spring clamps. This method is used to save money by salvaging the old spring and installing it on the new strut, but if you don't have your own strut compressor, it will run you $700. It makes more sense to spend the extra cash on a quick-strut assembly, which is pre-assembled and only requires that you install it in the car.

, Making sure the compressor is secure and pointed away from anything that you do not want damaged, compress the spring with a spring compressor, or have someone more experienced do this.









At the very top of the strut is a large nut on top of what looks like a disc, but is actually the strut bearing. Remove the large nut on top of the strut with ratchet and socket combination, and hold the strut rod with a wrench just below the strut bearing. Make a note of the strut top plate rotation before removal and reinstall in the same position. The strut can now be removed from the spring while the spring is still compressed by the spring compressor. Check the top plate bearing if it needs to be replaced.

, Put the new strut into the spring. Make sure to include any rubber parts from the old strut. Install the strut bearing over the spring and install the new strut rod nut to the manufacture specified torque while holding the strut rod to prevent spinning the strut shaft.









Again, if you've purchased a quick-strut, don't worry about monkeying around with the spring on the old strut. Discard it and skip to installation.

, Replace the bolts, leaving them finger tight, allowing the assembly to move freely.








, Now you can tighten the bolts with your wrench, securing the strut assembly to the steering knuckle and torquing to the manufacturer's specifications.









If you needed to move the sway bar or the brake line support, replace these at this time.

, Tighten the lug bolts finger tight before lowering the car. Jack the vehicle up slightly to remove the load on the jack stands, then remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground. Tighten the wheel to the proper specifications, as well as the strut tower bolts.








, Test drive at low speed to evaluate the vehicle safely. Avoid high speed driving or high-traffic areas. It's possible that the vehicle may require alignment.









If the vehicle pulls to either side or otherwise does not drive normally, perform alignment by measuring the degree of difference and adding cams to adjust the issue., It's cheaper to replace struts on a need-to basis, but they tend to wear out all at once, so you might as well do the rest if you're willing to invest in two or four new struts. The process will work in the same basic way for struts in all positions.









Not all cars have rear struts. Check your owner's manual before buying unnecessary parts.

Open the car's hood.,
Look for the master cylinder.,
Check the fluid level in the reservoir.,
Add brake fluid to the reservoir if required.,
Replace the reservoir cap and close the hood.",How to Check Brake Fluid1," It's best to do this when the car is stopped on a level surface, with the engine cold.






;
, On most cars, the master cylinder is located at the back of the engine bay, on the driver's side. There's a reservoir above the cylinder itself.








, On most newer cars, the reservoir is transparent, with lines marked ""Min"" and ""Max""; the brake fluid level should fall between these lines. Cars older than the 1980s may have metal reservoirs, requiring you to remove the reservoir cap. (Newer caps screw on and off, while some older caps need to be pried off with a screwdriver.)








, Pour the fluid carefully into the reservoir, wiping up any spills, as brake fluid is toxic and corrosive.









Use only the brake fluid with the DOT specification recommended in your owner's manual. There are three main specifications: DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5, each having its own properties. It is possible to use DOT 4 brake fluid in some cars that call for DOT 3 fluid, but never the reverse, and DOT 5 brake fluid can be used only in cars that call for that specification.

,









If the brake fluid level is significantly below the ""Min"" or ""Add"" line, you should have your brakes inspected for excessive wear. As brake pads wear down, brake fluid can channel itself out of the brake lines into the calipers.
It is also possible to have the brake fluid reservoir full and not have the brake fluid reaching the master cylinder. If your brakes feel spongy even with the reservoir full, take your car to a mechanic.

"
"
Check the brake fluid color.,
Dip a chemical test strip into the fluid.,
Test for moisture content with an optical refractometer.,
Evaluate the brake fluid's boiling point with an electronic tester.",How to Check Brake Fluid2," Normally, brake fluid is brown. If the fluid looks dark or black, it may need to be replaced but further testing is needed.








, As brake fluid ages, its corrosion inhibitors break down. Test strips check the presence of copper in the brake fluid; the higher the level, the more worn out the inhibitors are. One such test strip is Phoenix Systems' ""Brake Strip Brake Fluid Test Strip""








, Brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means that over time, it absorbs moisture from its surroundings. Moisture dilutes and weakens the effectiveness of brake fluid, which leads to braking systems components to corrode. In 18 months, brake fluid can have up to 3 percent water, which can lower its boiling point from 40 to 50 percent.








, New DOT 3 specification brake fluid is to have a dry boiling point of 401 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius) and a wet boiling point of 284 degrees (140 degrees Celsius), while DOT 4 fluid is to boil at 446 degrees (230 degrees Celsius) dry and 311 degrees (155 degrees Celsius) wet. The lower the point at which the brake fluid boils, the less effective it is.









Your mechanic should have both an optical refractometer and electronic brake fluid tester to perform these tests for you as part of an automotive checkup.

, On most cars with hydraulic clutches, the clutch fluid reservoir is located near the brake master cylinder at the back of the engine bay but is smaller than the brake fluid reservoir. If in doubt as to where to look, consult with your car's owner's manual.

, The reservoir should either be filled to the top, or filled to between the minimum and maximum lines shown on the reservoir, depending on the car in question. On most newer cars, the reservoir will be made of translucent plastic, while older cars may have metal reservoirs, requiring you to remove the reservoir cap before you can see the fluid level.

, Pour the fluid carefully into the reservoir, wiping up any spills.


Hydraulic clutches use the same type of fluid as hydraulic brake systems. Use the fluid with the DOT specification recommended in your car's owner's manual.

,, For example, if you're changing the right rear tire, then you'll want to block off the left front tire and wheel by using a wheel chock.

,, Your Jeep's spare tire and wheel, as well as the jack, are located underneath of the rear cargo floor. To access these items, open the rear cargo hatch, and open the carpeted rear cargo cover.


To remove the spare tire and wheel, fully loosen the wing nut holding them into place, and set aside the wing nut. Remove the ""J"" hook that secures the spare tire and wheel to the vehicle, and set it aside as well.
Remove the spare tire and wheel from their location, and lay the spare tire and wheel flat on the ground with the outside of the wheel and the tire valve stem facing outwards towards you. Remove the jack from the spare tire storage location.

, The tools that you'll need to jack up your Jeep are located under the right rear passenger's bench seat. To access the jack tools, pull up on the vinyl loop to fold the passenger's side rear bench seat cushion up. Remove the jack tools from the floor underneath of the rear passenger's bench seat.


You do not need to fully fold the rear passenger's bench seat backrest down, so keep the backrest in the fully locked and upright position.

, Do not loosen the lug nuts any more than one turn until the Jeep is up off the ground.

, Insert the jack into the notch of the jacking location you'll be using (usually indicated by a notch on the underside of the Jeep), and make sure it is fully engaged.

,


Do not remove the jack tool or the jack until you're sure your Jeep is fully back on the ground.

,, Again, maximum effort should be used in order to ensure that the lug nuts are fully tightened onto the spare wheel.

, You're almost done now! With the Jeep lowered back onto the ground, unblock the wheel you blocked in the first few steps, and open the rear cargo hatch. Place the jack back into the spare wheel and tire location underneath of the rear cargo floor, and store the wheel and tire you removed back into the spare wheel and tire location. Secure the wheel and tire by using the ""J"" hook and wing nut you removed in the first few steps. Replace the carpeted rear cargo cover.

, Store both spare tire tools in their original locations underneath of the rear passenger bench seat cushion, and fold the rear passenger bench seat cushion back into its original, flat position.

, You should have the lug nut tightness checked by your Jeep dealership's service department, or by an authorized service station by a torque wrench in order to ensure that you've tightened the lug nuts on the spare wheel and tire securely. It's also a good idea to replace the tire that you removed as soon as possible. That's it, you're done!

,
Release the bulb.,
Remove the hydrometer from the coolant.

,
Read the freezing or boiling point level on the hydrometer.",How to Check and Add Radiator Fluid," Ideally, you should do so after driving the car a short distance. You want to check the antifreeze or coolant level while the engine is cool or lukewarm, not hot or cold. If you have driven the car a longer distance, let the engine cool for several hours.


Do not leave the engine running when you check the radiator fluid level, and do not ever try to check the radiator fluid level when the engine is hot.;
,, The radiator cap is a pressurized cap near the top of the radiator. Newer cars label the cap; if yours isn't so labeled, check your owner's manual to find it.

, The radiator and overflow caps absorb engine heat from the coolant; using a rag protects you from being scalded.


Place your pointer finger and middle finger from one hand together and press down on the cap while simultaneously turning the cap off with your other hand. This will prevent a coolant burst in the event that the system is still pressurized.

, The coolant level should be near the top. If there is any ""Full"" marking etched into the radiator metal, that is the level to where your coolant should be.

, Besides the radiator tank, most modern cars have an overflow tank for the radiator fluid to expand into when it gets hot. You should normally find little fluid in here, if any. If your coolant level is low in the radiator and nearly full in the overflow tank long after the car has been driven, take the car in for servicing at once.

, Over time, the ability of your radiator fluid to absorb and dissipate heat declines. You test the freezing and boiling points with an antifreeze hydrometer. See the directions under ""Checking the Coolant Protection Level.""

, Add the fluid to the overflow tank if your car has one; otherwise, add it to the radiator. (You may want to use a funnel to prevent spillage.) Under most driving conditions, antifreeze should be mixed with distilled water at a one to one ratio, or half antifreeze and half distilled water. In more severe climates, you can go as high as 70 percent antifreeze to 30 percent water, but no higher.


Do not add fluid while the engine is still warm.

, This forces air out of the hydrometer.

,, This draws coolant into the hydrometer, so it floats either the needle or the plastic balls inside the hydrometer.

,, If your hydrometer uses a needle, the needle should point to either a specific temperature or temperature range. If it uses a series of plastic balls, the number of balls that can float indicates how well your antifreeze protects the engine from freeze-up or boil over. If the level is insufficient, you will need either to add coolant or replace it.


You should test the coolant protection level in the spring and fall, and more often if you drive the car under extreme conditions.

, Put on gloves if desired.

, Some models have a circular jack pad behind either of the front two tires attached to the chassis. Otherwise, find a solid member of the chassis to apply the jack. On an M3, there is a cross member running from left to right behind the front wheels that is a good place to apply the stand DO NOT jack up your car by applying the jack to a part of the suspension.

, Apply the stand to a solid part of the chassis, then slowly release the jack allowing the car to rest on the stand. Repeat for the other side.

, It will most likely be a 17 mm nut. Place the oil pan beneath the plug. Use a socket wrench to remove the plug and washer. It can help to apply inward pressure on the plug when removing it to avoid spilling hot oil.

, Some people remove the jack stands and lower the car to ensure all of the oil drains as the car is leveled.

, Clean the oil plug and place the new washer that came with the filter on it. Getting back under the car, replace the plug. Do not over tighten. It should be torqued to about 18 feet (5.5 m)-lb. Remove the oil pan and lower the car, removing the jack stands.

, On these cars the filter is under the hood, making it easy to change. Usually it requires a 13-mm socket wrench, but double check to make sure this is the right size. As with any nut, you want to avoid stripping it.

, Replace with your new filter. Apply new, clean oil to the new o-ring before replacing that as well. Torque to around 16 feet (4.9 m)-lb.

, Check with your dealer to see how much oil your car requires depending on the size of the engine. Replace the cap, remove any tools, and start the car. After a few minutes check underneath to ensure that there are no leaks and turn the car off. Check the oil level on the dipstick. It should be between the two notches. If it is too low, add a small amount, run the car again, and shut it off to check the oil level until it is right.

, Do not dump the oil.

It's typically colored red or green to distinguish it from motor oil and other fluids in the vehicle. On most vehicles, you can check the level with a dipstick, while the engine is running.


Look for the transmission fluid dipstick, which is usually red-handled. It should be labeled clearly and easy to access on most cars, close to the oil dipstick. Dipsticks list a hot and cold reading. If your engine has not been run in about an hour and you do not live in an extremely hot climate refer to the Cold Reading for proper levels.
If your levels are low, but the fluid looks clean, you might just top off the system. If the fluid looks discolored or sludgy, you need to change it. If you're at the mileage marker that requires you to change your transmission fluid, you might just elect to change it anyway, even if the fluid looks good.;
, Make sure you've got enough room to squeeze under the vehicle and that the jacks are supported securely.









Always park on a flat, even surface when you're working under the car and use support stands, chucks, or other acceptable bracing to ensure safety should a jack fail or the vehicle attempt to roll off ramps.

, The pan will be attached to the bottom of the transmission with six to eight bolts, so you'll have to crawl underneath the vehicle to locate it. For front-wheel drive vehicles, the transmission is typically situated left-to-right under the engine bay. For rear-wheeled vehicles, the transmission typically hangs under the center console area, facing front to rear.


Examine the pan. In most vehicles, you'll be able to drain the transmission fluid by removing a drain plug in the center of pan and letting the fluid drain out into a receptacle. On some vehicles, however, you might have to remove the transmission pan entirely. The fluid pan will have multiple smaller bolts around the border to hold the pan to the transmission, which you can unscrew and pull the pan free.
If you want to inspect the fluid filter, gaskets, or any other components, you may want to remove the pan anyway to examine the assembly more thoroughly.

, To catch the falling transmission fluid, you'll need a pan under the drain bolt big enough to catch it. Inexpensive plastic receptacles are available at most auto shops.


If your transmission lacks a drain plug, draining the fluid is potentially a very messy operation. Because the fluid will drain around the pan (rather than through a drain plug hole), you will need a collection pan at least as wide as the transmission pan itself if you don’t want to make a mess.

, To drain the fluid, you'll either unscrew the drain bolt or remove the pan and the fluid will start draining immediately. It's likely that you'll get some fluid on your hands (it's almost impossible to avoid this), but you can make sure that you keep your face and chest out of the way to minimize the spillage. Place the receptacle under it, unscrew the plug, and pull it away and free quickly to get out of the way.









If the transmission pan has a drain plug, remove the plug to drain the fluid into a collection pan. Use a pan that can contain up to ten quarts of transmission fluid, although that much probably will not drain out.
If you need to remove the entire transmission fluid pan, unscrew the two upper-most bolts halfway, then unscrew the other bolts all the way. As soon as the last bolt is completely unscrewed, the pan may drop a bit and fluid will begin draining. You may also have to pull it loose using some force.

, Most automatic transmission pans have a magnet inside to collect metal shavings that have been produced by worn moving parts. Remove these shavings along with the remaining fluid in the pan. Metal shavings are normal and represent the typical wear and tear of the gears. Any large or odd-shaped chunks however are not normal. Keep these pieces and seek the advice of a certified mechanic to ensure the transmission is not in need of immediate attention.


About 50 percent of the fluid will remain in the transmission when you drain it. To remove all the fluid, including the fluid in the torque converter, you must flush the transmission completely, a process that is usually part of a more comprehensive maintenance routine.

, While you're changing the fluid, it's a good idea to inspect and evaluate the status of the filter and gaskets and replace them if necessary. They won't need to be replaced every time, but cracked or leaky filters and gaskets need to be removed and replaced with identical parts, which you can purchase at an auto supply store. To find out which replacements you'll need for your model, visit the store and talk to a technician.


If you do this, or if you elect not to, replace the plug and the pan assembly, tightening with a socket or torque wrench. Don't over tighten the bolts.

, Once the pan is back on the vehicle, you can take the car down off the jack stands and replace the transmission fluid with the appropriate variety.There are different kinds of transmission fluid, so you want to make sure to use the kind recommended by the car manufacturer. Check your owner’s manual to add the correct variety of fluid.









On most vehicles, you'll add the transmission fluid through the port from which you removed the dip stick. The new fluid goes directly into this spout, in most cases. You will need to use a funnel. Pour in a little less fluid than drained out so as not to overfill. You can find out the proper amounts in your owner's manual.

, Check the fluid level. If the level is low, add more fluid. Repeat until the transmission fluid is at the right level. Avoid overfilling. Some transmissions require the fluid be checked in neutral and others in park. The wrong amount of fluid will be added if not in correct position. The dip stick and owners manual will indicate correct position.

, Transmission fluid is harmful for the environment, and it's important that you avoid draining or dumping transmission fluids into the environment. Always wear gloves and wash your skin of any residue immediately after completing the change of fluids.


Most auto parts stores and body shops will have fluid recycling programs that allow you to drop off your motor oils, transmission fluids, and other vehicle fluids that you collect when maintaining your vehicle. Find a drop-off site in your area.

;
, There's usually a lever on the inside of your car that pops the hood, usually near the left hand side of the cockpit. Consult your owner's manual if you are unable to find it.








, On many newer cars, the transmission fluid pipe will be labeled; if not, consult your owner's manual for its location.









On a rear-wheel drive vehicle, the dipstick is usually in the rear of the engine, above the valve cover.
On a vehicle with front-wheel drive, the dipstick is usually in the front of the engine and is connected to the transaxle, sticking straight up out of the transmission., On most cars, the car must idling in park with the parking brake on and the transmission hot. Wipe the dipstick on a clean rag or paper towel, reinsert it and pull it out again to check the transmission fluid level. The fluid level should be between two marks labeled either ""Full"" and ""Add"" or ""Hot"" and ""Cold.""









Usually, you should not have to add transmission fluid. If the level is down significantly below the ""Add"" or ""Cold"" line, you probably have a system leak and should take the car to your mechanic to have your car inspected for leaks by a technician.

, Good automatic transmission fluid is usually red (although sometimes pink or light brown), without bubbles or odor. If any of the following conditions are true, take your car in for servicing.









If the transmission fluid is a discolored brown or smells burnt, the fluid has been overheated and it can no longer protect the transmission as designed. The fluid can be tested further by putting some on a clean paper towel and waiting 30 seconds to see if it spreads. If it does not, the transmission should be serviced, or the transmission itself will suffer serious damage.
If the transmission fluid looks milky brown, it has been contaminated by coolant from the radiator through a leak in the automatic transmission fluid cooler. Take the car to your mechanic at once.
If the transmission fluid is either foamy or bubbly, there may be too much fluid in the transmission or the wrong transmission fluid has been used.

, Add the fluid a little at a time, rechecking the level periodically, until it is at the correct level.









If you've drained the care completely, you will probably need to add between three and four quarts of transmission fluid.Otherwise, check the dipstick regularly to avoid overfilling the fluid pan.

, This process allows the newly added transmission fluid to circulate and properly coat each gear, lubricating it. Start with the engine running and the car in park, if possible with the wheels off the ground. Go through First all the way to Third, including Drive, Overdrive, and Reverse gears. When finished, place the vehicle in park and let it idle to warm the fluid.








, Inspect the dipstick, as transmission fluid may have lowered from being circulated through the clutch packs, purging any air from the system. Add fluid as needed to bring to the correct level.








, Depending on whether you're just giving your transmission fluid a top-up or you're replacing the entire pan with new transmission fluid, you may need to add extra fluid at this point.









If you're simply topping up, you may need to only add only a quart of fluid, or even less.
If you've drained the fluid from the pan, removed the pan and replaced the filter, you may need to add anywhere from 4 to 12 quarts, depending on the make and model.

, Your car's transmission fluid is now properly set and your car should be humming along.

The oil sump plate may have a drain plug in the center.
From 1973 onwards, VW left the drain plug out to make sure that the sump plate and screen were removed for cleaning with each oil change. You can fit an original plate with a drain plug from an older beetle model.It is o.k. to clean then the sump plate after every 2nd oil change. Modern motor oils last longer.

,


If the oil sump plate has a center drain plug, unscrew it and let the oil drain into the pan.
If the oil sump plate doesn't have the center drain plug, loosen (but do not remove) the small nuts around the perimeter of the sump plate.

Once most of the nuts are loosened the oil will start to drain from around the sump plate.
Once the oil has completely drained, remove the nuts from around the perimeter of the oil screen sump plate.



,,


Make sure that none of the old gasket remains stuck to the sealing surfaces. Remove with a scraper if necessary.
Clean up the sealing surfaces on the bottom of the engine case with a rag. Clean the sealing surfaces thoroughly to assure the new gaskets will keep your oil in where it belongs.

,


Place the oil screen and gasket into the engine where it goes, then put the other gasket on.
Put the sump plate over the screen and start the nuts (with new crush washers on each one) and the center drain plug (where applicable). Some experts recommend replacing the stock oil plug with a magnetic oil plug. The magnet will pick up metal particles preventing them from circulation throughout the oil system.
DON'T use gasket-goo or other sealants.

Check the oil level every few thousand miles.",How to Change the Oil in a Volkswagen (VW) CC," This is important if the car has not been driven for 10,000 miles before the last oil change. This can be told by the color of the oil. Oil that is black requires an oil change immediately, regardless of the amount of miles driven after the last oil change.
, You want to drive the car for a little bit so that the oil can get warm and is loosened, so that all of the oil will fall out of the oil bay underneath the car. If the oil is not warm enough, some oil will be left over due to the high viscosity of cold oil.

Be careful not to drive the car so much that the oil will become hot and will burn you during the draining process. A good rule of thumb is to just drive the car around the block.

,

The process of an oil change does require some physical work, and having a place that has a comfortable temperature helps.
If the car is parked on an incline, it will not allow the oil to reach the drain point due to the effects of gravity.

, If using four, place on jack underneath each of the jack points. These points should be located right behind the side skirts of the car. They will be isolated breaks in the metal lining behind the skirts., If using two jacks, be careful not to jack the car up so high as to add a considerable incline to the car., The hood release will be on the left side of the foot well in the car. To release the hood, pull the large plastic handle toward you. Then, walk to the front of the car and pull up on the hood by pulling up in the corner in the headlights. Then, walk to the front of the car, reach inside, and pull the latch that will release the hood. The hood will stay open by itself due to hydraulic pistons, and does not require a separate support., To do this, gently, and firmly, pull up toward you on the engine cover by the bottom two corners first, and then by the top two corners., This forces the pressure inside of the engine to be equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure. The oil filter will be located next to the lower lefthand corner of the engine. This will require some force and may require some thick gloves to increase the friction between your hands and the oil filter.

If this is too difficult, the oil filter wrench can be used, and will make the removal process much easier. After removal, it can be thrown out. The old oil filter is not going to be needed anymore and it is important that oil filters are not reused, so the old oil filter may be thrown away in the garbage.

, Line the floor with garbage bags, locate the oil drain bay, and put the oil pan slightly behind where the oil drain hole is located. The oil will drain in an arch and will not go straight down. Place the spotlight in a way so that it shines its' light onto the oil drain bay so that a clear visual can be attained., Unscrew the screw until it can be unscrewed by hand. This is done by turning the screw counter-clockwise. The oil will begin rushing out of the bay in an overreaching arch. The oil pan should be positioned so that the arch can fall inside the pan and part of the pan should still be directly underneath the drain hole. During the draining process, find the new oil filter and open it., Tighten it by hand. Then, tighten it with the ratchet being careful not to strip the screw by overtightening it. Leave the oil pan in place and leave the car jacked in the air., The cap is located on the left side of the engine and has a picture of an oil pump. Stick the cone, or the top of an old oil bottle to avoid spilling the new oil. Open the new bottle of motor oil and line the grooves of the new oil filter (where the oil filter screws into the engine) with a thin layer of oil. Slowly pour about 4 quarts into the engine., Once the oil appears on the dipstick, slowly add more oil until the oil level is in the middle of the safe area in the dipstick. If the oil level is too high, then the excess oil must be drained from underneath the car. Screw the oil fill cap back on after the desired level is reached., Afterwards, turn the engine off and check the oil level on the dipstick, making sure that it is in the middle of the safe area.

If it is less than the safe area, unscrew the oil fill cap, slowly add small amounts of oil until the dipstick shows that the oil is in the safe area. Then screw the oil fill cap back on and turn the car on for about another minute, check the dipstick, and repeat the process if needed.
If the oil level will suffice, make sure that everything that does not belong underneath the hood is removed, the dipstick is put back in place, the oil fill cap is screwed on tightly, the oil filter is screwed on tightly, and the close the hood by lowering the hood until it is about an inch away from the latch, and drop the hood. Gravity will cause the hood to latch itself back in place.

, Remove the oil pan, trash-bags, and spotlight, and dispose of the oil, responsibly, and store the oil pan and the spotlight. The trash bags can be thrown away. Then, lower the car and release the parking break. The car may roll forward, slightly, which is normal after being jacked in the air. The old oil filter, and gloves can be thrown away; place the funnel in storage., If the oil level is low, slowly add a bit more oil. After that, the oil level should remain constant until the next oil change.

If the car is losing oil, for some reason, there may be a leak in the car. To check for a leak, place white paper towels underneath the engine bay, on the garage floor, and let it sit overnight. If the paper towels have anything on them, besides water, there may be a leak. If the color is brown, it is oil. Any other color may indicate a leak elsewhere.

,

Also, check the color of the oil by wiping the dipstick off with a paper towel. If the oil is a light brown, then the motor oil is in good condition. If the oil is dark brown or black, the oil must be changed soon.
Finally, if the oil glistens in the light, like there is some type of metal in the oil, then there is some friction in the engine and the engine is in danger of breaking. Immediately visit your local Volkswagen dealership so that they can take a closer look at the engine. Oil is one of the many diagnostic tools used to catch early engine problems, and will show engine problems before the ""check engine"" light turns on.

Locate the gas meter.,
Find the main valve.On the gas meter, there are two pipes.,
Turn the valve off.,
Turn the gas line off.Make sure the gas line's valve is also turned to the off position.

,
Remove any fittings or additional piping on the gas line.,
Use steel wool to clean the pipes.,
Wrap Teflon tape around the thread of the cap five times.,
Put the threaded cap on gas line.,
Turn the main gas back on.,
Turn the gas line on.,
Check for leaks.,
Relight pilot lights.",How to Cap a Gas Line," The gas meter is either near the garage or at the front of your house. It will either be under your house, in a cabinet, part of a multiple meter, or underground. The main gas valve is located at the gas meter. , One comes into meter from the gas supplier, and the other goes from the meter into your house. The main valve is located on the pipe that comes in from the gas supplier. The main valve looks like a thick rectangular metal tab with a hole. The valve is parallel to the line when it is on and perpendicular when it is off.


On a multiple meter the valve is usually located at the top of a shared pipe. Each unit has an individual shut off valve. Make sure you know which meter is yours so you don’t accidentally shut off someone else’s gas supply.
Check with your landlord to make sure the meter goes to your unit.

, Use a crescent wrench to turn it 90 degrees. There will be another metal rectangular tab that is fixed, which runs perpendicular to the gas line. When the gas is turned off, the holes on both of the tabs will line up.

,, Use a double wrench technique to loosen or remove the the fittings or piping so you don’t destroy any other threaded fittings under the valve.A double wrench technique means holding the valve with one crescent wrench while loosening the fitting with another crescent wrench.
If you are unable to use or don't have crescent wrenches, then use pipe wrenches instead.

, Brush the threading with the steel wool until it is clean. Make sure to clean any wool fibers left on the pipe.

, Hold the tape down tight with your thumb on the first wrap. Then, overlap the tape with each wrapping until is covered. Make sure you wrap tape clockwise around the plug so it won’t unravel as you thread it. Use Yellow Teflon Tape which is rated for gas.
You can also use Teflon pipe dope. Apply the dope evenly on the threads on the gas line. Do not use the dope and tape together.
Use the appropriate cap. If the pipe is brass, use a brass cap. If it is black iron, use a black iron cap.

, Tighten the cap with your fingers. Once it is tight enough to stay on, use the double-wrench technique to fully tighten the cap.Do not tighten the cap too much. In fact, tightening the cap too much could crack the cap and cause a gas leak.

, Use your crescent wrench to turn the metal tab back to the on position. The metal tab should now run parallel to the incoming line from the gas supplier.

, Once the gas is turned on, go back to the line and turn its valve on as well. If you do not turn the gas line on, then you will not be able to test for any possible leaking.

, Put a 50/50 mixture of dish soap and water into a spray bottle and shake it. Spray the mixture onto the gas cap. If you do not see any bubbles, then the cap is installed correctly. However, if you see bubbles appear around the cap that means the gas is leaking. Repeat the steps until there is no leak.


Besides looking for bubbles, listen for gas escaping. It will sound like hissing.

, You may need to relight the pilot light on your water heater and on other appliances since you turned off the gas. "

Some vehicles require only four or five quarts of coolant, while others may require as much as fourteen. You can find the information you need in the vehicle’s owner’s manual.Make sure to purchase the coolant before you begin the project, as you will not be able to drive the car until you refill the drained radiator.
You can ask the clerks at your local auto parts store to look up the capacity and type of coolant you need if you do not have the owner’s manual.;
, The draining of your radiator fluid will likely require jacking the car up, so it’s imperative that you find a level surface to park the car on before you get started. Try to use concrete or blacktop, as gravel or dirt driveways may not provide adequate support for the jack or jack stands once the car is lifted off of its wheels.This project can be completed inside a garage if you have one available to you.
Never jack a car up on grass, as jacks and jack stands can sink while you’re under the vehicle.

, Many cars operate at well over 200 degrees Fahrenheit and the heat can compound under the hood. Your radiator is designed to dissipate that heat by pumping coolant throughout the engine and into the radiator, where wind and the fan can cool it. Because of this, the fluid inside your radiator is extremely hot. This heat can pressurize the fluid in the radiator, causing it to expel extremely hot steam or coolant that can burn you.Wait until the radiator is cool enough to touch before opening any caps or valves.
Depending on how long ago the car was running, you may need to wait a few hours before it’s cool enough.

, While you will not be working on the electrical system of the car, disconnecting the battery is an important first step to any automotive maintenance or repair project. By disconnecting the battery, you ensure that the car cannot be started while you’re replacing the coolant.Disconnect the battery by loosening the bolt on the negative terminal of the battery and removing the cable from the terminal.
Make sure the hood is propped up safely, either by hydraulic pistons or a sturdy hood prop.

, Depending on the vehicle, you may have enough room to slide a bucket beneath the radiator to catch the draining coolant, but if there isn’t sufficient space, you will need to jack the car up to a height that permits it. Use jack stands to support the car after you have lifted it up. Do not leave the vehicle’s weight supported by the jack itself as you work.Make sure to jack the car up from appropriate jack points to ensure you do not damage the frame or body of the vehicle.
Once you have the vehicle lifted up, use jack stands to take the weight off of the jack and support the vehicle.
You can also use wheel ramps to lift the car, if you have them.

, Your radiator is located at the front of the engine bay, just behind the grill of the car. There will likely be one or two fans mounted on the front facing side of the radiator, with plastic or metal end tanks on either side of the aluminum body. The drain valve on your radiator is usually located on the driver’s side, near the bottom, on one of the end tanks.Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, there may be a plug in the drain valve called a “drain cock.”
If you have difficulty locating the drain valve or cock, check in your owner’s manual.

, Make sure you have a bucket that is large enough to hold all of the fluid that will be drained from the radiator, and place it beneath the drain valve. Open the drain valve or remove the drain cock and allow the coolant to drain into the bucket.Be careful, even if the radiator is only warm to the touch, the coolant pouring out may still be quite hot.
Ensure you do not allow the coolant to drain onto the ground or into a drain. Coolant must be disposed of properly in order to protect the environment and adhere to the law.

, Once the radiator is drained, close the valve or replace the drain cock. Then open the radiator cap or the radiator pressure cap (depending on the vehicle). You can locate the cap by checking in the owner’s manual, or simply follow the piping that leads from the radiator to the engine. If there is a cap along the line, use that, or it may lead to a coolant reservoir with a cap on top. Once you locate the appropriate cap, open it and look inside; the level of fluid should be quite low after draining the radiator.Make sure to close the drain valve tightly so fluid will not leak out when you pour more in.
The coolant pressure cap will often be marked with warnings like, “Do not open when engine is hot.”

, If you can hear coolant boiling despite the car’s temperature gauge indicating a normal temperature or if you notice bubbling coolant leaking from beneath the radiator cap, you will likely need to replace it. Doing so will require the purchase of the appropriate radiator cap from your local auto parts store. Make sure to provide them with the make, model and year of your vehicle as well as the engine size so you can be sure you receive the right cap.To install a new radiator cap, simply screw the replacement cap on in place of the old cap once you’ve removed it.
A faulty radiator cap can inhibit your vehicle’s ability to regulate its operating temperature, resulting in overheating and damage.

, Use a jug to pour water into the opening for the radiator pressure cap or into the coolant reservoir. Once filled, close the cap and start the engine. Turn the heat on to full inside the cabin of the vehicle and allow it to run for about ten minutes, this will cycle the water through the coolant system to help you get the last of the old coolant drained.Keep an eye on the temperature gauge of your vehicle while it’s running. If the hand approaches the red portion of the gauge, shut the car off immediately. Do not allow it to reach the red, as that indicates overheating.
If your vehicle has an engine temperature warning light instead of a gauge, shut the vehicle off immediately if the light turns on.

, You will need to transport the drained coolant to an authorized coolant disposal location. Many auto part stores and county recycling centers/waste disposal centers will allow you to drop off used coolant free of charge, but depending on your location you may need to pay for disposal service. Pour the bucket you used to drain the coolant into old jugs or something else that can be sealed to avoid spilling it along the way.Old coolant jugs work well to store used coolant.
Do not pour the used coolant into old oil containers, as mixing the two fluids may prevent some locations from taking the waste coolant.

, If your vehicle has been overheating or failing to reach appropriate operating temperature, it may be because you need to replace the thermostat. While the thermostat may be located in different places depending on the make and model of your vehicle, it can usually be found where the top most radiator hose meets the engine.You can search for the location of your specific vehicle’s thermostat online or ask the clerk at your auto parts store to help by pointing out where it should be.
Some vehicles come with maintenance booklets that go along with the owner’s manual. The location of the thermostat should be listed in your maintenance booklet.

, The line will likely be attached to a nozzle and held in place using a hose clamp. Some hose clamps require the use of a flat or phillips head screwdriver to loosen, while others need to be squeezed with pliers. Determine the right way to loosen the hose clamp, then do so and remove the hose from the metal nozzle.Make sure there is a bucket under the hose to catch any remaining coolant that may drain out of the hose when you disconnect it.
Leave the radiator line connected on the radiator end.

, The nozzle the hose used to be connected to should have two bolts (but possibly as many as four) securing it to the engine. Using a hand or socket wrench, remove these bolts and attempt to remove the housing (nozzle). If it doesn’t come off easily, do not use a tool to pry against it, as you can damage the parts and make it impossible to re-seal the coolant system.If it won’t budge, tap on it with a piece of wood or rubber mallet until the rubber gasket holding it in place gives way.
Remove the housing (nozzle) and set it aside.

, The thermostat housing is sealed using a gasket that will have to be replaced. Before the new gasket can be put in place, the old damaged gasket must be scraped off both the housing and where it mounts to the engine. You can use a scraper or razor blade to scrape off the remaining gasket material.All of the material must be removed in order for the new gasket to seal properly.
Be very careful not to damage the housing. The housing must sit securely on the engine in order to ensure it seals.

, To remove the thermostat, simply lift it out of the now open thermostat housing. Place the new thermostat in the housing in the exact same way you found the old one. Once the new thermostat is in the housing, place the new gasket on the housing taking care to align the holes for the bolts.You can purchase the appropriate gasket at your local auto parts store.
Make sure to provide your vehicle’s make, model, year and engine size when purchasing the gasket to ensure you receive the correct one.

, With the gasket in place, put the nozzle back over the thermostat and secure it with the bolts you removed previously. You can then reattach the hose and secure it in place with the hose clamp.Make sure everything is tight, otherwise your coolant system could leak.
You may need to replace the hose clamp if it was ruined while you removed it. You can purchase hose clamps at more hardware or auto parts stores.

, Shut the vehicle off and allow it to cool again before attempting to progress further. Although you only let it run for ten minutes or so, it may take quite a bit longer than that for it to cool enough for you to begin working. If the car’s temperature gauge was beginning to rise toward the red, it will likely take even longer.Wait until the radiator is once again cool enough to touch before moving forward.
If the vehicle was approaching overheating, you may need to wait an hour or longer.

, Follow the same steps you used to drain the old coolant from the radiator to drain the water you added. This water will flush out the remaining old coolant as you drain it, leaving your coolant system ready for you to fill it with a new coolant mixture.You will need to dispose of this waste water in the same way as the coolant, so you should transfer it into sealable containers.
Make sure to securely close the drain valve after draining the water before adding any coolant to the vehicle.

, Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to ensure you fill the vehicle with the correct coolant. Most vehicles require a 50/50 mixture of coolant and water, so you can either mix it yourself or purchase pre-mixed coolant and water from your local retailer. Pour the coolant into the same open cap you previously used to fill the radiator with water. Some systems require you to pour the fluid in slowly, as it gradually displaces the fluid out of the reservoir and into the coolant lines, so be patient to avoid overflowing.Make sure to pour in the amount of coolant/water mixture your owner’s manual indicates is correct for your vehicle’s engine.
Check below the car for any leaks, particularly near the drain valve. If the drain valve is leaking, tighten it to stop the leak, as it will get worse under pressure. If you spot leaks elsewhere, you will likely need to take your vehicle in for professional repairs.
When filled, the coolant/water mix should reach the “max” line on the reservoir if your vehicle has one.

, Run the engine for another ten minutes with the heater in the cabin of the vehicle on high. Watch the temperature gauge as the engine cycles the water/coolant mixture throughout the coolant system. The gauge is likely to go up a bit before returning to normal, which should be indicated in blue or as the “middle” of the gauge.If the temperature begins to climb toward overheating, turn off the vehicle and check the coolant levels to make sure it is filled.
After about ten minutes, shut the vehicle off. If the temperature read normal, the coolant change is complete.
Lower the vehicle off of the jack stands and clean up the area, paying special attention not to spill any waste coolant or water.

, After a few days of regular driving, check the coolant levels again. The fluid levels may have lowered as the coolant/water mixture filled all of the coolant lines and the radiator, so add fluids if you notice the level is low in the coolant reservoir. There are usually lines that indicate minimum and maximum coolant levels. Fill the reservoir until it reaches the “max” line if it has fallen below it.If the coolant levels are seriously low, you likely have a leak and should bring your vehicle to a professional service location to be looked at.
If you accidentally overfill the reservoir, you can drain some fluid in the same manner as you have before, but be very careful, as it can be difficult to stop the radiator from draining once you open the valve.

Ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to help you find the correct fluid to use.Be sure to provide the year, make and model of your vehicle to get the right fluid.
Your vehicle’s owner’s manual should also indicate the correct type of differential fluid to use.;
, Be sure the vehicle is parked on a level surface that is strong enough to support the weight of the vehicle centralized beneath the jack. Black top or concrete are the optimal surfaces. Slide the jack beneath the vehicle at one of its designated jack points and use the handle to jack the vehicle up off the ground.If you are unsure of where the designated jack points are for the rear of your vehicle, refer to the owner’s manual for guidance.
Never jack up a vehicle on grass, gravel or dirt.

, Never work beneath a vehicle that is supported only by a jack. Once the vehicle is jacked up to a sufficient height, slide jack stands under the vehicle at another designated jack point.Jacks may lower the vehicle unexpectedly while you’re beneath it.
Lower the vehicle onto the jack stands slowly to ensure they are positioned correctly.

, The rear differential is located between the two rear wheels of the vehicle. While it is not always located directly in the center of the vehicle, it is usually close to the middle. The differential may resemble a basketball or a pumpkin, prompting some to refer to it as “the pumpkin” of the vehicle.Along the bottom of the differential there is a bolt that can be removed to drain the fluid.
The drain bolt will resemble the one you might remove from an oil pan to drain the oil from the engine.

, Make sure you have a sealable container to catch the old differential fluid as you drain it from the vehicle. Place the container beneath the drain bolt so the fluid will pour into the container once you remove it.Used differential fluid will need to be brought to a certified recycling location.
Do not mix old differential fluid with oil or gasoline.

, Use a hand or socket wrench of the appropriate size to turn the drain bolt counter-clockwise to loosen it. Once the bolt is hand loose, use your hand to unscrew it while applying pressure inward to keep it from leaking as you loosen the plug. Once it is completely unthreaded, pull the plug away and let the fluid pour out.You may want to wear gloves to avoid getting old differential fluid on your hands.
Make sure the vehicle is cool when doing this otherwise the fluid may burn you.

, It may take a few minutes for the differential fluid to drain out completely. Make sure the container is positioned properly and does not overflow as the fluid drains out.Allow the differential to drain until there is only a slow drip of fluid remaining.
Seal the container once the differential has finished draining for storage and transport to a recycling center.

, Once the differential is empty, use your hand to thread the drain bolt back into place, then use the wrench to tighten it until the differential is once again sealed.Do not overtighten the drain bolt. It only needs to be tight enough to provide a seal.
Be sure to use the correct size wrench to avoid stripping or damaging the head of the bolt.

, With the differential drain bolt in place, locate the fill bolt near the top of the differential. In some vehicles, you will not be able to see it easily, but you should be able to feel it if it is on the top. Many vehicles now place the filler bolt on the back side of the differential for easier access.Use a hand or socket wrench to remove the filler bolt.
Set the bolt aside some place safe so you don’t lose it as you fill the differential.

, Use a hand pump to fill the differential with fluid. You will not be able to pour the fluid directly in because of the angle. Hand pumps come in a number of varieties and will allow you to pump the fluid out of the container from beneath the differential.Open the seal on the top of the differential fluid and insert the inlet hose or tube for the hand pump.
Be careful not to tip the differential fluid over with the pump as you get situated beneath the differential.

, Crank or pump the hand pump to introduce new fluid into the differential. Continue to pump until you reach the maximum capacity listed in the vehicle’s owner’s manual or until you see fluid start to seep out of the filler hole.You can purchase hand pumps at most auto parts stores.
Check the automaker’s website for maximum capacities if you do not have an owner’s manual.

, Once the differential is full of new fluid, replace the filler bolt with your hand, then tighten it using the wrench. Ensure the filler and drain bolts are both secure and wipe them down with a rag so you will be able to identify any leaking in the future.Take the vehicle for a short drive, then check to ensure neither bolt is leaking.
If you spot a leak, tighten the bolts and wipe them down again.

",How to Apply Car Polish,"


Use an orbital buffer for faster results, but keep in mind that it's more difficult to control the amount of finish that your polish removes. It can also create deep scratches if any dirt or debris comes between the buffer pad and the vehicle. If you use an orbital buffer, use it on the slowest setting available to ensure that you don't remove too much paint from your car.
Use a hand-polish technique for greater control. Applying car polish by hand with a soft cloth takes much longer, but gives you greater control over the process. It is also less expensive than an orbital buffer.;
, If there is any dirt or debris on your car, polishing will grind it into the finish. Be sure the car is completely dry before you begin polishing.

, If you're using an orbital buffer, turn it on after you've used the pad to rub some of the polish on the car to prevent splattering.


Apply more pressure at the site of the scratch if you're working only on a scratched section of your car. Gradually reduce pressure as you move away from it. This will help the newly polished area blend in with the rest of your car.
Work slowly and do 1 small section at a time if you're polishing your entire vehicle. Use plenty of polishing paste, and take care to keep your cloth from drying out.

, Finish working on 1 area entirely before moving on to the next, so that the polish does not have a chance to dry on your car's finish before you've rubbed or buffed it away.

Do not apply wax to a car with matte finish.",How to Wax Your Car," Using mild soap and water, thoroughly clean your car in preparation for waxing it. You want your car to be completely clean and completely dry before waxing. Wax has a tougher time adhering to dirt and moisture than it does the spanking clean surface of a clean car.;
, Rubbing and polishing compounds are slight abrasives that actually remove a fine layer of clear coat from your vehicle in order to achieve a smooth layer and even coloring.


Polishing compound is less abrasive than rubbing compound, making it better suited for pre-wax treatment. Use a damp microfiber cloth to rub the polishing compound lightly over the entirety of the car and then another microfiber cloth to remove the compound.

, In very hot weather, the wax dries instantly as soon as you apply it to the car, making buffing quite difficult. This can also make the wax difficult to remove once applied. In colder weather, the wax is hard to move around and apply to the car itself., Mostly for temperature reasons (addressed above), it's best to wax your car indoors so that the rays of the sun don't interfere with the waxing. Sunlight can heat up the car in addition to leaving waxy residue on the car which becomes difficult to remove. If you can, wax in your garage, where the temperature is more or less controlled and the rays don't penetrate. If you don't have a garage, find a spot in the shade of a tree or building to work, pick an overcast day, or work in the cool of morning or evening.

, Ideally, the ones containing genuine carnauba prove to be the best productsalthough they are usually a little more expensive. But there are other kinds of wax that you may also want to know about:


""Cleaner wax"" is generally a little less expensive, but also proves to be harsher. Cleaner waxes often remove clear coat from your car.If you're using this kind of wax on your car, consider removing the polishing step from your pre-wax maintenance.
Spray waxes go on easier, but of course there's a downside: They don't last nearly as long. Tested varieties of spray waxes tended to last only a couple weeks before succumbing to the elements., A silver dollar-sized amount should work fine for each 2' x 2' (60cm x 60cm) section of your car. Just to be sure, check the manufacturer's directions as a reference.


How much wax should you use? Err on the side of less, not more. Applying too much wax is a common mistake. It creates more waste, is harder to remove, and leaves gunky buildup. A thinner layer of wax actually bonds better with the surface of the car.If your car wax didn't come with a foam applicator, try a damp sponge. It's not the greatest applicator, but it'll do the job in a pinch. It should go without saying, but if you decide to use a sponge, don't use it to clean dishes afterward.

, Divide your car up into sections and wax each section at a time, applying more wax as needed. Gentle, overlapping strokes — between 3 and 5 lbs of pressure — will do the job just fine.

, Use a high-speed, dual-action, or random orbital buffer to apply more wax to the car and buff out any imperfections. Set your buffer at a low speed, apply wax to the buffing pad or directly onto the car, and buff the car holding the buffer evenly on the surface of the car. Apply more wax as needed

, After waxing and buffing, wait as long as the wax manufacturers recommend. This may require waxing or buffing in sections, stopping, and then wiping away wax.


Here's a good way that you can tell whether the wax is ready to come off. Make a swipe in the wax with your finger. If it smears, the wax isn't ready to come off yet. If it's clear, you're ready to take the wax off.

, Use one side of the cloth to wipe away any wax on the car in circular motions. When the cloth begins to drag, that's a sign that the cloth has too much buildup. Flip the cloth and continue wiping away the remaining wax for a smooth finish.

, Be sure to wipe off any remaining wax residue. You're done, amigo!

, Of course, you can use regular old mild dish detergent on your car if you prefer, but that won't do much in the way of preserving your beautiful wax finish. Use a wash designed for wax finishes to get the most mileage out of your wax, and then reapply the wax as needed when it wears off.

, Many professionals double-wax for a deep, enduring finish. Start off with a synthetic wax, buffing it up for extra shine. Wipe away, and then finish with another layer of carnauba wax. Polish for the kind of high shine often found at car shows., If after you've removed the wax you're still experiencing streaking, here's one tip to help you out. Fill a spray bottle with distilled water. Add a teaspoon of rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol to the bottle and mix vigorously. Lightly mist the car where the stubborn streaks are appearing and wipe away with a microfiber cloth.

, This is another way of saying that each car is different, and that knowing when to wax again will depend on your eyes and touch, not on what the manufacturer says.


Manufacturers have a financial incentive to overestimate how much you'll need to use your wax product. They'll often err on the side of applying more often, because it means you'll go through product quicker, and ultimately spend more money.
On the other hand, some waxes won't have a long half-life on certain cars and may need to be reapplied with greater frequency.

, Cars with matte finishes should not be waxed.Shine agents are a big no-no for cars with a matte finish.

There are several varieties available, including Detailer’s Pride Clay.Another option is Meguiar’s Smooth Surface Clay Kit, which includes detailing spray (which you would use as a lubricant for the clay), as well as wax and a microfiber cloth.These detailing clays should be available at your local auto parts store.

, You only need a small, flat section the size of your palm, so if you bought a new bar you should cut it in half. Then, seal it in a Ziploc bag and place it in a bucket or bowl of warm water, which will warm up the clay so you can manipulate it more easily. Take the half of the bar and knead it in your hands. You want to form a pancake or patty with the clay., A lubricant is necessary so that your clay will glide over, rather than stick to, the paint. Shake the lubricant, then spray it onto the clay and also onto the paint on your car. Use an ample amount so that your clay won’t smudge onto the car.Clay lubricant should be available at your local auto parts store.

, Hold the clay in your hand so that your fingertips are not covered by the clay -- you want it to be a little lower in your palm. Rub the clay back and forth with a firm pressure, like you would rub a bar of soap over your skin. Keep rubbing the clay over the spray paint until the paint is removed.When your clay becomes covered in contaminants, fold it over and re-knead it to form a clean patty.

, Use a microfiber cloth to wipe the clay residue off the car. Apply a light pressure and rub the cloth over the area where you applied the clay., Claying the car removes previous wax, so it’s important to wax your car to protect from further damage and restore the shine to your clear coat. Apply the wax in a circular motion, using the tool or sponge that comes with the wax, or use a soft rotating buffing tool."
"
Purchase liquid carnauba wax.,
Apply the wax to a sponge.,
Rub the sponge on the spray paint.,
Buff off the wax.",How to Get Spray Paint off a Car3," Products like Butter Wet Carnauba Wax contain carnauba oils that will break down the spray paint. The wax will not damage or scratch your paint or clear coat, but will simply remove the spray paint from the surface of your car. You should be able to find a liquid carnauba wax at your local auto parts store, but if not, you can order it online., Put an ample amount of the liquid wax onto a soft sponge or cloth. Squirt it on or add several dollops to your sponge. Apply more as you go, and don’t be afraid to use a lot of the wax as it is needed to break down the paint., Using firm pressure and circular motions, rub the waxed sponge onto the affected area of your car. Make sure you get all the overspray and any errant dots or drips. Flip your sponge over or get a new one once the surface is covered in spray paint transfer., After removing the spray paint, you’ll want to buff the wax off your car. Use a clean microfiber cloth to do the buffing. Rub the waxed area using small, circular motions."

, If you have a standard transmission, put your vehicle in first or reverse.










, in front of the front and back tires.










, Place the jack under the frame near the tire that you are going to change. Ensure that the jack is in contact with the metal portion of your car's frame











Many cars have molded plastic along the bottom. If you don't place the jack in the right spot, it will crack the plastic when you start lifting. If you're not sure about the right place to put the jack, read your owner's manual.
For most modern uni-body cars, there is a small notch or mark just behind the front wheel wells, or in front of the rear wheel wells where the jack is intended to be placed.
For most trucks or older cars that have a frame, look to place the jack on one of the beams of the frame just behind the front tire or in front of the rear tire.

, The jack should be firmly in place against the underside of the vehicle. Check to make sure that the jack is perpendicular to the ground.










, Don't take them all the way off; just break the resistance. By keeping the wheel on the ground when you first loosen the nuts, you'll make sure that you're turning the nuts instead of the wheel.











Use the wrench that came with your car or a standard cross wrench. Your wrench may have different sizes of openings on different ends. A correctly-sized wrench will slip easily over the nut, but will not rattle.
Try to prepare for any unforeseen tire changes by keeping the exact socket size for your lug nuts as well as a breaker bar handy in the trunk.
It can take quite a lot of force to break your lug nuts free. If all else fails, you can use your body weight or stomp on the wrench (be absolutely certain you are turning it the correct way - counterclockwise). However, using your body weight or stomping means you run the risk of stripping the lug nuts, as it is difficult to maintain full contact.

, You need to lift it high enough to remove the flat tire and replace it with a spare.











As you lift, make sure that the car is stable. If you notice any instability, lower the jack and fix the problem before fully lifting the car.
If you notice the jack lifting at an angle or leaning, lower and reposition it so that it can lift straight up.
It is always a good idea to keep a small jack stand handy in the vehicle as well, in case the jack gives out during the tire change. Using both the small jack and the normal jack will keep you safe in the event of a jack failure.

, Turn them counterclockwise until they are loose. Repeat with all lug nuts, then remove the nuts completely.











Although rare, some vehicles actually have reverse threaded lug nuts. These are usually much older cars from Chrysler and GM.

, Place the flat tire under the vehicle so in the event of a jack failure the vehicle will fall on the old wheel, hopefully preventing injury. If the jack is placed on a flat, solid base, you shouldn't have any problems.











The tire might stick due to rust. You could try hitting the inside half of the tire with a rubber mallet to loosen the tire, or use the spare tire to hit the outside half.

, Take care to align the rim of the spare tire with the wheel bolts, then put on the lug nuts.











Be sure to install the spare tire the correct way and not backwards. The valve stem of a doughnut tire should face outwards, away from the vehicle.
If your vehicle uses acorn-style lug nuts, it is easy to put those on backwards as well. Be sure the tapered part of the nut faces the wheel when tightening it down.

, They should turn easily at first.











Using the wrench, tighten the nuts as much as possible using a star pattern. To ensure the tire is balanced, don't completely tighten the nuts one at a time. Going in a star pattern around the tire, one nut across from another, give each nut a full turn until they are equally tight.
Avoid using so much force that you risk upsetting the jack. You will tighten the lug nuts again once the car is down and there is no risk of it falling.

, Tighten the nuts as much as possible.










, Finish tightening the nuts and replace the hubcap.










, Get an estimate for the cost of repair. Small punctures can usually be repaired for less than $15. If the tire is not repairable, they can dispose of it properly and sell you a replacement

, Before mounting the wheel onto the machine, make sure you have your center caps off (if you have them), and the old wheel weights from the previous balancing off. This is to ensure that you get the most accurate results from the machine.

, After you have done all the previous steps, you can now safely mount your wheel onto the machine. Once it is on, double check to make sure that the wheel is snug tight.

, Once the wheel is on, the machine will want to know the size of the rim. You will have to measure the height of the rim, as well as the width

, Depending on the machine you're using, it may have a feature which allows you to choose what type of vehicle this wheel will be going on so it can put the proper amount of road force when it’s being tested.

, If you don’t do this before closing down the hood, it will ask you if you have done it or not to be a reminder.

, Once you have measure your rims and have chosen the proper type of vehicle, you can simply presses start or close the hood.

, Once the machine has finished testing the road force and balance the wheel, it will tell you how much weight it wants and what side of the wheel.

, Once you have install the wheel weights, you want to rebalance the wheel to make sure you added the proper amount of the wheel weights, and at the proper spot of the rim it has asked.

, After rebalancing your wheel and it says “ok”, you are now done and can take the wheel off the machine. The wheel is now ready to be install on the vehicle.

Understand that the primary function of tread on a tire is to divert water from beneath the tire to improve traction and avoid hydroplaning on wet roads.Tires become unsafe when they're worn, and once the tread is down to 1/16th of an inch (1.6mm), the tire is no longer safe.,
Look at the tread pattern.,
Check the tread by using the ""penny test."",
Use a tread depth indicator or gauge.,
Know the legal requirements.,
Make note of any irregular tread wear.,
Check for any abnormal bulges or ""bubbles"" in the sidewall.,
Replace the tires at least every 6 years.,
Notice a vibration in the steering wheel.,
Check for dry rot.",How to Know when Car Tires Need Replacing,";
, All tires sold in the United States and other countries have what are called ""tread wear bars."" These are small bridges that form between your treads. Look at the tread pattern and you'll see the beginnings of these bars start to form between the treads, or running across the tires. As the tires wear, these bars will become flush (level or even) with the tire's tread. At this point, it's time to replace the tires.

, Take a penny and place it upside down with Lincoln facing you in the center of the tread (at the thickest part of the tire).


If you can see the very top of Lincoln's head or the copper above it, replace the tires immediately.
If Lincoln's hair on the top of his head is partially visible, it is time to go shopping for tires.
If you cannot see the hair on the top of his head (if the coin is inserted enough that the tire tread is at least as deep as Lincoln's forehead), your tires do not need replacing yet.

, You can use a special tread depth indicator or gauge tool to measure your tire's tread. If you don't already own one, the gauge is cheap to purchase from an auto parts dealer and it's easy to use.


You may be able to find a downloadable tread depth gauge by searching online.
Alternatively, it might be easier to pop in to your regular tire place and ask them to check it for you; likely they'll do this for free if you're regular customer.

, Worn tires should be replaced as a matter of common sense to assure safety, but in some jurisdictions, there are also legal requirements to replace worn tires. In many US States, tires are considered to be legally worn out when they have worn down to 1/16"" (1.6mm) of their remaining tread depth.In the UK, the minimum depth of the tread on tires (tyres) is 1.6 millimeters across the central ¾ of the tread around the whole tire (tyre)., This could indicate a wheel misalignment, the need for a tire rotation, or both. Uneven tread wear is a sign that you need to take your car in for servicing.


If uneven tire wear is extreme or if tires wear out much faster than expected, have a competent tire workshop check your suspension and correct it as necessary before replacing tires. Improper alignment or worn suspension parts can dramatically shorten a tire's life.
It is a good idea to rotate your tires from front to rear in pairs. Take both front tires and move them to the rear and vice versa.

, A sidewall bulge indicates that the rigid internal frame of the tire has been damaged and cracked, allowing air pressure to reach the flexible outer layers of the tire. Such damage could be caused by driving through a large pothole or over a curb, or by driving with low tire pressure. Continuing to drive on a tire that has a sidewall bulge is dangerous. The structural integrity of the tire has been significantly reduced, greatly increasing the likelihood of a sudden failure or blowout at highway speeds, which could cause a serious accident. Any tires with sidewall bulges should be replaced immediately, regardless of the tread status.

, If you're not sure, the minimum replacement time that is recommended by the NHTSA is six years regardless of use, with 10 years being the maximum service life for tires. Check your owner's manual for specific recommendations related to your car. And always err on the side of caution if you suspect your vehicle has tires that are over six years of age.

, If your tires are worn unevenly, you may feel a vibration in the steering wheel when you are driving. Your tires probably need to be rebalanced. If that doesn't stop the vibration, more than likely the tire is damaged.


Vibrations may also be caused by tires that are ""cupped,"" meaning they have a cupped or scalloped appearance around the tire. This occurs when tires haven't been rotated regularly.

, If you see little cracks all over your tires, it means that the rubber is breaking down. Tires with dry rot can fall apart, separating from the steel belt causing damage to the exterior of the car.

",How to Buy All Seasonal Tires," These types of tires work reliably in all seasons, but if you are in a climate with heavy snow and ice, snow tires might be better for you.;
, Check out the type of tires that are on your car.


Consider buying the same tires that came with your car, if they are all seasonal. Engineers often match the tire suspension to the rubber when they are putting tires on your car.







, You can find safety reviews in Consumer Reports, or consumer magazines such as Car and Driver or Popular Mechanics.


Check websites belonging to consumer magazines for more updated reports than the printed publications often contain.







, The person or business that does most of your car repairs may be able to recommend an all seasonal tire for your car.

, Look at what Michelin, Goodyear, Bridgestone and other well-known brands have to offer in all seasonal tires.


Compare prices. Unless you are buying tires of an unusual size, most all seasonal tires will cost between $130 and $200 per tire when they are new.






Check the tire tread. Look for something that will provide good traction on all road surfaces and in all weather conditions. Look for an open tread pattern and a narrower tread.






Research the ability of the tire to accelerate and brake. You can ask a tire sales associate about this, or read up on it in safety reviews.







, All tires are rated for their ability to grip the road. You will see a stamp that says A, AA, B or C on the tire. Buy A or AA for the best traction.

, If you put few miles on your car and you find tires that are used but reliable, you can probably save money on your all seasonal tires.

, Find out how many miles can go on the tires before you will need to replace them.

, Talk to your dealer or mechanic about the best tires to buy, and then look for the best deal you can find.


Check discount tire centers. Their prices are often more competitive than car dealers.






Look for tires online. There are wholesale tire retailers online who might have lower prices than the tire stores you visit. Check sites such as Tire Rack and Tire Buyer.

Remove the lug nuts from the first tire you've raised and remove it.,

Place hubcaps back on the wheels by replacing the lug nuts.",How to Rotate Tires," Your car comes with a jack so you can change one tire at a time, but you'll need to have the entire car off the ground to rotate your tires. The easiest and cheapest way to do this is to get a set of jack stands, which run somewhere around $30. DO NOT try to do this with multiple jacks.









If you don't want to buy jack stands, you can use large wood blocks. Do not use cinder blocks because they can break, risking injury to you and damage to your vehicle.;
, Reduce the risk of the vehicle tipping when in the air by working on a flat surface. Engage the parking brake before you start the job, and block the wheels you haven't jacked to keep the car from rolling forward or back while you work.









If your driveway is on an incline, or if you don't have a driveway, this won't take much time and you can to complete this project in the empty corner of a big box-store parking lot.

, While your car is still on the ground, use a flathead screwdriver and remove the hubcaps so the lug nuts are exposed. Then, with the lug wrench, loosen the lug nuts holding the tire to the axle. DO NOT remove the nuts, just loosen them slightly to make removing them easier when the car is in the air.









Upturn one of the hubcaps to use as a bowl. Place all of your lug nuts in this bowl so you don't lose or misplace any.

, Use your jack to raise each corner of the car and then install the jack stand. Consult your owner's manual to determine the proper placement of the jack.









Using four jack stands would be the easiest and quickest way to complete the job, but some people get rightly nervous having the entire weight of the car in the air.If you only have two jack stands, you'll have to raise and lower the car a few times with your jack, since the procedure calls for you to switch the front tires with the back tires.
Either way, planning the pattern of the rotation is a smart idea before starting to remove any tires.

, Directional tires have tread that goes one way, usually with grooves designed to channel water and road-grit outward to improve handling. For this reason, you can't switch driver's-side directional tires to the passenger's side, and vice versa. Non-directional tires all look the same and can be safely switched between the passenger and driver side.









For directional tires, rotating the tires means you'll need to switch the front driver's side tire with the rear driver's side, and the front passenger's side tire with the rear passenger's side tire.
For non-directional tires, the usual rotation pattern is to rotate the front driver's side tire to the rear passenger's side. The front passenger's side gets the rear driver's side tire, and both rear tires move straight up the car. This pattern ensures that you'll get a complete rotation of the tires after two rotations, ensuring the longest possible tire life.

, Roll the tire to the new location. Keep track of the lug nuts by keeping them close to the axle from which they were removed. The threads should be uniform, but generally you'll keep them with their location on the car, not the tire.








, If you've got the entire car off the ground, just move the tires to their new locations, place them on the studs, and hand-tighten the lug nuts.









If you've only got two jack stands, and you've got them both occupied with the back of the car, say, then you'll start by removing both rear tires. Then, you'll need to move the rear driver's side tire to the front driver's side location. Jack that spot up with your jack, remove the tire, install the new tire, hand-tighten the lug nuts, and lower the jack. Then move that front tire to the rear passenger's side, etc. Continue moving around the car, rotating the tires in the proper pattern.

, With your jack, raise each location up off the jack stand until you can safely remove it, then lower the car. Make sure you've tightened each tire on hand-tight before you do this. You should be able to wobble the tire back and forth.








, Most cars have 4 or 5 lug nuts. When the car is lowered completely, tighten the lug nuts with your lug wrench by tightening one nut, plus a quarter-turn, then the nut directly across from it, then back to the nut next to the first, etc.









If you have one, you can now use a torque wrench to finalize tightening lug nuts to spec. For most cars it is somewhere between 80–100 feet (24.4–30.5 m)lbs. For trucks, 90–140 feet (27.4–42.7 m)lbs.

, Check the air pressure in your tires and add some air if necessary.

Tighten the lug nuts with the crowbar to ensure a tight fit.",How to Change a Hubcap1," You're going to be right down by the wheels, so make sure that they can't roll!






;
, Lugnuts are the small, hexagonal screws holding the tire onto the car. This may take some effort if the lug nuts are tight. Once loose, you can unscrew them by hand. If you're really struggling, you can apply pressure to the wrench with your foot to really get them off.









A lug wrench looks like a crowbar with a circular hole in it. It should be in your trunk with the car, but make sure you have one if not. They are also needed to change a tire.

, Lugnuts hold both the wheel and the hubcap on, and you don't want the whole wheel coming off. Take care to put the lug nuts somewhere safe so you do not lose them.









If you have five total lugnuts, take off two that are next to each other and one on the opposite side.

, These are what keep the hubcaps on, not just the lug nuts. Set them aside somewhere safe -- you'll need them.








, You don't need to completely tighten them on, just to hand tightness. Then use the lug wrench to tighten them just a quarter turn more or so. These three will keep the tire in place as you remove the other two washers.








, Without the washers, the hubcap should slide right off.








, There will be a small cut out that needs to fit over the valve of the tire. Line this up, then slide the new hubcap on and tighten on the two nuts. Just tighten them by hand for now -- don't worry about full tightness.








, Tighten them back on by hand so that your tire is back where it started. You can also slip the washers over the section








, Tighten them all by hand at first. Then, working in a circle, tighten them each one quarter-turn at a time until they don't want to move too much. Never tighten one screw completely before moving on to the others -- this can bend or warp the hubcap.

Read the manufacturer and the tire name.,
Look at the service description.,
Find the width and aspect ratio.,
Know the internal construction of the tire.,
Know the rim diameter.,
Find the tire's load index.,
Find the tire's speed rating.,
Find the temperature-resistance rating.,
Identify the Department of Transportation code by finding the numbers that follow the DOT acronym.








,
Find the cold inflation numbers near the inner edge of the tires.",How to Read a Tire," These are printed in large letters toward the outside of the tire. They say the name brand of the company, such as Hankook, or Michelin, or Goodyear.









The tire name may be letters only or a combination of numbers and letters, such as Goodyear's Eagle F1 GS-D3, the Hankook Ventus R-S2 Z212, or the Kumho Ecsta MX.;
, The service description, although it doesn't appear on every tire, is usually right after the manufacturer name. It comes in either a ""P,"" ""LT,"" ""ST,"" or ""T.""









""P"" stands for passenger car.
""LT"" stands for light truck.
""ST"" stands for special trailer.
""T"" stands for temporary, and is borne by spare tires.
""BP"" stands for cosmetically blemished passenger.

, This is a series of numbers right after the service description. The series of numerals and letters will have a forward slash dividing them and have the general form of www/aaCrr.









The first series of three numbers tells you the width of the tire tread in millimeters. Width tread may range from 155 to 315.
The two numbers after the slash show the aspect ratio of the tire. This is the tread-width percentage that is equal to the sidewall's height. The average ranges from 55 to 75 percent in most passenger vehicles.

, Most likely an ""R,"" this mark usually comes right after the aspect ratio. ""R"" stands for radial construction, an industry standard for passenger cars. Some trucks may have a ""B"" instead, which stands for bias-ply, but which has largely been discontinued due to poor handling issues.







, Usually immediately after the internal construction, it's the rim size for which the tie was fitted. So, for example, if you have 22 inch (55.9 cm) rims, you'll have a tire whose rim diameter is also 22 inches (55.9 cm).









The letters in the position of SC or C signify the speed rating of the tire (pre-1991) or the construction of the tire. An ""R"" means the tire is of radial construction. If there is an ""HR,"" this is a high-speed radial tire.

, This number is extremely important, as the load index is the tire size's relative load carrying capabilities. The higher the load index number, the larger load carrying capacity.









The index is not a hard number; it's just a symbol of sorts. To find out how many pounds a tire can carry, consult a Load-Carrying Capacity Per Tire chart.
To find out how much your entire car can carry without putting undue strain on your tires, multiply the number you found in the Load-Carrying Capacity Per Tire chart by four. You have four tires, after all.
Never replace your tires with ones that have a lower load index than the original tires. You always want to have tires with the same, or higher load index. So, if you had tires with a load index of 92 to start off, you want tires with at least an index of 92 or higher.

, The speed rating indicates that the tire can carry a specified load up to a certain speed. The most common speed ratings are S, T, U, H, V, Z, W, Y, and (Y).









S means a tire can travel 112 mph (180 km/h) for extended periods.
T means a tire can travel 118 mph (190 km/h) for extended periods.
U means a tire can travel 124 mph (200 km/h) for extended periods.
H means a tire can travel 130 mph (210 km/h) for extended periods.
V means a tire can travel 149 mph (240 km/h) for extended periods.
Z means a tire can travel over 149 mph (240 km/h) for extended periods.
W means a tire can travel 168 mph (270 km/h) for extended periods.
Y means a tire can travel 186 mph (299 km/h) for extended periods.
(Y) means a tire can travel over 186 mph (299 km/h) for extended periods.

, This signifies the tire's resistance to heat generated at high speeds on the tire's inside portion. This may be an A, B, or C rating with A being the highest resistance and C being the lowest.








,, This tells you the pressure the tire should be at to optimize tire performance.

, You will need to jack the car by placing the jack under the suspension arm so it compresses the suspension and relieves the tension on the link. (See your manual for proper jacking procedures and safety)

,, A bad link:

, You will have to grip the shaft below the sway bar so it does not turn - for example pair of vice grip locking pliers.The bottom bolt you can use a socket wrench on the nut, and a wrench on the nut on the other side of the mounting point (see picture).

, Simple insert the lower part first, then the upper. Be sure it is installed the same as the original - the bushings are touching the sway bar - from the top: nut, metal washer, bushing, sway bar, bushing, metal washer. The lower link is simply nut, mounting point, smaller nut. In this picture you see the new link, note the top bushing/washer/nut are not installed yet and it all needs to be tightened.

, When tightening the nuts, again you will need to use a socket wrench on the bottom on the larger nut, regular wrench on the smaller nut. Be sure to use the correct sizes so they do not strip/become damaged. On the top, a socket wrench and vice grips so the shaft does not spin.

, The bottom part should be tightened so the two nuts are against both sides of the mounting point so it has no free-play.

, Do this after everything is tightened on the link, make sure you have all your tools.

Tighten the axle nut.",How to Change a CV Axle," Before so much as jacking up the vehicle, you need to remove the axle nut. Start by removing the hubcap for the respective wheel of the CV axle to be replaced. For vehicles with rims, you may simply have a cap at the center of the wheel rather than a hubcap.;
, If your vehicle has a cotter pin securing the axle nut, you will need to remove it. The pin will resemble a bobby pin with the ends folded back to hold it in place.You will need to use pliers to straighten the two bent ends of the cotter pin before you can remove it.
If the pin is stuck, try spraying it the a penetrating lubricant from a hardware or automotive store.The lubricant should actually help with the axle nut as well.

, Once the cotter pin is out, you can remove the axle nut. The nut will take significant torque to remove, which is why it is much safer to remove the nut before jacking up the vehicle.


Unfortunately, axle nuts do not have a standard size, and the socket size required will be different for different vehicles. The parts department at a certified dealership for your vehicle make should be able to tell you the exact size if you want to check before starting the project.

, Next, you will need to remove the wheel, which requires lifting the vehicle. Consult your vehicle’s owner’s manual for the correct spot to jack up your car, and ensure that you pick a spot on the frame and not the much more fragile body.


Double-check that the vehicle is in park and that the parking brake is engaged before jacking up the vehicle.

, Once you have the vehicle lifted enough to place your jack stand, ease it back down onto the stand, which is more stable than the jack alone.


If you have concerns about using jack stands, consult Use Jack Stands for more information.

, The lug nuts securing the wheel will already be exposed from when you removed the hubcap. Remove the lug nuts and the wheel the same way you would if you were changing a tire.


If you need guidance for this step, you can consult Change a Tire for assistance.

, Once the wheel is off, the brake caliper and brake rotor will be clearly visible. The caliper housing is the larger piece attached to the outside of the rotor.


The caliper will be held in place on the rear side of the rotor by bolts in a mounting bracket.The specific configuration will depend on your make and model year vehicle. The mounting bracket most commonly uses 17mm bolts.Since the caliper is connected to your vehicle’s brake line, you want to keep slack in the brake line instead of letting it hang. You can easily suspend the caliper from a short bungee cord to keep it out of your way without putting too much stress on the brake line., The outer tie rod is literally a rod bolted to the steering knuckle, which is just behind the rotor. This piece will likely be bolted with another 17mm bolt.Like the axle nut, this bolt may be held in place with a cotter pin.
Penetrating lubricant may help you more easily remove the pin and bolt.
The tie rod may still be pretty snug in the steering knuckle even after removing the bolt. Tape the steering knuckle joint with a hammer (hitting the knuckle where the rod goes through and not the threaded portion of the tie rod) to help remove it., Two more 17mm bolts will connect the wheel hub to the strut tower. Once you remove these bolts, the hub should only be connected by the axle through the center hole, and you should easily be able to remove it.


Since these are actual bolts, you will need to secure the head of the bolt while loosening the nut, or it will just turn., Follow the axle back, and you will see the actual joint where it slides into the transmission. You can use a small pry bar or sturdy flathead screwdriver to pry the axle from the joint.If the axle doesn’t immediately come loose, try twisting it back and force to break the seal.It’s normal for some transmission fluid to leak out as you remove the axle from the cv joint. You should put down a catch pan.
On your vehicle, the axle may have to pass through an enclose piece called a wishbone before it’s completely free. You can remove the band from the inner boot to help the old axle pass through., Just as you removed the old CV axle, insert the new one into the same spot in the transmission housing. The peg will slide all the way in until the axle is flush against the housing.There is a small C-clip on the axle that you will feel snap into place.If the axle isn’t quite flush, you can use a rubber mallet to gently tap it into place., The new axle will have to be reinserted into the center of the hub assembly at the same spot where you removed the old axle.

, Starting with the hub assembly to the strut tower, refasten all of the bolts you removed. Reconnect the outer tie rod to the steering knuckle next, and then reattach the caliper.


Any old cotter pins may be brittle, so you should replace them with new ones rather than reusing the old pins., By this time, you can put the wheel back on the vehicle (again, the same as you would when changing a tire).


After the wheel is on, you can lower the car off the jack and jack stands.

, Finally, you can retighten the axle nut once the vehicle is back on the ground. Make sure that you still have the parking brake engaged while tightening.


It’s not a bad idea to clean the threaded part of the axle with a brake cleaner in case any grease has gotten on it while feeding it through the hub."

Close up the oil fill cap.",How to Add Oil to Your Car," If you check the oil right after turning the car off you will get an inaccurate reading, as some of the oil will still be at the top of the engine. Keep the car on a level, even surface as well to make sure you aren't checking the oil on a slant.Most auto manufacturers require you check the oil after the car has been warmed by starting it in place for 3-5 minutes. Check your owner's manual if there is any doubt.To be safe, you should check your oil every month, and more frequently if you have to drive long distances.;
, Usually you need to pull a small lever or press a button near the driver's seat to unlock the hood. From there, run your hand between the hood and the body of the car until you find a small lever, usually in the middle of the hood, and press it inward to completely free the hood.


, This small, usually yellow cap with a loop is often labeled ""Engine Oil,"" but even if it is not it is not difficult to find. The dipstick is a long piece of metal that extends down a tube to the oil pan, telling you, based on how high the oil line is, how much oil is in the engine. It is nearly close to the front of the car, and has a brightly colored circular or hook-shaped handle that you can use to pull out the stick without touching any oil., Oil from the engine will spurt up on the dipstick when the car is running, meaning you should clean it and reinsert it to get an accurate reading. Note the marks near the middle or bottom of the stick, often dots, lines, cross-hatched squares, or bends in the stick. The highest mark is the ""Full Line,"" and your oil should be somewhere between the two lines., This time you should note where the oil is on the stick. It should be closer to the top mark than the bottom, usually as close as you can get it. However, unless the level is at or below the minimum mark you do not need to add more oil.If the line is close and you are unsure whether or not to add oil, drive the car and check the oil again after 2-3 weeks.

, Is the oil black, brown, or clear? Is the dipstick itself clean, or mottled and dark? Oil may start out light tan, but it will always darken with use as the engine runs, collecting impurities from the combustion cycle and from getting hot. Its color is also dependent on mileage. For example, if you are driving an older car 5000 miles a month, your car might burn a quart of oil a month.



If the oil looks milky or white you could have a coolant leak and must get the car towed to a mechanic immediately.
If the oil has metallic particles or bits in it, get it to a mechanic immediately.If the oil seems dirty or sludge-like, it's time to change your oil.You should not be filling up the oil every few weeks or month -- this could be the sign of a leak., There are not too many reasons to switch from the recommended oil in the owner's manual, but that oftentimes doesn't make buying oil any easier. Understanding the different numbers and ratings on motor oil packaging will make you a better consumer and can help keep your car running smoothly., Viscosity represents a fluids thickness, or resistance to flowing. A high viscosity is less likely to flow smoothly because it is thicker (yogurt is more viscous than milk, for example). There are two numbers for viscosity of an oil, represented in combination, like 10W-30 or 20W-50. The first number, with the W, is for the winter temperature of the oil. This tells you how well it flows in cold weather when it the oil is thicker. The second number is how well the oil maintains its thickness in heat.



The first number should be at least 5W or lower if you live in very cold areas (see your owner's manual), as oil can get too thick for the car to start if the winter viscosity is too high.
Your owner's manual will have a recommended viscosity rating for your car. If there is only one number, as found in some older cars, your car uses a ""single-weight"" oil., This will help make sure your car stays healthy and under warranty. Each motor oil has several different certifications possible, from the starburst-shaped API to ILSAC recommended guidelines. Make sure whatever oil you use meets the standards put forth by your manufacturer.



Some certifications change as the get more modern. The current API designation is SL, though it has been SJ and SI before. Again, refer to your manual for your car.

, Though more effective, synthetic oils are also more expensive than their natural counterparts.



Blending oils, however, is perfectly acceptable, so you do not have to shell out for pure synthetic oil if it seems too expensive., If your car has been running fine on a single weight oil (one viscosity rating), you don't want to switch now. This could cause sludge and grime that built up in the engine to dislodge and cause problems. Stick with what the car is used to and needs -- switching to a high-performance oil later will only cause more problems.



Consider switching in a higher weight oil (40 for 30) for the summer months, when it gets hotter, instead of switching to a multi-weight oil like 20W-40W., You should top up your car immediately if you are at or below the proper oil level to prevent damage to your car. Adding oil to your car, however, is not a substitute for replacing your oil on a regular basis.



Always check your owner's manual to see how often you need to get your oil changed -- it may be as soon as 3,000 miles or as infrequently as every 20,000 miles. Most experts recommend changing oil every 5,000 miles., Check your owner's manual to see what oil is right for your car, or talk to your mechanic. Do not switch away from the recommended oil unless you have a very good reason -- it will not necessarily make your car perform better unless it is made for that oil.


, You need to pull a lever or press a button by the driver's seat to get the hood up. Return to the front of the car and run your hand between the hood and the body until you find a lever, usually in the middle of the hood. Press it inward to completely free the hood and expose the engine.


, It is almost always labeled oil with a small picture of an oil can on the top. If you have trouble, check the owner's manual, though it is usually found near the front of the car near the engine and the dipstick. Unscrew the top and set it aside.


, Usually, the difference between the bottom of the stick and the top is 1 quart,so you can use this to estimate how much oil you want to add. If it is halfway full, for example, you need to add half a quart of oil. That said, you should always add the oil in quarter quart increments to prevent overfilling, as this can cause serious engine issues.


, Add oil for 2-3 seconds, wait a minute, and then check the dipstick. Clean it off when done, add some more oil, and check again. You want the oil level to be close to the top mark on the dipstick, so get it as close as you can without overflowing.



A funnel will make it easier to add oil without spilling it on the engine.

, You should rarely need to add more than a quart of oil. If you do, there may be more serious issues at play in the engine, and you should check the oil again within a week to check if it's leaking. Otherwise, your engine should be good to run. Remember to get your oil changed when it is dirty or after 5,000 miles."

Look in the owners' manual or on the inside of the driver's side door for the standard cold tire inflation pressure.,
Unscrew the valve stem cap from the valve stem on the tire.,
Press the air pressure gauge evenly onto the valve stem and record the reading given.,
Replace valve stem cap.,
Know that the manufacturer's PSI recommendations don't translate into optimum tire performance.,
Understand the myth about the max press value in the owner's manual or driver's side door.,
Add a few extra pounds of pressure to the back tires if you're carrying extra cargo, carpooling, etc.,
Check the air pressure of your tires as the seasons change.,
Never rely on the eyeball method to gauge air pressure in tires.",How to Check Air Pressure in Tires," This number is the lowest PSI one would inflate the tires to and is suggested by the car's manufacturer. Read below for reasons inflation may be placed higher.









For most sedans, minivans, and even mini pickups, manufacturers generally recommend a PSI (pounds per square inch) in the range of 27 to 32, but can reach all the way up to 40.For larger vehicles that need to carry a larger burden, such as trucks and SUVs, the PSI is generally 4 to 8 PSI greater than it would be in smaller cars, perhaps around 45.
Also note that the front and back tires may need different pressures, according to the manufacturer.;
, The valve stem is a black or silver pencil-sized extension near the hubcap, about 1"" (2-3 cm) long.








, If there is a hissing sound, the gauge is not tight or even enough for an accurate reading. The angle of the gauge may need to be adjusted.









If you are using a digital model gauge, you may or may not need to press a button in order for the gauge to read the air pressure. If you are using a traditional gauge, the metered stick should give you a reading automatically.

, The cap does not hold air in, but it keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve mechanism in the valve stem, which does hold air in.









Note that if the reading is the same as the manuals' specifications, you are done after checking all other tires for the same pressure. If inadequate pressure is in the tires then fill air in the tires. Make sure you put in the correct amount.

, For all-around driving, the manufacturer's specifications are probably ideal, but adding a couple extra pounds of pressure into your tires may mean better fuel efficiency. Overall, adding a few pounds of PSI to your tires may make your ride a bit bumpier and less pleasant, so use with tact!


An increase in PSI can also result in uneven tire wear, longer required braking distances, and reduced handling. Make sure you don't over-inflate your tires.

, One popular misconception is that the max pressure suggested by the manufacturer is all the pressure the tire can handle before it pops or malfunctions. In truth, the max pressure is the pressure at which the tires will carry the maximum amount of weight.

As soon as you inflate the tires past the max pressure limit, be prepared for the possibility of malfunction. If your tires are bearing heavier air pressure, a pothole at high speeds could spell disaster.

, If you happen to be carrying a heavier load in your car, especially if you are traveling for longer distances, don't be afraid to add a few pounds of PSI to your rear tires to offset the added weight. When the weight is unloaded, release the pressure from the rear tires back to its standard specifications.

, Cold weather will reduce the air pressure, while warm weather will increase the air pressure. It's therefore very important to check tire pressure when the seasons change.

, Don't get lazy. It's very difficult to tell the difference between a tire with 10 PSI and 20 PSI. Plus, tires normally exhibit a bit of a bulge on the sidewall of radial tires. If you inflate the tires until the bulge is gone, you run the risk of seriously over-inflating your tires, past the point at which they get a performance boost.

Look for the reservoir cylinder.,
Check the level of the power-steering fluid.,
Examine how much of the dipstick is covered by power-steering fluid.,
Examine the color of the power-steering fluid.,
Add power-steering fluid as needed to the correct fill level.,
Replace the cylinder cap.",How to Check and Add Power Steering Fluid," If you're having difficulty turning the steering wheel or a high-pitched whining noise issues from the steering wheel when you turn it, chances are your power-steering fluid is low. The power-steering fluid can be found in a cylindrical reservoir near the power steering pump or remotely located with hoses from the pump, and should be clearly labeled. The cylinder may be made of either plastic or metal.


If you can't find the cylinder, consult your owner's manual for the location. While the power-steering reservoir is usually located in the same space in most cars, newer vehicles may place them elsewhere for economy or space.;
, If the reservoir cylinder is made of translucent plastic, you may be able to see the fluid level inside the cylinder. If the reservoir cylinder is made of metal, or if the plastic is not sufficiently transparent, you'll check the fluid level with a dipstick, which is usually attached to the cap.


On some cars, the power-steering fluid level can only be checked accurately after the engine has run for a brief period, and sometimes you must also turn the steering wheel in either direction several times while the car idles.
On other cars, there are gradations on the dipstick or cylinder for both a ""hot"" level, after the engine has been running, and a ""cold"" level, after the engine has been off for a period of time. On still other cars, there may be ""Min"" and ""Max"" lines for acceptable fluid levels. Be sure to compare the power-steering fluid level against the correct mark.

, If you are using a dipstick to test the power-steering fluid level, first wipe off any excess fluid from the dipstick when you first take it out of the cylinder, then reinsert it as far down as it will go and pull it out again.

, Good power-steering fluid should be clear, amber or pinkish in color.


If the power-steering fluid is brown or black, it has been contaminated with bits of rubber from connecting hoses, seals or O-rings. In this case, the car should be taken to a mechanic to see if any of the power-steering system parts need to be replaced, along with the fluid.
The power-steering fluid may look darker than it actually is. If you have any doubts, look at the color of the power-steering fluid stain on the rag or paper towel you wiped your dipstick off with. If the stain is the color the fluid is supposed to be, your fluid is not contaminated.

, If your car has gradations on the cylinder, you can add the fluid steadily until you reach the correct ""hot"" or ""cold"" fill level; if you checked the level with a dipstick, add the fluid incrementally to avoid overfilling the reservoir.


Be sure to use only the power-steering fluid that is recommended for your car, as it will be the correct viscosity (thickness) for your car's power-steering system.
The manufacture does not recommend using transmission fluid in place of power steering fluid. There are too many different types of fluid, and if the wrong fluid is used, it may cause failure of power steering and its seals.
Be careful not to overfill your power-steering unit with fluid. It's probably better to under fill your unit than overfill it. That's because power-steering fluid expands as it heats up and works its magic. If you fill your unit all the way to the top and then try to drive your car, the expanded pressure could begin to cause problems and might necessitate expensive repairs.

, Depending on the make of car, you may have to push or screw the cap into place. Be sure it's firmly attached before you close the hood.

Your owner's manual tells you when fluids must be checked, but this is just the minimum to keep your warranty in effect.,
Park the car on a flat, level surface and set the parking brake.
,
Open the hood.
,
Check the motor oil.,
Check the transmission fluid.,
Check the brake fluid.,
Check the power steering fluid.,
Check the coolant.,
Check the windshield washer fluid.,
Check your tire pressure.",How to Check the Fluids in a Car," Mark your calendar, or just check the fluids frequently.

,,, The oil should be checked after the car cools down for an hour or so, so that oil in the return galleries, cylinder head valleys, etc. is drained down so you don't get a false reading. Locate the oil dipstick (use the owner's manual). Hook a finger through the loop and pull the dipstick all the way out, releasing any clips that might be holding it in place. Use a paper towel or rag to wipe the dipstick clean so that you will have a clear reading. Insert the dipstick into its opening and push it firmly all the way back, as far in as it will go. Pull it out all the way, this time reading the oil level. When you are done, replace the dipstick in its opening.

The dipstick has markings on it indicating a range for acceptable oil level (usually notched, dimpled, or scribed). Double check the markings you see against the owner's manual. If the oil level is too low, appropriate motor oil must be added before the car can be driven. With a new car, take it to the dealer's service or parts department; have them show you how to add oil, and buy the oil and funnel their mechanics use. With an older car, take it to an auto parts store; they will walk to your car, show you where to add oil, and recommend what to buy. Since some engines consume more oil than others, adding oil can also become a frequent task.





Look at the color of your oil, too. Clean engine oil is a clear, golden color. Dirty engine oil is black or brown. If yours is dark, have a look at your car's records to see when the oil was last changed. Darker engine oil can still run a car just fine, so go by the schedule more than by the color.
You should also change engine oil according to both mileage and time. Consult your owner's manual for the proper intervals. Even if you don't drive the recommended number of miles, plan to change your oil about once every six months. Just sitting in the driveway, your car's oil can break down and become less effective. Change your oil more frequently than the recommended schedule if your car gets severe use.
Repeated, pronounced loss of engine oil can indicate a leak in a gasket or that your car is consuming oil. Keep a watchful eye on your driveway where you park. Also look for signs of oil leaks on the outsides of the engine, and if you see any oil or consistently consume oil, take your car to a mechanic and explain what you have seen.
If the oil looks milky or foamy, it may be contaminated with coolant, and should be checked by a mechanic. This condition could indicate a blown head gasket or other serious problems.

, This is usually done with the engine running and fully warmed up, either in neutral or park, depending on the make and model. It will be the second of two dipsticks. As with the oil, locate it, pull it out (releasing any clips), wipe it off, push it all the way back in to the bottom of its travel, then pull it out and read the level. Again, look for a level between the two marks on the dipstick.

This transmission fluid is reddish. Transmission fluid does not need to be changed as frequently as oil, but it does occasionally need to be changed. The interval may be as much as 100,000 miles (160,000 km) in newer cars; consult your manual to be sure. If yours looks brown, black, or burnt, or its appearance suggests that it didn't come out of a bottle lately, consider replacing it. Transmission fluid lubricates the transmission, your car's gear system.






, Consult your manual for the location, or look around for a plastic reservoir such as this one labeled brake fluid. If your reservoir looks like this one, you can read the level of fluid right through the plastic. Wipe dirt off the outside, if you need to. It might help also to jostle the car gently on its suspension with your hip, hands, or knee, so that the fluid level jiggles a bit. If you still can't see it, take the cap off and look in.

Cars should not consume brake fluid. Low brake fluid can indicate either a leak in the brake line or worn brake surfaces. If your brake fluid is low, have the car checked to find out why. A car with low brake fluid or leaking brake fluid could fail to stop.

, This will generally also be a plastic reservoir. Read it through the walls, as you did with the brake fluid, by opening the lid and pouring in more of an appropriate power steering fluid. There may be two pairs of lines, one for a hot engine and one for a cold engine. Read the one that is appropriate to the current condition of your car.

Some cars are now equipped with electronic power steering and will not have a reservoir.

, Be sure the engine has cooled down, otherwise scalding water could spray out as you open the reservoir! The coolant will most likely be in a reservoir up front, near the radiator.

Cars are designed to operate with antifreeze as coolant, not water. Antifreeze is a mixture that has a lower freezing point and generally, a higher boiling point than water. If you must replenish your coolant, go buy a bottle of the correct stuff.
Read the label on antifreeze. Some formulations are intended to be mixed half and half with water; others should be poured in at full strength. The antifreeze label will tell you which type you have.
Sometimes there can be coolant in the reservoir but no coolant in the radiator. If the car is running hot and there is coolant in the reservoir, then you need to remove the radiator hose to check for fluid in the radiator.

,

Wiper fluid won't affect the performance of your car, but this is what comes out when you use the sprayers to clean your windshield while driving.
Washer fluid that's formulated to clean off bugs and other road grime is inexpensive, so it's worth getting the real thing, though topping off with a little water will do in a pinch.
There is generally no harm in having low washer fluid. You will naturally use this up as you drive your car and clean the windshield. Simply refill it before it gets completely empty.
If you are expecting very cold weather, be sure to use washer fluid that won't freeze in low temperature. Wiper fluid with a low freezing point is specially marked as such.

, It's not one of the fluids under the hood, but it is essential to the efficiency and safety of your car. You should check your tires even more often than your engine fluids. While you're there, check the tread on your tires."

Open the hood.",How to Add Windshield Washer Fluid to Your Vehicle," The windshield washer fluid reservoir may be located in a number of places depending on the year, make and model of your vehicle. It is usually mounted along the side of the engine bay, and can often be found near the windshield along the firewall.The windshield washer fluid reservoir will be marked with a symbol that looks like windshield with wipers moving.
If you are unable to locate the reservoir, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.;
, Once you locate the reservoir, identify the low and high fill lines along the side. Most windshield washer fluid reservoirs are made of translucent plastic with lines along the side that indicate how full with fluid the reservoir is. Verify that the reservoir is indeed low on fluid before adding more.








If the windshield washer fluid reservoir is full but will not spray, it could be due to clogged lines.
If the low washer fluid light came on in your car but the reservoir is full, it may be due to a faulty sensor.

, Twist the cap counter-clockwise to unscrew it and lift it off of the reservoir. Set the cap aside someplace safe. Be sure you don’t put it down in dirt or debris so nothing accidentally falls into the fluid when you return the cap.








Dirt and debris is the reservoir can result in clogging the windshield washer lines.
Make sure the cap is not damaged. If it cannot be closed back onto the reservoir properly, the cap will need to be replaced.

, Use a funnel or the spout on the windshield washer fluid bottle to pour fluid into the reservoir until it reaches the “full” line on the side. Wipe up any spilled washer fluid with paper towels or a rag.








You should be able to see through the side of the reservoir to know when it is full.

, Because fluid can expand when heated, it’s important that you do not overfill the reservoir. When the fluid warms due to the high engine temperatures under the hood, the pressure could cause the reservoir to crack and leak if there is too much fluid in it.Use a turkey baster to suck extra fluid back out of the reservoir in the event you over fill it.

, With the reservoir filled with washer fluid, pick the cap up from where you stored it. Use a rag or paper towels to wipe the cap down to ensure there is no dirt or debris stuck to it.








Turn the cap clockwise to re-secure it on the reservoir.
If the cap is damaged, you can purchase replacement ones at your local auto parts store.

, Get back into the vehicle and insert the key into the ignition. Start the engine and engage the washer fluid in the manner you normally would to make sure it is working properly.








Most windshield washer fluid jets are activated by pressing or pulling the windshield wiper controls.
If you are unsure how to activate your windshield wiper fluid jets, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual.

, In order to be effective, it’s important that you not use just water in your windshield washer fluid. Regular windshield washer fluid is designed to prevent streaking and not to freeze if the temperature gets too cold. However, if you live in an area that frequently experiences extremely low temperatures, an anti-freezing washer fluid may be your best bet.Anti-freezing washer fluid can help defrost your windshield when a light layer of ice forms on it on cold mornings.
Other windshield washer fluids can contain chemicals that makes water bead off of the glass, allowing for increased visibility when driving in the rain.

, If you choose to purchase a concentrated windshield washer fluid, you will need to mix it with water before adding it to the vehicle. Like anti-freeze, concentrated windshield washer fluid can usually be mixed with water at a 50








A 50/50 ratio of water to fluid means half water, half fluid.
Follow the directions provided on the specific brand of concentrated washer fluid you purchase.

, In order to get an accurate understanding of how much washer fluid is still in your vehicle, as well as how much you have added, it’s important that the reservoir sits level. In order to do so, park the vehicle on an even, flat surface.








Parking at an angle such as on a hill will make it difficult to read how much fluid is in the reservoir.

, To open the hood of your vehicle, locate the release near the door frame on the driver’s side. The release is usually labeled with a small symbol that represents the front of vehicle with the hood open. Pull the release toward you to disengage the hood latch. Once out of the car, you will need to release the safety latch as well.








Release the safety latch by pressing on the lever beneath the hood or through the grill at the front of the vehicle.
If you are unsure where to locate the release, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.

Assess whether the clutch disengages properly.",How to Add Brake Fluid to the Clutch Master Cylinder," In order to evaluate the level of brake fluid in the clutch master cylinder, it is important that your vehicle is level. Parking on a hill or at an angle can cause the level in the master cylinder reservoir to read incorrectly.You may want to allow the vehicle to cool for an hour or two to prevent burning yourself when checking the fluid levels.
Parking at an angle may make it appear that you have more or less brake fluid than you actually do.;
, Find the hood release on the driver’s left hand side. It is usually located near the door frame with a small image of a car with its hood open. Pull the release back toward you to release the hood. Approach the vehicle from the front and pull the hood up slightly. It will catch on the safety release. Slip your hand beneath the hood and find the lever to release it.In some vehicles, the safety release is located in the grill rather than under the hood.
If you are unable to locate the release, check in your vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.

, With the hood propped open, locate the clutch master cylinder. It is usually located on the firewall of the vehicle, just below the windshield. It will have a plastic reservoir that will be either clear or semi-clear with lines indicating the fluid level inside.If you are having difficulty locating the clutch master cylinder, refer to your vehicle’s service manual for assistance.
The clutch master cylinder is usually on the driver’s side of the vehicle.

, Inspect the reservoir attached to the clutch master cylinder. There will be at least two lines indicating a minimum acceptable level of brake fluid and a maximum. If the brake fluid does not reach the “full” line, you should add fluid. If it is close or below the minimum line, you should inspect the master cylinder and clutch system for leaks.If the brake fluid is well below the minimum line, there may be a leak somewhere in the system.
Leaks not only allow brake fluid to escape, but allow pockets of air to enter which can cause further issue when operating your clutch.

, Most vehicles use one of three common types of brakes fluid. It is extremely important that you purchase the correct type of brake fluid for your clutch master cylinder to avoid doing damage to the system or preventing the clutch from engaging. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to identify what the specific type of brake fluid you need for your vehicle.Most vehicle’s require SAE J1703, US FMVSS or 116 DOT 3 brake fluid in the clutch master cylinder.
If you do not have a copy of the owner’s manual for your vehicle, look for the information you need on the automaker’s website.

, Poke a hole in the seal on the mouth of the brake fluid, then tear a larger hole on the opposite side. This will allow the brake fluid to pour from the container in a controlled and easily directed fashion. Open the reservoir attached to the clutch master cylinder and pour brake fluid in until it reaches the “full” line.You can tear the seal off of the brake fluid container completely, but it will make it harder to direct your pour without spilling any.
Be careful not to overfill the reservoir as it may cause the clutch to not function properly.

, Be aware of any dirt or debris that may fall into the clutch master cylinder while it’s open. Even a small amount of sediment can create significant problems for the clutch system. Blocked lines can prevent the clutch from engaging or create a buildup in pressure that can result in leaks.If anything falls into the brake fluid in the open master cylinder, try to scoop the debris out or dab at it with a dry cloth.
Keep the lid on the clutch master cylinder reservoir at all times when not filling it.

, Once the reservoir if full of brake fluid, inspect the lid for signs of damage before screwing it back on. If the threads on the lid are crossed or damaged, it may prevent a seal from occurring. A failed seal will allow air to enter the clutch lines, which will cause issues with the function of the clutch.If the lid is damaged, place it back on the reservoir and do not drive the vehicle until you purchase a replacement.
Replacement lids can be found at your local auto parts store.

, Press and depress the clutch pedal with the vehicle running. Feel for inconsistency in the pressure required to do so. Varying levels of pressure are a good indicator that there are pockets of air in the clutch system. If there are any air pockets in the system, you will need to bleed the clutch to remove them.Pockets of air can cause the clutch to not engage or disengage properly.
Air in the clutch lines can be a symptom of a leak, so be sure to check carefully for one.

, The clutch master cylinder should be dry and free of sticky grime or sludge. If it is covered in grime, clean it off with a rag and some brake cleaner to make it easier to identify signs of a leak. If the brake fluid in the reservoir was very low before filling it, there may be a leak.Once you’ve cleaned the master cylinder, start the vehicle and have a friend press the clutch a few times.
Look for signs of bubbles or fluid leaking from the master cylinder.
Check the reservoir and master cylinder again after a few days to ensure there are no leaks.

, If you did not identify any signs of leaking on the master cylinder or the cap for the reservoir, follow the lines leaving the master cylinder all the way to the slave cylinder. Check the lines and slave cylinder for signs of leaking or bubbling fluid.If you locate a leak, you should have it repaired immediately.
After sealing a leak, you will need to bleed the clutch system.

, Put the vehicle in first gear and depress the clutch pedal as you apply gas to begin moving forward. Press the clutch again and shift into second gear. If there are any issues with getting the vehicle into our out of gear, it could be a result of the clutch failing to engage and disengage. If you have difficulty getting the transmission into gear, take the vehicle to a service professional to be diagnosed.A failed clutch will not allow you to put the vehicle in gear at all.
Slight grinding between gears may be due to clutch pressure issues, but may also be caused by failing synchros within the transmission.

Leave the car idle for 5-10 mins to get the oil warm. Be sure to exercise caution when draining warm or hot oil.;
, Exit the vehicle.




, Tire restraints (wheel blocks) should be placed on the tires that will remain on the ground.




, If you are unsure, check the owners manual for specifics.




,





You will only need to do this on one side.

,, Apply force by rocking the vehicle to assure it is safe.




,





Let car sit for 10 mins to cool down. Engine/exhaust could be hot, be careful.

, You will be needing the appropriate oil filter and new clean oil for your vehicle.

, Open the hood and locate the oil cap on top of the engine.




, Under your car, look for a flat metal pan closer to the engine than the transmission.





Locate engine drain plug.
Verify that is the engine oil drain plug, not the transmission drain plug. If you are unsure which is which, look for the exhaust. The exhaust is always attached to engine, as is the tube that travels from the front of the vehicle to the back. The oil pan and drain plug will be located below the engine.

, Loosen the plug counter-clockwise using the proper sized socket or a crescent wrench if you have room to maneuver. You should also remove and replace a paper or felt drain plug gasket. A metal washer can be re-used in good condition.




, It will take several minutes for all the oil to drain out of the car. When the oil has ceasing running out of the crankcase, replace the plug. Put new washer on the drain plug. Inspect and clean 3 areas: drain, plug, and gasket. Put the new gasket on the drain plug.




, Filters are not put in a standard position, so they can be on the front, back or side of the engine depending on the model.


Look at the replacement filter you purchased to have some idea of what to look for. Typically, they're white, blue, or black cylinders about 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) long and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide, like a soup can.
Some vehicles such as BMW, Mercedes, and newer Volvos may have a filter element or cartridge as opposed to the simpler spin-on type. They require you to open the cap of a built-in reservoir and lift out the filter element itself.

, First, try by hand to get a good grip and twist slowly and steadily, counter-clockwise. If you are unable to remove the filter by hand, you will need an oil filter removal tool to do this. Make sure the drain pan is underneath the filter before fully removing the filter. This will help prevent spillage.





To avoid spilling too much oil as you remove the filter, you can wrap a plastic bag around the filter, which will catch any oil that escapes as you remove it. Let it sit upside down in the bag to drain as you complete the job.
Make sure the pan is still under the car catching the spilling oil. There will be some trapped in the filter that will come out when you unscrew it.

, Dip the tip of your finger in the new replacement oil and smear it on the gasket ring of the new filter. This will lubricate the gasket and create a good seal for the new filter, and ensure that you'll be able to get it off the next time.





You can also pour a tiny amount of oil into the filter prior to installing it. This will reduce the amount of time your car takes to regain proper oil pressure. If your filter is mounted vertically, you may be able to fill it almost to the top. If mounted at an angle then a small amount of oil will spill just prior to spinning the filter on.

, The filter will generally say how tight to tighten it; look to the specifications on the box for more specific instructions. In general, you'll tighten the filter until the gasket touches, then a quarter-turn more.




, The amount you need is in the owner's manual, usually listed under ""capacities.""





If you hold the bottle with the spout on top, it will pour more smoothly, without bubbling.
Make sure you're adding the correct oil. Typically, you can safely add 10W-30 to most cars in a pinch, but you should consult your owner's manual or the experts at an auto shop before adding oil.
Don't always rely on the dipstick for an accurate measurement; it can be off, especially if the engine has just been run (the stick will read low because there is still oil in the galleries). If you want to check the stick accurately, just check it first thing in the morning, parked on a level surface, when it's cold and settled.

, Check around for any loose tools you might have left around and close the hood.





Look under the car to make sure nothing is leaking. It's a good idea to wipe up any spills as best you can. While it's not dangerous to get a little oil on the crankcase as you're pouring, it may smoke as the engine heats up, leading to that burning oil smell that can be momentarily frightening. It can also make your interior smell bad.

, Watch to be sure the oil pressure light goes off after start-up. Put your car in park or neutral with the parking brake on to check for any drips and look carefully under the car to check for any leaks or drips. If the filter and drain plug aren't tight, they may leak slowly. Run the engine for a minute or so to get the pressure up and ensure you've installed everything correctly.





Optional: Reset the oil change light. This will differ depending upon the make and model of your car, so you should consult the owner's manual to figure out the specific set of steps. On most GM cars, for instance, you'll need to shut the car off and then turn the ignition on without turning the car over. Next, pump the gas pedal three times in ten seconds. When you start the car back up, the lights should be reset.

, Once vehicle has been turned off again and the oil has settled for 5 to 10 minutes, recheck the dipstick to ensure that the levels are where they need to be.




, Now that you've changed your oil, get the sludgy gunk into a more permanent container. Adding it to the new container you've just emptied is the safest bet. Use a plastic funnel in the bottle and pour slowly to ensure you don't spill any. Clearly mark the bottle ""used oil"" so you don't mistake it for the real thing.


Other options include old milk jugs, windshield washer-fluid jugs, or other plastic bottles. Be very careful anytime you're using old food bottles to clearly mark it.
Don't put old oil in containers that held chemicals like bleach, pesticides, paint, or antifreeze. These will contaminate the recycling process.

, You can add this oil (sometimes as much as 8 oz.) to the old oil. Filters are also recyclable, so hang onto them.

, Typically, all places that sell motor oil will have this information on hand. Retailers that sell more than 1,000 filters in a year are required to accept old filters.Many service stations that do oil changes will also take your used oil, though sometimes for a small fee.

, Used motor oil is refined until it meets the same certifications and specifications of virgin oil. The process requires less energy than pumping and refining new oil and recycling motor oil helps to reduce the need of foreign oil imported. In some cases, recycled oil also costs less than ""new"" oil.

Recheck the transmission fluid level after a test drive to make sure it is full.",How to Change the Transmission Fluid in a Honda Odyssey," Most mechanics recommend using only Honda OEM fluid, but other products will work if they are labelled ATF-DW or ATF-Z1. A normal fluid change will require about 3.3 US quarts (3,000 ml) (3 liters) of fluid.;
, The fluid drain plug can be reached without requiring you to actually get underneath the van, but it is always recommended you support the vehicle with jack stands before proceeding.

, You will find the drain hole behind the plastic shroud behind the front bumper.  Make sure to allow for the draining oil's trajectory, since it will at first flow out rather quickly.

, The drain plug has a recessed hole to accommodate the ratchet drive stud. Turn it counterclockwise until loose, then finish removing it with your fingers.

, This may take several minutes, but the objective is to replace as much of the old fluid as possible.

, The manufacturer and some aftermarket service manuals recommend always changing the aluminum crush washer with each change to prevent leaks. These can be purchased from your Honda dealer if you desire to replace them.

, Remove the jack stands or supports and lower it with the jack.

, This will require a 17mm socket and a 15 inch (38.1 cm) long extension, since it is below and behind the air breather assembly.  Sometimes breaking the filler plug may require using a cheater since the bolt can be very tight.

,, Hold the break and shift the transmission manually through all of the gears. Shut off the engine and check the fluid level. Many service guides and forums suggest repeating the process two or three times to remove more of the fluid, since draining the fluid only removes the fluid in the main transmission body and reservoir, leaving old fluid in the torque converter and valve body., Normally, a fluid change will require slightly more than 3 US quarts (3,000 ml). To check the fluid, drive the vehicle until it is warmed up and has shifted through all of the gears, park it on a level surface, and shut it off. Remove the dipstick between 60 and 90 seconds after turning the engine off, and make sure the level is between the two marks."

, It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands.

, If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them.

, It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.

, Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:


Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.

, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail.

, This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant.

, Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should:


Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed.
Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes.


The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction.
Once the drum is removed you can continue.

, These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them use the round, notched part of the brake spring pliers. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe.

, One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., Fasten the emergency brake cable to the replacement brake shoe on the same side your removed it. Pull up the cover again and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed it from). ., You will need to transfer the return spring (at the top of the shoe) and the small emergency brake spring (near the center of the shoe). If your vehicle has any other hardware on the brake shoe, transfer it to the new one as well. ., You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate. ., There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot.

, Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring.

, Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring and press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place.

, Now it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring.

, You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever.

, Here you will use the flat end of your brake spring pliers to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes.

, Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place.

, This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster.

, Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw).

, You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now.

, You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening.

, The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly.

, You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands.

, Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly.

, Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual.

, You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work.

, Before you drive your car you want to be sure that your new brake shoes are working properly.

Loosen the lugs.,
Jack up the car.,
Remove the wheels.,
Locate the brake caliper.,
Remove the brake caliper as a single unit.,
Inspect the brake pads for wear or damage.,
Make note of any damage on the calipers.,
Take a close look at the brake rotor.",How to Service Brakes1," While the car is on the ground, you should use a lug wrench or an impact wrench to loosen the lug nuts. Doing it this way prevents the tires from spinning. This helps break the lugs loose more efficiently and more safely.






;
, Consult your service manual for safe jacking points. Slide the jack under the car and position it directly under the jacking point. Jack the car up and secure it with jack stands.








, Now that the car is lifted, the weight will no longer be on the tires. You can finish removing the lugs either by hand or with your wrench. Then, simply slide the wheel away from the wheelbase.









You should always slide the wheel underneath the car. This adds an extra layer of safety if the jack stands fail.

, Now that you have the wheel off, you will be looking directly at your brake rotor. Mounted on the rotor (usually to the right) you will see your brake caliper. The brake caliper holds the brake pads against the rotor on either side.

, Brake calipers differ slightly from car to car, but they are always held in place by bolts or clips.These are usually located at the top and bottom of the caliper.Once the bolts and







, Some brake pads have a groove in the middle that serves as an indicator for wear. If the groove is nearly gone, the pads are in need of changing. In any case, if the pad is less than ¼ inch thick or is chipped or damaged, it needs replaced., Your calipers should not need replaced, as they are designed to last for the life of the car. That being said, if there is damage on the caliper it might need replaced.Also, it is possible that the bolts or pins that hold the caliper in place could be damaged. If this is the case you will need to replace those., The brake disc, or rotor, is another important part of the braking system. When the brakes are applied, the pads press down on the rotor to create the friction needed for stopping. This generates a lot of pressure and heat. If your rotors are not thick enough, or if they have grooves or chips in them, they will need to be replaced.Minimum rotor thickness is generally stamped on the outside of the disc and can be measured using a micrometer, a side caliper, or a tape measurer.The micrometer is the easiest and most accurate measurement."

Remove the wheels.,
Remove the drum.,
Inspect the brake shoes.,
Identify and inspect your return springs.,
Change your wheel cylinder.",How to Service Brakes2," The drum brake is located behind the wheel. Once the wheel is out of the way, you will have access to the brake drum.

, Removing the drum will provide you access to the inner workings of your brakes, which are mounted on the backing plate. To do this, you will need to first remove the dust cap in the center. Underneath, there will be a retaining nut and cotter pin. Use pliers to remove the cotter pin and a socket to remove the nut. The drum should now slide off.If you have trouble sliding the drum off, check to be sure there are not additional bolts or clips holding it to the hub.It is possible for the brake shoes to get stuck against the drum. In this case, you will need to remove the rubber plug on the back of the backing plate to gain access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flathead screwdriver or brake adjuster bar to retract them., The brake shoe liners should not be less than the minimum recommended thickness. For the leading brake shoe (the one closest to the front of the car) this is usually around 1/8 inch. For the trailing brake shoe (the one closest to the back of the car) this is usually around 7/64 inch.Check your service manual for your car’s exact specifications and replace any brake liners that do not meet that standard.

, These springs are responsible for returning the brake shoes to their proper resting location after you remove your foot from the brake pedal. It is important that these springs are not damaged or loose. As long as the springs are still tight and are not damaged or overly rusted, you can continue to use them.If you need to remove the springs to replace them, or so that you can remove and replace your brake shoes, using brake spring pliers can make this a breeze.

, It is best practice to change the wheel cylinder anytime you have the brake drums off. The brakes will continue to work as long as the cylinder does not leak or stick, but it is impossible to look at the cylinder and determine how much wear is on the inside.To replace the wheel cylinder, you will need to first remove the brake line with a wrench. Next, unbolt the cylinder from the backing plate by removing the one or two bolts that hold it there. Install the new cylinder by bolting it into place where the original was, and then connecting the brake line.

Look for brake fluid on the outside of the master cylinder.,
Check your brake fluid.,
Check your brake lines.",How to Service Brakes3," This is the reservoir tank that stores brake fluid. It is located under the hood on the driver’s side firewall., This will indicate that the master cylinder is leaking. This will result in too little brake fluid in the system and will reduce your stopping power. Not having enough will result in a weak or spongy brake., Hydraulic braking fluid is the medium that allows force to be transferred from the brake pedal to the brake. Remove the lid from the master cylinder and look inside. The brake fluid should be all the way up to the “Full” line. If it is not, you will need to add brake fluid and follow any air purging techniques that your service manual recommends.Do not let dirt or other contaminants fall into the master cylinder. This will compromise your brake system. When your done checking your brake fluid, replace the master cylinder cap.You should also change your brake fluid as often as your owner’s manual recommends, otherwise it may absorb moisture from the air that corrodes the system and lowers the pressure inside the brake lines by allowing the fluid to boil., If you have rubber brake lines, make sure that there are no punctures, leaks, or deterioration along the entire length of the line. If you have metal brake lines, you should also check for corrosion or rust. If you see any of these signs of deteriorating brake lines, you will need to replace your lines."

Examine your brake lines and replace any damaged or broken lines.,
Install a new master cylinder.,
Inspect your car's brake discs.",How to Troubleshoot Your Brakes," There are two basic subsystems on passenger cars, the deceleration system, a hydraulically functioning, operator controlled dynamic braking system, and a parking brake system, which is activated by a mechanical linkage and prevents to car from moving while it is parked. Here are specific problems you may observe on each:



Parking brakes

Failure to engage. If the parking brakes fail to engage, the car may roll when left unattended.

Check the distance the control handle or pedal travels. If the control travels its limit and the brake doesn't engage, you either have a broken cable or linkage, or the brake drum/disk assembly is not working correctly.
Determine if the brake stays engaged when you apply it. If not, the mechanism which holds it engage, either a cam or gear type locking mechanism is broken or out of adjustment.


Failure to disengage. Make sure the brake disengages when you release it. If the parking brakes fail to disengage the powertrain will be working against the parking brake system when you drive causing it to work harder, wearing and overheating the brake components.

Sticking drum/rotor components can cause the parking brake to fail to disengage.
Cables or linkages can cause the system to fail to disengage.





Deceleration braking components.

The master cylinder provides hydraulic fluid pressure to cause the slave cylinders to engage the friction component (either shoes or pads, depending on the car's configuration) to engage the drums or rotors which slow the rotation of the wheel. The master cylinder is mounted to the firewall underneath the car's hood on the driver's side. Check the following to determine if you have a problem with the master cylinder:

Check the fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir. Some cars have a translucent reservoir that allows you to see the fluid through the side, others require you to unscrew or remove the clamps and take the lid off the reservoir. There should be a fill line and add line marked clearing on the side of the reservoir.
Check the area around the master cylinder for leaking brake fluid. This can indicate a damaged reservoir or the seals inside the master cylinder itself leaking and allowing the fluid to escape.



Slave cylinders cause the brake shoes or pads to engage the drums or rotors. They are located on each axle, either on the rotor assembly or inside the brake drum, depending on which system your car utilizes.

Check each hub for leaks. You can usually do this by looking at the back of each wheel to see if there is evidence of fluid dripping or accumulating on the inside surface of the wheel assembly.



;
, You will want to find an empty parking lot or quiet side street to do this.


Check the brake pedal travel by starting your engine and applying pressure to the pedal while the car is in the park or neutral position.

Begin by pressing gently and seeing how far the pedal moves before encountering resistance. Normal travel varies from one car to another, but generally, should not be more than 1/4 of the distance from its highest position and the floor of the car.
Press harder on the brake pedal and hold a steady, firm pressure to see if the pedal fades, or gradually begins to move downward while you hold it.
Pump the pedal rapidly a few times to see if it returns to the same position under pressure each time. If the pedal stops at a higher position when the brakes are pumped, you may have air trapped in your brake lines.


Release the parking brake and put the car in Drive or first gear and engage the transmission by releasing the clutch.
Listen for scraping or squeaking sounds from the car's axles while the brakes are not in use. There are a number of moving parts in action when the car is rolling including the rotors, bearings, and gears, so some sound is normal, but hard scraping sounds or squeaking may indicate a brake problem.
Press down lightly on the brake pedal and listen to see if any sounds you hear increase or disappear. A steady rubbing sound indicates uniform contact of the brake components, where an irregular scraping or rubbing sounds indicates a warped brake rotor or drum.

, Be particularly alert for vibrations or a change in resistance felt in the brake pedal. This is a warning there may be air in the brake's hydraulic system.


Accelerate your car to as safe a speed as possible in your location, up to about 20 mph (32 km/h), and apply the brakes stiffly. Observe if the car's wheel seems to pull in either direction. An ineffective brake will cause the car to pull to the opposite side, whereas, a sticking brake will cause the car to pull sharply to the side the brake is sticking on.

, Park your car on a firm, level surface, preferably on a paved driveway or garage floor. Chock the wheels, and raise one wheel with a floor jack if available. Install jack stands if you are going to work on wheels while they are elevated. (For spoke type wheels, brake rotors may be visible while the wheel is on the ground.)


Look at the surface of the car's brake rotors (if equipped with disc brakes). They should be smooth and shiny, with a uniform silver color. Purple or bluish discoloration indicated they have been overheated, roughness, swirling groove, or splotchy and grainy surface appearance indicates abnormal wear or rotor warpage.
If the wheel is lifted off the ground, try to rock it to see if there is any unusual movement in the wheel bearings assembly. Rotate the wheel so you can listen for sounds of uneven brake contact. Now have an assistant engage the brake and check to see if the wheel becomes immobile.

, It should be somewhere between the full and low mark. Never ""top off"" your brake fluid if it's not below the ""too low"" mark. As the brake pads naturally wear down, the piston pushing them against the rotor will adjust, drawing more fluid. Installing new pads resets the piston to its original position. ""Topping off"" the brake fluid when pads are worn may cause overflow and other issues once new brake pads are installed.

, If you hear a squealing or grinding noise when you apply the brakes, it may be a sign that you need to replace your brake pads. Excessive brake dust on your wheels is an additional sign of brake pad wear. Grabby brakes or brakes that seem to vibrate can indicate that your pads are worn out, too. It's often wise to turn the rotors or replace them when you replace your car's brake pads.

, A faulty brake power boost unit causes the brake pedal to depress more than usual in order to activate the brakes.

, If your brake pedal is hard to press down, it's likely that your vacuum system needs repairing.

, Contaminants in your brake fluid may cause your brakes to function incorrectly. If your brake pedal pushes down further than normal to activate the brakes, it may be a sign of contaminated fluid.

, A hard to press brake pedal is an indicator of a blocked brake line.

, If your brake pedal seems to have no pressure and your car doesn't brake well, you might need a new master cylinder.

, Bad discs result in grabby brakes or a vibration when braking. One disc may be the problem, or all of them may need to be replaced.

Get a mask that's designed for the job of filtering asbestos, not a simple paper one you might use in a shop. Send the kids and pets away, too. Especially the kids—you don't want them anywhere near this project, not even for a moment.;
, Block the front wheels with wheel chocks. Jack up the car and support it with jack stands.



Never work on a car supported by a jack alone. Blocks of wood or bricks or even cinder blocks aren't suitable substitutes.
Finish removing the nuts and remove the tire.

,


Note: WD-40 is not a penetrating oil.

, It may help to wiggle it a bit as you pull. It may be necessary to back off the brake adjuster to remove the drum. This is done through the brake adjustment hole in the drum or on the backing plate using a brake adjuster tool to turn the adjuster to loosen the brakes enough to remove the drum.

,,


It should be refaced or replaced if it is scored.
Drum brakes have a bunch of springs and levers for the self-adjuster and parking brake. They are usually different colors. Take a picture with a digital camera or make a detailed drawing of where everything is before you take anything apart!

, Doing this in a container will help keep the dust from becoming airborne. Remember: the dust from most brakes is asbestos, and you don't want to breathe it in. Wear a mask.

, Make sure they have holes in all the same places. Some vehicles have two different shoes called a leading and trailing shoe.


Make sure the brake shoes are the same width.

Make sure the vehicle is on a level surface, the transmission is in park, and the emergency brake is engaged.,

Starting on either side, locate the brake caliper (which is directly behind the tire).,
Lift the bottom of the caliper so that it pivots off of the top bolt.,
Remove both brake pads.,
Use the brake cleaner to spray down the entire brake assembly.
,
On the inside of the brake caliper is the piston which extends out towards the back pad.,

Use any leftover grease on the bottom bolt if it needs any.,
Put the tire back on and tighten the lug nuts as best as you can.,
Repeat steps 3-11 on the other side of the vehicle.,
Clear any tools from under the vehicle, and pump the brakes until they begin to firm up.",How to Replace the Front Brake Pads on a 1998 to 2002 Honda Accord," You may also place a block behind the back wheels to prevent the vehicle from rolling back.

Start on one side of the car and use the tire iron to break loose each lug nut on the tire. You only need to loosen it about an 1/8th of a turn. Be careful not to loosen it more than that.
Behind each front tire there is a metal lip (about 5in long) that you can use with the car jack to lift the vehicle. Raise the jack stand so that the pad sits sturdily under the metal lip. Then raise the vehicle just a few inches but not so that the tire is in the air.
Continue loosening and removing the lug nuts off the tire, then raise the vehicle so that the tire has at least an inch of clearance above the ground.
Place a jack stand under the vehicle's steel frame, behind the car jack. Then lower the car jack until the jack stand is supporting the vehicle. (You may need to raise the vehicle significantly to fit the jack stand under the frame.)
Remove the tire, and repeat the process on the other side of the vehicle.;
, It is mounted on top of the brake rotor (the large metal disk where the wheel studs come out of), and has two long bolts (top and bottom) in the back that hold it in place.

Use the 17mm socket wrench to remove the bottom bolt.

, This is done to reveal the brake pads underneath and to move the caliper out of the way.
, Notice that the two pads differ, and that the pads on the back side have a wear indicator which looks like metal tab that extends out the side of the pad.
,, Use a c-clamp to press the piston back into the caliper. You may use an old brake pad to make it easier. Compress the piston until it is all the way back.
, Use a generous amount on the area which the pad will come in contact with the caliper. This will be on the metal side of the pad (which is the opposite side of where the pad touches the brake rotor).
, Remember that the one with the wear indicator goes on the back side with the piston. Then carefully lower the bottom of the caliper back down, over the brake pads. The caliper now has space to slide in and out, so you may have to slide it out so that you can swing the caliper over the new brake pads.
, There is a black silicone slip on the bottom hole of the caliper. Slide the bottom bolt back in, making sure that it goes through the silicone slip, and then tighten the bolt. The silicone slip is so that the no dust or dirt can get on the bolt.
, Raise the car jack back into place and remove the jack stand. Slowly lower the car jack just enough so that there is pressure on the tire for you to tighten the lug nuts. Use a ""star"" pattern to tighten the lug nuts securely. Lower the car jack slowly until it clears the bottom of the vehicle. Double check that the tire is secure.
, Once this is complete, it is a good time to check the brake fluid under the hood. It is located on the driver's side, towards the back of the engine compartment. Fill as necessary.
, Start the vehicle and slowly test the brakes out. Start off with a slow speed, then come to a complete stop. Gradually test the brakes at increasing speeds in a safe area. Once you feel comfortable with the brakes, you are now done!

Replace a turn-signal cover that is mounted in a bumper, grill or leading edge of a fender using it as a clearance light.,
Grip behind the bulb much like you would if you were changing any light bulb.",How to Replace a Broken Taillight or Turn Signal Cover1," This type is found mostly in older vehicles and will be relatively easy to replace with only a screwdriver.


Locate the turn-signal cover and the screws that are holding it in place.
Use either a Phillips, slotted or, in some cases, a specialized screwdriver -- sometimes called a star -- to remove the screws holding the lens cover in place.
Gently pull out on the lens cover. If it is a two-piece unit -- lens cover and light bulb holder -- then replace the lens cover and screw it back into place.
If it is a combination lens and light bulb holder, pull out the unit exposing the light bulb holder and wiring.;
,


Turn counter-clockwise and pull the bulb holder from the lens case.
Reverse the procedure, reinserting the light bulb holder into the new turn-signal cover and screw it back into place on the vehicle.

"
"
Removal of the turn signal, headlight and the clearance light may be required, because they will most likely be integrated into one unit.,
Pull out the unit to get the back side of the unit.,
Reverse the process inserting the bulbs into the new unit.,
Verify once everything is reconnected that the turn signal is working correctly.",How to Replace a Broken Taillight or Turn Signal Cover2,"


You need a screwdriver and, depending on your vehicle, a standard (imperial) or metric deep-socket set. The socket set must have a ratchet wrench, extensions and an open wrench set.
Raise the hood and identify the connections or tie-down locations on the turn-signal, headlight and clearance light.
Disconnect all of the screwed down locations and nuts from the bolted sections.

,


This will give you access to the bulb holders for the turn signal, headlight and clearance light. You need to disconnect the turn signal cover from the individual bulb holders. There will most likely be three at the back of the broken lens, similar to changing any burned out bulb.

, Reconnect the turn signal, headlight and clearance light.

, For some vehicles, the turn-signal unit needs to be grounded to the metal body in order to work.

"
"
Use a screwdriver and, possibly, a set of open-end wrenches or sockets.,
Pull the lens away from the body of the vehicle.

,
Reverse the procedure.,
Understand that the procedure for replacing a broken taillight/turn-signal cover will be a little different for a small truck or pickup, depending on the age.,
Unscrew the cover from inside the bed, exposing the back of the taillight/turn-signal cover to unbolt the broken taillight for removal on some newer trucks.",How to Replace a Broken Taillight or Turn Signal Cover3," You may need a ratchet wrench as well, depending on the vehicle requirements.


Access will be from the inside of the trunk or cargo area on an SUV or typical car. You need to pull away or unscrew the cover from around the back of the broken taillight/turn-signal cover to gain access. This exposes the bulb connections at the back of the taillight.
Grip firmly at the back of the bulb and push it in. Twist counter-clockwise to remove it from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover.
You will either need to unscrew the broken taillight/turn-signal cover from the outside or unbolt (or unscrew) it from the inside of the cargo area or trunk, depending on how the taillight/turn-signal cover is held in place.

,, Check to see if the taillight/turn-signal cover is working once it is reinstalled.

, Those made prior to 1960 could have a separate taillight and turn-signal cover. However, the tools are the same.


You will find a screw holding the taillight in place on the back of the bed on some small trucks. Unscrew and remove the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed.
You will have exposed wires in the bulb holder once you have pulled the taillight/turn-signal cover from the bed. There may be more than one bulb holder.
Disconnect the bulb holder by gripping it firmly at the back and pushing in. Twist counter-clockwise and remove the bulbs from the broken taillight/turn-signal cover.
Reverse the process and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.

, Other than that, it is the same procedure as above.


Reverse the process as noted above and install the new taillight/turn-signal cover and check to see that it is working properly.

Consider the symptoms of the brakes; for example:


If the front brakes have been squealing loudly, you may need pads only.,
Determine the parts and tools you'll need.,
Buy more parts than you think you'll need.",How to Replace Disc Brakes1,"
If the car or brake pedal has been shaking when braking, you'll need to have the rotors resurfaced (called ""turning""), or replace them.
If the car pulls to one side while braking, but stays straight otherwise, you may need calipers. This is a sign of uneven wear of your brake pads caused by uneven pressure in your brake lines.
If the brakes have a grinding noise, this means rotors are done, spent, wasted, or whatever you want to call it, just replace them.;
, There are two bolts that hold the caliper to the pad bracket, and two bolts that hold the pad bracket to the steering knuckle. You may need both SAE and Metric sizes of wrenches and sockets, as well as bleeder screw wrenches. Also, you may need a set of hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a hex or star bit socket set.


Consider using line wrenches to remove calipers. Theses wrenches have a better bite and reduce the chances of rounding off hex nuts fitting on the hose end.

, You can always return what you don't use (keep your receipt and boxes and parts clean/undamaged). If you get caught without something while the car is apart, you may not have transportation to go buy anything.

"

Park the car in a clean, solid, well-lit place.,
Loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up (do not remove lug nuts yet).,
Jack the car up with a sturdy jack on a solid surface (such as a floor jack if you have concrete to work on) and lower it very slowly and carefully onto jackstands.,
Finish removing the wheels, and lay the wheels under the car, just to the rear of the jackstands.",How to Replace Disc Brakes2," Block the rear wheels with something heavy (like bricks or lumber which is small enough to jam under the wheels) to prevent the car from rolling or sliding while it's jacked up. Apply the emergency or parking brake to hold the rear wheels fast. (The vehicle's ""PARK"" gear will only hold one of the drive wheels, if you have a front-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your front wheels and if you have a rear-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your back wheels).

, If you skip this step, loosening the lugs may be very annoying, if not impossible. It is also somewhat dangerous to loosen lug nuts after a car has been jacked up.

, Caution: a floor jack's wheels need to be able to roll and the jack needs to travel a little and so it must not embed (sink) into a soft floor or surface.


Never work without jackstands that are on solid flat surface like stepping-stones or wide scraps of strong wood to keep the jackstands from sinking, leaning or tilting and falling, etc. Position the jackstands under a solid part of the car — the frame or subframe. You can easily damage the underside of the car, or even break something.






Give the car a couple of good hard, small shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift, slide off the jackstands, sink into asphalt, dirt or gravel, or just twist around and fall, better to learn now while the wheels are on than when you're partially under it with the wheels off.

, In case the car slips off the stands, those wheels may prevent you, your arms or head from being caught under a falling car (preventing the car from falling to the ground) if the jack stands fall over."

Remove the caliper from the pad bracket if necessary.,
Remove the pads and inspect them for wear.,
Apply anti-squeal paste to the backing of the new brake pads, but do not install them yet.,
Inspect the brake rotors: Always resurface the rotors with a crosshatch pattern if within spec, if the rotors are too thin to resurface replace them.,
Inspect the brake hoses.,
Remove brake rotors if turning or replacing them.,
Get the rotors resurfaced (""turned"") at a machine shop or auto parts store that turns rotors.,
Install the new or resurfaced (""turned"") rotors in reverse order of how they came off.,
Replace calipers if necessary.,
Drain the fluid from the caliper into a safe container for proper disposal.

,
Notice that the new caliper will come with two brass washers, plus rubber grommets for the slide pins, pad retaining clips (if applicable), possibly new slide pins, and maybe that hollow bolt mentioned above.,
Reattach the brake hose with a new brass or copper washer installed on both sides of the hose fitting, that the hollow ""banjo"" bolt goes through.,
Clean the caliper slide pins if you haven't done so yet.,
Compress the caliper piston, or in some cases screw them in if necessary.,
Clean up any brake fluid that may come out of the reservoir at this point.,
Put the new pads in the caliper or bracket.,
Place the caliper back into the pad bracket, and bolt it in.",How to Replace Disc Brakes3," (Some smaller economy-car calipers are simply held together by spring-clips, and it is very easy to remove the pads and to compress the piston without difficulty.) Larger car and truck calipers are much more hefty and are bolted in place. The pads may come out with the caliper, or stay in the bracket, depending on the car. Place the caliper on top of the steering knuckle, or hang it with a piece of clothes hanger wire or any other place where its weight won't be hanging on the brake hose, and will not fall.

, You may need to siphon out some brake fluid from the master cylinder to accommodate the fluid being forced out (by the brake caliper piston). You should remove the cap to the brake fluid reservoir and cover it with a paper towel or rag to prevent any foreign matter getting in there.


Some calipers have pistons that are made of ceramic or other sensitive materials, and merely prying them back with a screwdriver can crack them and require replacing the entire caliper. Consider using a C-clamp or piece of wood to force the piston back and allow the pads to be freed, as described below in installing new calipers.
If either pad is down to the metal pins or backing, you'll need to machine (turn) or replace the rotors.
This is also a good time to compare the wear pattern of the brakes on the left side of the car to the ones on the right side. If there is a vast difference, you'll need to replace the calipers or rotors.
Some rotors easily slide off from the wheel lug bolts, but some are made into the wheel-hub and will require getting into the wheel bearings and grease repacking see below.
Modern disc brake pads are ceramic, but older brake pads may contain asbestos, which can be harmful if inhaled in the form of ""brake dust."" If your brake pads contain asbestos, you can learn about how to clean and/or dispose of them here.

, Keep fluid and lubricants off of the brake pad material. Some cars, especially Ford Explorers/Mountaineers, have special lubricants on the caliper moving parts, and this lubricant cannot easily be obtained separately (ask for a ""heat resistant grease made for brakes"" from your auto shop). Try not to remove any of this where applicable. If these parts are dry and not lubricated, consider replacing the caliper, as you will probably notice other damage or signs of problems.

, A fresh rotor surface is required for proper break pad bedding

, If they are leaking by the fittings or damaged, they'll need replacing — but that is outside the scope of this article. If you are only installing brake pads, skip to the step beginning: Clean the caliper slide pins below.

, On most cars, the rotor is separate from the hub. Simply slide the rotor off of the lug studs. You may need to remove a set screw and/or use a rubber mallet to loosen the rotor. You may need an impact driver (hammer it while twisting counter-clockwise) to remove a set screw.


If the brake rotor and hub are one piece, remove the grease cup, cotter pin, and castle nut from the axle to allow removal. (Only if necessary, unbolt the pad bracket from the steering knuckle. The bolts that hold this on tend to get frozen, so you may need to employ a hammer, breaker bar, Liquid Wrench, or a torch to loosen them.)

, Some auto parts stores have brake lathes or a small machine shop. Call before starting your job to verify hours; most machine shops are only open until noon on Saturday and are closed on Sunday. Rotor/hub assemblies can be turned if they are not badly worn or damaged, but consider replacing them if they are grooved. The shop should refuse to turn them if they are thin or damaged.


The replacement parts may be expensive, especially if you're replacing the hub and its bearings instead of putting the old hub and bearings back on the car. Be aware that not all new rotor/hub assemblies include the bearings (although they may have new races in place, so that you can just ""drop in"" the new grease-packed bearings). You may have to install races and seals yourself, as well as pack them with grease. So a set of bearings may be a necessary purchase as well.
When applicable, this is also a good time to repack your front wheel bearings. Refer to your service manual or lubrication guide for this procedure. You'll need some new cotter pins and wheel bearing grease for this, as well as a pair of needle-nose pliers.

, New rotors have a layer of oil on them to prevent rust while they're on the shelf. Clean this off with carb/fuel-injector cleaner; it works better than brake cleaner in this case. Reattach the pad bracket. If you are not replacing calipers, skip to the step beginning: Clean the caliper slide pins below.

, Make sure the brake fluid reservoir is securely closed, especially if you opened it earlier to allow for fluid to expand. Remove the ""banjo"" bolt holding the brake hose to the caliper. This is a special hollow bolt that allows fluid to flow through it; don't damage it or lose it. Make a note of its position or orientation; you will need to install it on the new caliper in the same orientation to avoid bending and damaging the hose.

,, Make sure that the calipers are installed with the bleeder fittings/screws in the upper or top position. If you accidentally switch the left and right calipers and install them on the wrong side (easier to do than you think!), the bleeder fittings will be in a lower position, which will result in trapped air inside the caliper fluid chamber, which will make bleeding the brakes impossible to do. Remember, bleeder screws UP!


When replacing the calipers it is also advisable to replace the brake hoses to the caliper.

, Reusing the old washers, or failure to put the new ones in the right place will cause the brakes to leak. Tighten the bolt firmly.

, Use a wire buffer-wheel, brush or fine grit sandpaper, if you will be reusing them and any place where the pads slide against the caliper or pad bracket with a wire brush. Apply silicone brake lubricant to all of those slide locations.

, Yes, some caliper pistons (such as some Nissan) do actually screw in and out. If so, there will be notches for a tool to engage the top of the piston. Pressing that kind of piston in will strip the threads and ruin the calipers and pistons.


Using the large C-clamp: if this is the press-in kind of piston, take one of the old brake pads and place it in the caliper against the piston to place the C-clamp against. Usually a heavy duty 8"" to 10"" size (inner measurement) C-clamp will do, (lighter duty clamps will spring, bend or break). Slowly and evenly compress the piston back into the caliper.
An even easier way to compress this piston is use a special (but inexpensive and readily available) Lisle Corp Brake Pad Spreader tool (Lisle part #24400 $7.95) made specifically for this — it beats hauling a heavy 10"" iron C-clamp around — plus it's much faster to use!
Note: Prior to compressing the piston back into the caliper it's recommended you open the bleeder screw to allow the brake fluid to come out of the caliper while you compress the piston. This keeps the dirty fluid from going up through the brake line and possibly damaging the Master Cylinder and the internal parts of the ABS System if your car has ABS. This also eliminates the mess that may occur from brake fluid that will be forced into the master cylinder.

, Watch out for drips on the side where the reservoir is located. (See Note above) Be careful, brake fluid will damage or remove the paint from your vehicle if it is not cleaned off instantly!

, You may need to employ the large flat screwdriver again, but be very careful so you don't destroy any of the pad clips.

, On some brake calipers, blue Locktite needs to be applied to the bolts that hold the caliper to its mounting point."

Bleed the brakes.,
Use break cleaner to clean up any grease from fingers/skin and any break fluid that may have gotten onto the rotor or pads during installation.,
Put the wheels back on the car to hold the rotor on straight, if it is the easy removal kind of rotor (separate from the hub).

,
Do not let the car down from the jackstands yet.

,
Remove the rubber cap from the hollow bleeder screw, and unscrew the bleeder screw about 1/4 or 1/2 turn.,
Have your assistant slowly depress the brake pedal until it's at the floor and keep there until you tell them to let it back up.,
Repeat the process of pressing the peddle down, closing the screw, letting up, loosening, return to pressing the peddle down, etc... until you see clean brake fluid (without bubbles) coming out of the bleeder.,
Make sure the brake fluid reservoir does not run empty while bleeding the brakes.",How to Replace Disc Brakes4," If you have not replaced the calipers or loosened any fittings, you can SKIP to the next section. You may wish to bleed the brakes later if you determine that the brake peddle feels mushy or goes down too far.


You'll need a good helper for this, and do one side at a time.

, Grease and or fluid on the pads can keep your car's breaks from gripping properly and will make stopping harder.

,,, This should be just enough to loosen it, being careful not to damage the screw (use a snugly fitting solid wrench, not pliers and not an adjustable wrench). Attach an appropriate size clear or rubber hose to the bleeder screw with the other end immersed in brake fluid in a jar or can before depressing the brake pedal. This helps to avoid sucking air back into the bleeder screw if the pedal is let up at the wrong time.

, Some fluid may flow out or you may see bubbling from the tube in the jar while only air is coming out. While the pedal is at the floor, close the bleeder screw. Have your assistant slowly lift the pedal. While the brake pedal is all the way up, open the bleeder screw again.

, Always tighten the bleeder screw before letting up the peddle; final check that it is tightened securely when finished. (Some brakes are gravity-bleed, and fluid will just run out when you open the screw, and only require you to open the bleeder screw until you see clean fluid, without working the brake pedal, but the pedal pressing procedure works in all cases).

, If the fluid gets too low you'll be introducing air into the master-cylinder and brake system again and will have to bleed it all out, which is even more extensive than just clearing air out of the wheel-cylinders and hoses.

Put the wheels back on.,
Check the brake fluid level and fill as necessary.

,
Sit in the driver's seat and push slowly on the brake pedal a few times.,
Check for leaks at the brake hoses if you've replaced the calipers.

,
Lower the car and perform a ""mini"" test drive, with wheel blocks situated a little behind and in front of the vehicles front and rear tires to allow some short movements rolling back and forth to test the brakes.,
Retorque the lug nuts to be sure they are tight and put the hubcaps/wheel covers on.

",How to Replace Disc Brakes5," Tighten the lug nuts in a crossing patterning, opposing fashion so the wheel goes on straight. Example: If you have five lugs, tighten them across the wheel like drawing a star pattern with a pencil by criss-crossing back and forth.

,, The first time, the pedal may go down a ways, but the pedal should be high and firm after two or three times. This seats the pads against the rotors.

,, Otherwise you may find out the hard way that your brakes aren't working. During an actual test drive, make sure the car doesn't pull, that there are no funny scraping or clunking noises, and that the brakes are working correctly.

Eye protection like safety glasses or goggles will keep debris from falling or spraying into your eyes while you work. Choose eye protection that fits comfortably and won't interfere with your vision. Gloves are an optional addition to the safety gear required for this task.Gloves can protect your hands from sharp objects or pinches while working in the engine bay.
Eye protection is required for this project.;
, The easiest way to locate the fuel injectors for your specific vehicle is to refer to the service manual for that vehicle. Most applications have one fuel injector for each cylinder. They are usually located on the intake manifold and are connected to one another with a fuel rail.The fuel rail is a cylindrical rail that will run along the top of the intake manifold, and each fuel injector will be between the fuel rail and the intake manifold.
V style engines (V6, V8, V10) will have two fuel rails with half of the injectors on each side of the motor.

, Locate a thin piece of metal that’s at least a foot or so long. It should be made mostly of metal, but you could opt to use a screwdriver despite it having a plastic or rubber handle.Make sure the piece you choose is at least a foot long, but not more than two feet.
A long screwdriver or thin piece of rebar will work fine.

, You will be using the metal rod to transmit sound from the fuel injector to your ear without having to bring your face too close to a running engine. Set one end of the rod or screwdriver on the injector itself while holding it up with one hand.Make sure to hold the screwdriver or metal rod at an angle that will allow you to bring your ear to it.

, Lean your ear close to the end of the metal rod or screwdriver that is opposite the injector. As the engine runs, listen for an audible clicking sound given off by the injector. This sound indicates the injector being activated.Be extremely careful leaning your head into the engine bay, and ensure you keep your eyes open as you listen to the rod to prevent accidentally getting injured.
If you have long hair, tie it back tightly to prevent it from getting caught in any moving parts under the hood.

, Use the same method to check each fuel injector in your vehicle. If you find one that is not clicking, there is an issue with the injector or the electronic control that is transmitting to the injector.If you have an OBDII scanner and your vehicle’s check engine light is on, you can check to see if there have been any errors in the vehicle’s computer regarding that cylinder or injector.
Replacing this injector may solve the problem, but you may also need to have a diagnostic done of your vehicle’s electronic control unit and fuel system by a professional mechanic.

, To conduct this test, the vehicle's electrical system must be active without the engine actually running. Insert the key and turn it until the electrical system activates, but stop before you engage the engine's starter. This should activate all of the vehicle’s electronics like interior lighting and the radio.If you accidentally start the vehicle, simply turn it off and try again.
The vehicle’s battery is powering everything during this test, so you should turn off things like the headlights and stereo to converse power and ensure it has enough to start the vehicle again later.

, A test light looks like a screwdriver with a finely pointed end and a wire hanging out of the handle. When the wire from the handle and the pointed end come into contact with a completed and powered circuit, a lightbulb lights up inside the handle of the test light. The wire extending from the handle will have an alligator clip at the end. Attach that alligator clip to the negative terminal of the vehicle’s battery.You can identify the negative terminal on the battery by looking for the negative symbol (-) or the letters NEG.
Make sure the clip has a good metal on metal connection to make the test light work.

, Each fuel injector will have a metal clip plugged into it with two wires coming out of it. One of those two wires is a 12-volt constant that should be continuously receiving power from your vehicle’s electrical system. There should be a small portion of each wire exposed coming out of the plastic clip that connects to the injector.These wires are often grey and black, but can come in any number of colors.
They will be the only wires coming from each injector.

, Take the sharp end of the test light and press it firmly into the rubber coating around each wire until it penetrates into the metal wiring itself. One of the two wires should make the test light turn on when it comes into contact with the wire inside the protective coating. If the test light turns on with one wire, then the injector is receiving the necessary constant voltage.Make sure to wrap a piece of electric tape around any holes in the wiring’s protective coating that are big enough to see.
If neither wire makes the light turn on, then there is an issue with the power reaching the fuel injector, which will result in in failing to fire.
If the all of the wires that light up are a certain color, make note of which wires are the constants.

, Test each wire coming out of the fuel injectors in your vehicle. If you locate one injector with a power issue, that doesn’t mean others may not have the same problem. Once you identify an injector with a power issue, make a note of which one it was and continue to test the rest.Follow the wires on the injectors that fail to engage the test light to make sure there are no breaks in the wire that may prevent the electricity from reaching it.
Let your mechanic know that you were able to identify the injector with a power issue. It may require replacing the vehicle’s electronic control unit.

, Take the same test light that you used for the previous test, but this time connect the alligator clip to the positive terminal on the battery instead of the negative.You can identify the positive terminal by looking for the positive sign (+) on the battery or the letters POS.
Make sure the alligator clip has secure, metal on metal contact or the test light will fail to function.

, Have a friend start the engine. If the vehicle won’t currently run, have your friend attempt to turn it over as you test each injector. Make sure you do not have any clothing or body parts hanging into the engine bay as it starts or turns over.If the engine won’t start, remember that attempting to turn it over for too long can kill the battery and damage the starter. Only attempt to turn it over with the test light in place.

, Use the test light and check the opposite wire of the constants you identified in the previous test. Press the sharp end of the probe through the rubber coating firmly until it makes contact with the metal wire inside.Be careful not to press the probe all the way through the wire and out the other side.
Always cover holes in the wire’s protective coating with electric tape once you’re done.

, With the engine running at an idle, the test light should flicker dimly and as your helper applies throttle by pressing the gas pedal, the light should flicker more brightly. This light represents the signal being transmitted by the ECU to the injector to spray fuel. If the test light is failing to light up, the injector may be bad or there could be an issue with the electronic control unit for the vehicle.This issue could be caused by a failing ECU, or one of the injectors along the fuel rail may be faulty.
The electrical pulse is transmitted through each of the injectors to one another, so one faulty injector could cause issues in multiple injectors.

, With none of the injectors connected, the flickering pulse should transmit through all of the wires without any issue. Use the test light to confirm this on the wire for the last fuel injector clip (at the end of the fuel rail). Keep the test light connected as you reconnect each fuel injector one by one. As you connect each injector, the pulse intensity should remain the same. It shouldn’t change until you connect a faulty injector that creates too much resistance for the pulse to travel through easily. When the pulsing light dims as you connect one of the injectors, that injector is faulty and needs to be replaced.
You can purchase new fuel injectors for your vehicle at most auto parts stores.

Park the vehicle on a firm, level surface.,
Let the exhaust to cool.,
Jack up the vehicle.,
Inspect the exhaust piping for damage.,
Start the vehicle to help find leaks.,
Assess the damage and your options.",How to Silence Exhaust1," When repairing an exhaust leak, the first step is raising the vehicle to a height you can work on. It’s important that you work on a surface that can support that weight of the vehicle beneath the jack. You also need the surface to be level, as it’s extremely unsafe to jack up a car at an angle.Black top or concrete are the best surfaces to jack up a car on.
Never jack up a car on grass, dirt or gravel as it may cause the jack to topple over.;
, While driving, the exhaust piping in your vehicle can reach extremely high temperatures. It may take several hours for the piping to cool enough to he handled as you look around for a leak.The longer the engine was running before allowing it to cool, the longer it will take to be able to work on it the exhaust.
Touch the hood of your car. If it is still warm, the engine and exhaust are both still extremely hot.

, Slide a scissor or trolley jack below the vehicle at one of its designated jack points. With the jack in the correct space, jack up the car until it is high enough to safely work beneath it. Using jack stands is extremely important. Never work beneath a vehicle supported only by a jack.Once the vehicle is jacked up, place jack stands beneath the vehicle to support its weight.
If you are unsure where these jack points are, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual to help you locate them.

, If you believe you know where an exhaust leak may be coming from, examine that area closely for signs of damage. Otherwise, start at the front of the vehicle and work your way back. Look for signs of damage such as scrapes, rust, cracks or holes. Aside from normal damage, be on the lookout for rust. Rust is also a common cause of exhaust leaks. If rust penetrates through all the way through a pipe, it will result in a leak.In lower vehicles, exhaust leaks can be caused by the underside of the vehicle bottoming out on things like speed bumps or pot holes.
Other common causes of exhaust leaks are crushes, punctures and loose hardware.

, If you can’t find the source of the leak with a visual inspection, ask a friend to start the vehicle. Climb beneath the vehicle with it running to look for signs of smoke leaking out of the pipes..Be careful working under a vehicle that is running. Keep your hands away from any moving parts and do not wear loose fitting clothing.
Make sure the vehicle is in park (automatic transmissions) or is in neutral with the wheels chocked (standard transmissions) before your friend starts it.

, Some damage can easily be repaired at home, while other issues may be beyond your ability or skill set. Once you have identified the leak, consider your repair options. If the exhaust piping is covered in deep rust, that entire section of the exhaust may need to be replaced. Small scrapes or holes can be addressed with patches or an epoxy.Small leaks may be repaired using exhaust tape or repair epoxy.
Larger holes a patch in conjunction with an epoxy to seal the leak.

Find a gas can or another closed container to siphon the gas into.,
Find or purchase clear plastic tubing 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.,
Set the gas can on the ground near the opening for the car's gas tank.,
Feed both tubes into the tank.,
Use a rag to create a seal around the tubes.,
When ready, force air into the short tube.,
Monitor the flow of gas.",How to Siphon Gas1," Any standard gas canister of sufficient volume will suffice, provided the container is a closed one. Because gasoline fumes can be hazardous to your health and because you never want to risk spilling gasoline, it's usually unwise or even dangerous to transport gas in a bucket or other open container.;
, Siphoning involves sucking gas through a tube or hose into its new container. Clear tubing is desirable because it allows you to see the gasoline move through the tube, but, because this particular method doesn't carry any risk of gasoline getting in your mouth, opaque tubing will do in a pinch.


For this method, you'll want two lengths of tubing - one long enough to reach deep into the gas tank and another, shorter length of tubing that will reach just inside the tank. Either obtain two separate lengths of tubing or cut one length of tubing to make two smaller lengths - the effect is the same.

, Siphoning works because of gravity - once you get gas flowing through the tube, it will naturally continue flowing as long as you keep the tube lower than the level of gas in the tank. Because of this, it's usually convenient to just put your gas can or receptacle on the ground under the tank.

, Push the the longer length of tubing well into the gas tank (keeping the other end in your empty gas can). The end of this tubing needs to be fully submerged in the gasoline in the tank - since you can't see where the end of the tubing is, you can check by carefully (so as not to inhale fumes) blowing into the tube and listening for the sound of bubbles. Push the shorter length of tube just a few inches into the tank so that both tubes sit side-by-side.

, This method works by increasing air pressure in the tank to displace the gas through the longer length of tubing and into your receptacle. To create this high air pressure, it's important that no air be allowed to escape the tank. Grab a cheap rag or towel (one you won't mind getting dirty) and pack it around your tubes to create a tight seal. The rag should conform tightly around your tubes but shouldn't compress them and prevent the flow of air and gas.


If you're having trouble creating a tight seal, try soaking your rag in water and ringing it out, then packing it around your tubes. Wet rags generally create a tighter seal than dry ones.

, Ensure that the end of the longer length of tubing sits comfortably in your gas receptacle, then blow air into the shorter tube to increase the air pressure inside the tank. You may blow with your lungs (in which case, take care not to breathe in through the tube and inhale any fumes), but you may find greater success using a mechanical air pump. Forcing air through the short tube increases the pressure of the air above the gas in the tank, causing it to flow through the longer tube and into the gas can.


If you're having difficulty, make sure you have a tight seal around your tubes. It's essential to ensure that air can neither enter nor leave the gas tank except through the short length of tubing.

, As you blow into the gas tank, you should see gas move through the longer length of tubing and into your gas can (assuming you used clear tubing). Once gas is freely flowing from the tank into the can, you don't need to continue blowing - gravity will do the rest of the work. When you want to stop siphoning gas, cover the long tube with your thumb, raise it above the level of gas in the engine, and remove your thumb. Any remaining gas in the tube should flow back into the tank. Congratulations! You're finished. Remove your tubes and close the gas tank.


If the gas in the tube won't flow back into the tank when you want to stop siphoning, ensure that the short tube is free of obstruction and, if necessary, remove the seal around the tubes. Air needs to be able to escape the tank to make space for the gas flowing back in.

Determine what size patch is needed.,
Cut an aluminum patch that fits over the leak.,
Cover the area surrounding the leak with epoxy.,
Place the patch over the leak.,
Apply the epoxy over the patch.,
Secure a large patch in place with hose clamps.",How to Silence Exhaust2," Exhaust patch kits can be purchased from most auto parts stores, but in many cases you could also use a simple aluminum can. Scrub and clean the area around the leak, then determine what size patch you will need to be to cover the leak. Leave at least a half inch or so of extra material beyond the hole itself when cutting a can into the right size for a patch.You will likely need to have that component of the exhaust replaced if the patch required is longer than about three inches.
Read the directions on the patch kit you choose to ensure it can repair a leak like the one you’ve identified on your vehicle.

, Cut you aluminum can into the size and shape you’ll need to seal the leak, with an additional half inch or so on all sides. You can also wrap the can around the pipe by cutting it down the middle. For smaller leaks, you can simply cut a circle of aluminum that is a half inch larger in diameter than the hole.Gloves can protect your hands from being cut by the can while you work.
Wrapping the can or patch all the way around the pipe will provide the best seal.

, Mix the epoxy together and apply it to the leak and the area immediately surrounding it. Make sure to apply enough epoxy to create a seal for the patch, but don’t apply so much that the epoxy begins to drip into the exhaust piping.Apply the epoxy to an area surrounding the leak that is equal size to the patch you are applying.
If you are going to wrap the patch all the way around the pipe, apply most of the epoxy to the area around the leak and a lighter coat all the way around the pipe.

, Either place the small patch directly over the hole or wrap a large patch all the way around the pipe. If wrapping the patch around the pipe, make sure the middle of the patch is over the leak itself. The epoxy should hold the patch in place, but you may need to keep a hand on it until you have it secured.It’s okay if some of the epoxy squeezes out the sides of the patch when you apply it.
Make sure none of the leak extends beyond the sides of the patch.

, Apply the epoxy to the edges of the patch using the tube’s applicator or a wooden dowel. Coating the patch itself with epoxy can strengthen the seal and reduce the chances of the patch leaking. This will also help hold the patch in place as the epoxy dries while creating a more solid seal.Coat the perimeter of the patch with epoxy to prevent pinhole seals.
If you wrapped the entire pipe with a patch, you do not need to coat the entire patch.

, If you chose to wrap the patch all the way around the pipe, use two hose clamps to secure it in place. Place one hose clamp on either side of the leak on the pipe, then tighten the clamps onto the patch and the pipe using the appropriate hand tool.The hose clamps will help ensure a good seal on the patch.
You can use hose clamps over smaller patches as well, though you may only need one.

Purchase a quieter muffler.,
Spray the muffler clamps with a penetrating fluid.,
Use a wrench to loosen the nuts on the muffler clamps.,
Slide the exhaust and muffler apart.,
Pull the muffler off of the rubber mounts.,
Insert the new muffler hangers in the rubber muffler mounts.,
Apply exhaust sealant to the piping.,
Slide the exhaust together.,
Secure the exhaust with muffler clamps.",How to Silence Exhaust3," There are a number of mufflers available for purchase that are designed for different specific needs. Ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to help you find a muffler that will fit your specific year, make and model vehicle that also offers better sound absorption or dampening.You may also be able to find replacement mufflers at large retail outlets.
Some universal mufflers may fit your needs.

, Your muffler may have accumulated a good deal of rust due to its constant exposure to water and road grime. Spray a rust penetrator like WD-40 on the bolts and allow it to soak in for a few minutes. If the muffler is secured to the exhaust pipe using a flange, spray the bolts on the flange.You may need to use multiple applications of rust penetrator before you can loosen the bolts.
If the muffler is held in place with muffler clamps, spray the bolts on the clamps.

, With the rust broken loose thanks to the rust penetrator, find a socket or hand wrench of the appropriate size and loosen the nuts on the exhaust clamp. You will probably need to replace the clamp, so if the bolt breaks, it’s okay.You may not be able to reuse highly rusted muffler clamps.
If you need to replace a muffler clamp, you can purchase replacement ones at your local auto parts store.

, Once you have removed the exhaust clamp, respray the area where the muffler pipe meets the exhaust piping with rust penetrator. Allow the penetrator to sit for a few more minutes. You should then be able to pull the muffler toward the back of the car to slip the two pipes apart.You may have to cut the pipes apart if they’re rusted together too thoroughly.
If your muffler was welded in place, you will have to cut the pipes apart.

, The rubber muffler mounts will hold the muffler in place after it has been removed from the rest of the exhaust piping. The muffler hangs on the mounts with a piece of metal that extends through a rubber eyelet attached to the body of the vehicle. Pull the muffler back and away from the vehicle to pull the metal portion out of the eyelet.It will take a good amount of force to release the metal from the eyelet.
If you tear the rubber eyelet, you can purchase a replacement one at most auto parts stores.

, Insert the metal prong from the muffler through the rubber eyelet on the vehicle. The rubber will prevent the muffler from rattling or creating a vibrating noise inside the cabin of the vehicle once the muffler is completely installed.The rubber eyelet can stretch slightly to allow you to insert the muffler into the piping after you hang it.
Make sure to replace the rubber eyelet if you damaged it removing the old muffler.

, Spray down the piping before you insert the new muffler into the exhaust on your car. Spray on exhaust sealant establishes an air tight seal between the two pipes which will reduce the chances of an exhaust leak where the pipes connect.You may need to allow the exhaust sealant to sit for a few minutes before moving on.
Refer to the instructions on the exhaust sealant to know how long to let it cure.
You can purchase exhaust sealant at your local auto parts store.

, Slide the muffler piping or adaptor over the existing exhaust pipe. The muffler should rest directly below the rubber eyelet, so the eyelet hangs straight up and down. If the two pipes feel loose or can be wiggled, you will need an adaptor to match the correct size of piping.Most exhaust piping comes in two or two-and-a-half-inch diameters.
You will not be able to seal the wrong size pipe onto another pipe, even by overtightening the muffler clamps.

, Slide a muffler clamp over the area where one pipe overlaps the other with the muffler seated properly. Use a hand or socket wrench to tighten the clamp until it is not possible to move the pipes back and forth at all.A half inch drive socket wrench will provide you with the leverage you need to tighten it sufficiently.
Be sure you tighten the clamp over where the piping overlaps, otherwise you could crush the exhaust piping.

Buy or obtain a siphon pump.,
Place a gas can on the ground beneath the tank and run the tubing from the tank to the can.,
Pump when ready.,
When you near your desired stopping point, raise the end of the tubing (or the container itself) to stop the flow.,
Remove the siphon pump from the tank.",How to Siphon Gas2," If you'd prefer not to work with an improvised siphon, specialized siphon pumps are commercially available for as little as $10-$15. These pumps come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes - some are automatic, while others are hand-powered. However, the vast majority function similarly: a pump in the middle of a length of tubing creates suction which pulls liquid from one end of the tubing to the other.


These pumps allow you to safely and easily siphon gas without getting your hands dirty or risking exposure to gas fumes. As such, they're ideal choices for cautious-minded individuals.

, Like the other methods described in this article, suction only provides the initial force necessary to start the siphon. After gas begins flowing, gravity does the rest of the work. Because of this, it's crucial for the receptacles to be below the level of gas in the tank.


Note: siphon pumps have one designated end that liquid enters and another end from which liquid leaves. Ensure that the correct ends of the tubing are being used. If arranged backwards, the pump will simply push air into the gas tank.

, Because siphon pumps work in a wide variety of ways, the exact action you'll need to take here may vary. If you have a hand-operated pump, you may need to grab a plunger and push in and out or squeeze an inflatable bulb. If you have a mechanical pump, you may just need to flip a switch.


Most hand-operated pumps only require a few pumps to get liquid flowing - after this, gas should flow freely.
Automatic pumps may or may not need to be left on throughout the pumping process. Consult any instructions provided with your siphon pump for more information.

, Raising the end of the tubing to a level higher than that of the gas in the tank cause the flow of gas to reverse, so any residual gas in the pump should drain back into the engine. If using an automatic pump, you may need to turn it off at this point.

, When the tubing is free of excess gas, you may safely remove it from the gas tank. You are finished. Close the gas tank and seal the gas can, then safely disassemble and store your siphon pump.


Some siphon pumps need to be cleaned after use. Consult any provided instructions for more information - often, all that's necessary is to pump a mixture of soap and water through the device and let it air dry.

Understand the danger of gasoline poisoning.,
Obtain clear tubing that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter and a closed gas container.,
Feed one end of the tubing down into the vehicle's gas tank.,
Place the free end of the tubing in your mouth.,
Keep your fingers around the tubing near your mouth so you are ready to crimp it before gas enters your mouth.,
Suck on the tubing and watch the gas flow into the tube.,
Check for air bubbles in the tubing.,
Stick the end of the tubing into the gas can and release your crimp.,
Pull the tubing up out of the tank when you have nearly reached the desired amount of gas.,
Remove the tubing from the gas container once all of the gas has flowed out.",How to Siphon Gas3," Gasoline contains numerous chemical compounds called hydrocarbons which are poisonous to humans.Swallowing gasoline or breathing in its vapors can lead to numerous unpleasant (even potentially life-threatening) symptoms, including difficulty breathing, localized irritation, vision loss, stomach pain, vomiting (sometimes with blood), drowsiness, cognitive impairment, and many more. If attempting this method of siphoning, take every possible precaution to ensure you don't swallow any gasoline or breathe in any vapors.


If you've been exposed to gasoline in any way and begin to exhibit symptoms, call the emergency services or your local poison control central immediately.

, As with the method above, this method requires a length of tubing and a receptacle to contain the siphoned gas. As above, it's important to use a closed gas canister to prevent gas from being spilled or fumes from being inhaled. However, with this particular method, clear tubing is not merely recommended, but rather, crucial. Because ingesting gas is hazardous to your health, you need to be able to able to see the gas moving through the tube so that you can take the tube out of your mouth before gas reaches it.

, Set your gas can on the ground near the vehicle's gas tank. Feed one end of the tube into the tank deep enough that it sits below the surface of the gas into the tank. To tell whether the tube sits below the gas, blow air into the other end (taking care not to inhale fumes through the tube as you do so) and listen for the sound of bubbles.

, This method of gas siphoning works by using your mouth to create suction in the tube, which draws gas out of the tank. Once gas is flowing freely, gravity causes the siphon to continue sucking gas out of the tank. Care must be taken to ensure you don't swallow any gas or inhale any vapors. Once the tube is in your mouth, breathe only through your nose and pay close attention to the level of gas in the tube.

, Once you start sucking on the tube, gas may begin flowing quickly. Keep one hand ready to stop the flow of gas so that none gets in your mouth.

, To minimize (but by no means eliminate) the risk of gas vapor inhalation, try to suck with your mouth, rather than your lungs - as if you are drawing on a cigar, rather than a cigarette. When gas begins flowing through the tube, it can flow somewhat quickly, so be alert. When the gas is about six inches from your mouth, crimp the tubing tightly near the end and remove it from your mouth.

, Air bubbles are a common hindrance when siphoning gas, as they can impede proper flow, forcing you to suck harder, which is dangerous. If you see air bubbles in the tubing, release the crimp and drain the gas back into the car, then try again.


Try to position the tube so that you're sucking directly above the tank. According to some sources, air bubbles are more common when the tube runs to the side, rather than up and down.

, The gas should begin to flow into the gas can. From this point on, the power of gravity should continue pulling gasoline from the tank and into the can. Monitor the flow of gas to ensure that the can is filling at a steady pace.

, Doing this stops the flow of gas and allows the gas remaining in the tube to drain safely into your gas can. Account for the volume of gas remaining in the tube before pulling the tube out of the tank - you don't want to wait too long and risk an overflow.


Alternatively, simply cover the free end of the tubing and lift it higher than the level of gas in the tank. Gravity will cause the gas to flow back into the tank. You can even lift the gas can itself while the tube is still in it for the same effect.

, You've finished! Close your gas tank and seal your gas can to prevent the inhalation of fumes.

Park the vehicle on a level, firm surface.,
Allow the exhaust to cool.,
Jack up the vehicle.,
Inspect the exhaust piping.,
Start the vehicle to help locate leaks.,
Assess the extent and type of damage.",How to Patch an Exhaust Pipe1," In order to repair the exhaust leak, you will need to jack the vehicle up to locate it. When you jack up a portion of the car, the weight of that portion will be centralized into the relatively small space beneath the jack. It’s important that you choose a surface that can support that weight. You also need the surface to be level, as it’s extremely unsafe to jack up a car at an angle.Black top or concrete are acceptable surfaces to jack up a car.
Never jack up a car on grass, dirt or gravel as it may cause the jack to topple over.;
, The exhaust piping in your vehicle can reach extremely high temperatures while the engine is running. Allow the vehicle to cool for a few hours before attempting to work on the exhaust to avoid burning yourself.It may take a number of hours to allow the exhaust to cool enough to touch.
Touch the hood of your car. If it is still warm, the engine and exhaust are both still extremely hot.

, Slide a scissor or trolley jack below the vehicle at one of its designated jack points. If you are unsure where these jack points are, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual to help you locate them. With the jack in the correct space, jack up the car until it is high enough to safely work beneath it.Once the vehicle is jacked up, place jack stands beneath the vehicle to support its weight.
Never work beneath a vehicle supported only by a jack.

, From beneath the vehicle, inspect the exhaust piping starting at the front of the vehicle and working your way back. If you have an idea of where the leak may be, you can begin your inspection in that area. Look for signs of damage such as scrapes, rust, cracks or holes.In lower vehicles, exhaust leaks can be caused by the underside of the vehicle bottoming out on things like speed bumps or pot holes.
Rust is also a common cause of exhaust leaks. If rust penetrates through all the way through a pipe, it will result in a leak.
Cracks in the piping are another common cause of exhaust leaks.

, If you are unable to readily identify the source of the leak with a visual inspection, have a friend start the vehicle. From beneath the car or truck you should be able to spot the leak as puffs of exhaust smoke escapes from it.Be extremely careful working under a vehicle that is running. Keep your hands away from any moving parts.
Make sure the vehicle is in park (for automatic transmissions) or is in neutral with the wheels chocked (standard transmissions) before starting it.

, Depending on the type of damage you identify on your exhaust piping, your repair options may vary. If the exhaust piping is covered in extensive rust, that entire component of the exhaust may need to be replaced by a professional. Small scrapes or holes can be addressed without cutting out portions of the exhaust.Small holes may be repaired using exhaust tape or repair putty.
Larger holes will need a piece of aluminum in conjunction with an epoxy to seal.

"
"
Scrub the area surrounding the leak with a steel toothed brush.,
Use sandpaper to prepare the surface of the pipe.,
Wipe the surface down with acetone.,
Determine if the hole is small enough to be sealed without a patch.,
Wrap the exhaust tape around the pipe.,
Mix the epoxy together and apply it to the leak.",How to Patch an Exhaust Pipe2," Because the exhaust is located on the underside of the vehicle, it often gets caked with mud, dirt and rust. Once you locate the leak, use a steel toothed brush to scrub the area surrounding it. Most repairs will not stick or seal if done over dirt and grime.Scrub the entire portion of the pipe around the leak, including the top side if you can reach it.
Make sure to wear eye protection while scrubbing the area to prevent debris from getting in your eyes.

, Once you have scraped off most of the dirt and grime, take a piece of fine grit sandpaper and use it to scrub the portion of the pipe you need to repair. Sandpaper will remove the last bits of dirt as well as creating tiny micro abrasions in the metal to help the tape or epoxy adhere to it.If you are using exhaust tape, make sure to scrub the pipe all the way around with the sand paper.
Roughing up the surface of the metal will create a stronger bond for the patch.

, Once you have brushed and sanded the pipe around the leak, wipe the area down with acetone to clean it and help the exhaust epoxy bond to the metal. Acetone is the primary ingredient in nail polish remover, so using nail polish remover will work well for this purpose.Be very careful not to drip acetone into your eyes or mouth while wiping down the pipe with it.
You can purchase acetone in the cleaning chemicals section of many retail stores, or nail polish remover in the health and beauty sections.

, Small cracks or pinholes can be sealed using just epoxy or exhaust tape, but larger holes will need a patch. If the leak is a thin crack or small hole, you can proceed without purchasing or making a patch to help. If the hole is larger, you will need a patch as well as epoxy.Attempting to seal too large a hole without a patch can result in an imperfect seal or the exhaust leak resurfacing after a few hours of driving.

, If you are using exhaust repair tape, wrap it all the way around the pipe, covering the exhaust leak with at least two layers of tape. Make sure to wrap the tape around the pipe for a few inches to either side of the leak as well. Different kinds of exhaust repair tape will require different application methods, so be sure to read the instructions thoroughly before you begin.Some exhaust repair tape must be applied to warm pipes in order to establish a seal, so you may need to start the vehicle and let it run for a few minutes before applying.
Other forms of exhaust repair tape needs to be wet before applying.
You can purchase exhaust repair tape at most auto parts stores.

, If you are using epoxy to seal the leak, mix the two parts together using a wooden dowel. Once the two parts are mixed, it will begin to cure immediately, so apply it to the leak quickly. Dab the epoxy over the leak, then use the wooden dowel to spread it around the area. Leave a thick layer of epoxy over and around the leak.You may also choose to wrap the leak in exhaust repair tape after applying the epoxy.
Different types of epoxy have different curing rates, so read the instructions on the package to know how long to allow it to sit before driving the vehicle.

Determine the size of patch needed.,
Cut an aluminum patch to fit over the leak.,
Cover the area surrounding the leak with epoxy.,
Place the patch over the leak.,
Apply epoxy over the patch.,
Secure a large patch in place with hose clamps.",How to Patch an Exhaust Pipe3," You can purchase exhaust patch kits from your local auto parts store, but cutting up a piece of an aluminum can will actually do just as good as job at serving as a patch for a larger exhaust leak. After scrubbing and cleaning the area, determine how large the patch will need to be to cover the leak and leave at least a half inch or so of extra material beyond the hole itself.If the area that needs to be patched is larger than about three inches, that portion of the exhaust will likely need to be replaced.
If you purchase a patch kit, make sure to read the directions to assess the size of a leak the kit can fix.

, Use a pair of heavy duty scissors to cut your aluminum can into a patch large enough to cover the leak. You may also choose to wrap the can around the pipe. For smaller leaks, you can simply cut a circle of aluminum that is a half inch larger in diameter than the hole.You may want to wear gloves while cutting a can or aluminum patch to avoid being cut by sharp edges.
Wrapping the can or patch all the way around the pipe will provide the best seal.

, Just as you would seal a leak with epoxy, mix it together and apply it to the pipe around the leak. Make sure to apply enough epoxy to create a seal for the patch, but don’t apply so much that the epoxy begins to drip into the exhaust piping.Apply the epoxy to an area surrounding the leak that is equal size to the patch you are applying.
If you are going to wrap the patch all the way around the pipe, apply most of the epoxy to the area around the leak and a lighter coat all the way around the pipe.

, Either place the small patch directly over the hole or wrap a large patch all the way around the pipe. If wrapping the patch around the pipe, make sure the middle of the patch is over the leak itself.It’s okay if some of the epoxy squeezes out the sides of the patch when you apply it.
Make sure none of the leak extends beyond the sides of the patch.

, Use a wooden dowel to apply more epoxy to the edges of the patch. You may even choose to coat the patch itself with epoxy. This will help hold the patch in place as the epoxy dries while also creating a more solid seal to prevent any exhaust from leaking.Make sure to coat the perimeter of the patch with epoxy at the least to ensure there are no pinhole leaks.
If you wrapped the entire pipe with a patch, you do not need to coat the entire patch, but pay special attention to wear the patch meets on the opposite side of the pipe from the leak.

, If you wrapped the patch all the way around the pipe, use two hose clamps to secure it in place and ensure a tight seal. Place one hose clamp on either side of the leak on the pipe, then use a socket wrench or flat head screw driver to tighten the clamps into place over the patch.The hose clamps will help ensure a tight seal along with the patch and epoxy.
You may want to clip the excess ends off of the hose clamps once you are done.

Consider more advanced tests.",How to Replace a Catalytic Converter," Replacing your vehicle's catalytic converter isn't quite like replacing a tire — you'll need to raise the entire vehicle off of the ground, rather than just one corner. It's very important to find a level spot to do this maintenance on your car. If your car is not stable, you risk serious injury or death if your jacks fail.


If you have access to a professional-quality hydraulic lift and know how to safely use it, this is also an acceptable way to lift your car when replacing the catalytic converter.;
, If your vehicle hasn't had an opportunity to cool down after running, its exhaust system can still be quite hot. To reduce the risk of painful burns, give your vehicle a chance to adequately cool down before working on it. Depending on your vehicle's exhaust system, this will usually be a matter of just a few minutes.


To test the heat of the exhaust system, put on a pair of heavy mechanic's gloves and gently brush the exhaust tube with the back of your hand. If you can't feel any heat, you may cautiously repeat this test without the glove.

, Slide under the vehicle and locate the tubes of the exhaust system, which should run all the way to your vehicle's rear exhaust. The converter should not be terribly difficult to find — it will usually take the form of a rectangular or rounded ""box"" in the middle of your exhaust system. Some models can have a roughly cylindrical shape.Check to see whether the converter is bolted or welded to the rest of the exhaust system at its connection points. You may need to take it to an auto shop to have it repaired if it has already been replaced and welded back into position, rather than bolted. You can still replace a welded converter if you have access to a sawzall (or similar tool) and a welding machine and know how to safely use both, but these advanced tools are beyond the mastery of most amateur mechanics.

, Most modern catalytic converters are equipped with one or more oxygen sensors that monitor the efficiency of the car's exhaust system continuously. If your catalytic converter has an attached oxygen sensor, use an oxygen sensor socket and a ratchet wrench to disconnect it before proceeding.


When you're done, move the sensor out of your way so that it doesn't interfere with the rest of the process.

, Catalytic converters that are bolted in can sometimes have bolts that are rusted, partially-corroded, or ""jammed"" into their nuts. These bolts can be very tricky to remove, so loosen them up by applying a penetrating oil (available from most auto stores). Allow the oil to seep into the bolts and lubricate them for several minutes before attempting to remove them.

, Use an appropriately-sized wrench to begin loosening all of the bolts before you start removing them. Once all of the bolts are loosened (but still attached), remove the ""rear"" bolts (those closest to the open end of the vehicle's exhaust) before removing the ""front"" ones (those further away). Remove the converter when you're done. You may have to support the exhaust once the converter is removed.

, If your converter is welded into the rest of the exhaust system, rather than bolted in, the only way to remove it is to physically cut it out of the pipes it's connected to. Most mechanics will use a sawzall or similar tool for this purpose. Cut along (or near) the existing weld lines, then remove the converter after it's cut free.


If you finish and the converter won't seem to budge, you may want to use a hammer to knock it out of its place as long as you take care not to damage or rattle any other parts of the exhaust system (this can lead to harmful exhaust leaks down the road)., The instructions provided in this article are written for general cases of catalytic converter installation. Because the exact part needed and the installation process can vary from vehicle to vehicle, the steps you’ll need to replace your vehicle’s converter may be different than the ones here. When in doubt, always follow the instructions provided with your replacement part or consult the advice of a knowledgeable mechanic. Converters have a specific direction they should flow and have an arrow for direction of exhaust flow.

, Some converters, especially bolt-installed ones, will come with small, round gaskets that sit in the pipes connected to the converter to give the converter a snugger, more secure fit. If your replacement converter came with these gaskets, install them according to any provided instructions before proceeding.

, Next, hold the catalytic converter in the position where it will eventually be installed. Double check to make sure it is pointed in the right direction (there should be an arrow indicating this) and that the correct side is facing down.


Since it's tricky to work on the converter with one hand while you hold it in place with another, for the next few steps, it can be useful to enlist a willing friend to hold the converter in place while you work or use a stand to hold it up in place.

, If your vehicle's catalytic converter was bolted in and your replacement converter has bolt holes that match your exhaust system's, installation is usually a cinch. To start, re-insert your bolts and use your hands to manually tighten them. This makes it easier to get all of the bolts to align correctly because the looseness gives you a small degree of ""wiggle room"" to make minor adjustments as needed.

, Starting on the ""front"" end of the converter (the end further away from the vehicle's exhaust), tighten the bolts with a suitably-sized wrench. Proceed to the back end when you finish tightening the bolts on the front.


You'll want your bolts to be very tight. Most exhaust leaks are caused by loose bolts, so making sure your bolts are extra tight now can save you headaches in the future., If you need to weld your converter into place, the process is somewhat more involved. You'll need a professional-grade welding machine (such as a MIG welder) and the proper training and expertise required to use one safely (or a friend who has these things). Don't attempt to weld your converter back into place if you're not a competent welder — you could damage your vehicle or even hurt yourself.


Weld your converter into place by carefully joining it to the exhaust system pipes at either end. Be sure to create a secure, air-tight seal at each weld. If the pipes aren't wide enough, you may need to heat them up and flare them to make them fit. If your pipes don't quite reach one end of your converter, you may need to weld an additional extender pipe in. Sometimes you have to do a partial weld then lower the exhaust to finish the top part of the weld.
Be sure to allow your welds to cool to a safe temperature before proceeding.

, If you originally removed one or more oxygen sensors to access your converter, replace them now. As you do, check to make sure that the attached wiring is secure and is not frayed or damaged — this can lead to inaccurate readings and even false ""check engine"" lights.

, At this point, if you've done everything correctly, you're basically done. Take the opportunity to make sure one last time that the catalytic converter is connected correctly and there are no gaps or leaks at either of the connections or the oxygen sensor. If you bolted your converter in, make sure all of your bolts tight. If you welded it in, make sure your welds are sturdy and airtight.

, Once you've installed a new catalytic converter, one thing you'll want to do immediately is double-check to make sure there aren't any leaks in the exhaust system on either side of it. Depending on where it is, an exhaust leak can cause a variety of problems for your vehicle, including reduced fuel efficiency and long-term damage.There are several ways to find an exhaust leak. One is to simply be observant while you drive — if your car sounds louder than normal when it runs or seems to ""rumble"" more, you may have a leak.You can also check for leaks by jacking your car up, starting it in park, and carefully moving a lit candle along the length of the exhaust tubing. Leaks which are invisible to the eye should cause the flame to waver or blow out.

, One problem that can occur in faulty catalytic converters is that they can become ""backed up"" with soot, debris, and other exhaust byproducts or broken apart inside the converter. In this case, the engine's ability to rid itself of exhaust is hampered, which can cause a vehicle's fuel efficiency to plummet and can even cause the engine to stall in severe cases.Luckily, performing a backpressure test is simple — just screw a pressure gauge into the oxygen sensor's hole before the converter in the exhaust manifold in most vehicles. The pressure reading should be less than 1.25 psi when the vehicle's engine is running at 2,000 RPMs.The worse the congestion is, the higher the pressure reading can be. Very bad backpressure readings can approach 3 psi.

, If your car's converter is old and worn, one simple test can tell whether it needs to be replaced very quickly. Simply grab a rubber mallet (or similar tool) and give the converter a firm hit. If you hear any sort of rattling, your converter needs to be replaced — this indicates that the metallic catalyst within has begun to corrode and crumble.


However, if you don't hear a rattle, this doesn't necessarily mean that your converter works well. There may still be other problems with it. To be clear, this test can only tell you if you have a bad converter, not if you have a good one.

, Catalytic converters can be tricky parts — if you're in doubt about whether or not yours is functioning properly even after performing the tests above, don't hesitate to take it to a mechanic or specialist. These professionals will have access to the type of equipment that can be used to perform more advanced tests, like delta temperature tests, oxygen storage tests, and CO2 tests.


Most auto shops that offer smog testing will be able to perform these sorts of emissions tests.

Choose a location to park your vehicle that is completely flat and firm enough to support the weight of the vehicle on a jack and jack stands. Dirt, grass, or gravel are not acceptable surfaces for this project.


Look for a flat area to ensure the vehicle remains stable while being jacked up.
Blacktop or concrete are the preferred surfaces to park your vehicle on.;
, Before starting this project, disconnect the battery by loosening the nut holding the ground cable on the negative terminal using a hand or socket wrench. Slide the cable off of the terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery to ensure it can’t pop up and come into contact with either terminal on the battery.Disconnecting the battery will ensure the vehicle can’t be started while you work on it.
The negative terminal can be identified by looking for the letters “NEG” or the negative symbol (-) around the terminal.

, With the vehicle parked on level ground, place wheel chocks in front of both front wheels. Locate the designated jack points for the rear of your vehicle. If you are unsure where to find the designated jack points, refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance. Jack up the vehicle by turning the handle of a scissor jack or by lifting and lowering the jack handle.Once the vehicle is high enough to work beneath, place jack stands beneath the vehicle to support its weight.
Never work beneath a vehicle supported only by a jack.

, If your muffler is not welded in place, it will be secured using muffler clamps. Muffler clamps are usually “U” shaped with nuts tightened onto either end. Because the muffler is exposed to road grime and water, it may have accumulated a good deal of rust. Spray a rust penetrator like WD-40 on the bolts and allow it to soak for a few minutes. If the muffler is secured to the exhaust pipe using a flange, the process is the same.You may need to use multiple applications of rust penetrator before you can loosen the bolts.
You can purchase rust penetrator at most auto parts or large retail stores.

, With the rust broken loose thanks to the rust penetrator, find a socket or hand wrench of the appropriate size and loosen the nuts on the exhaust clamp. You will probably need to replace the clamp, so if the bolt breaks, it’s okay.If you intend to reuse the muffler clamp, you may want to spray it with more rust penetrator as you work it loose.
If you break the muffler clamp, you can purchase replacement clamps at your local auto parts store.

, With the exhaust clamp removed, respray the area where the muffler pipe meets the exhaust piping with rust penetrator and allow it to sit for a few more minutes. You should then be able to pull the muffler toward the back of the car to slip the two pipes apart.


If the pipes are too rusted together to come apart, you may have to cut the pipes apart.
If your muffler was welded in place, you will have to cut the pipes apart.

, Cutting through exhaust piping could free up debris stuck on the bottom of the car and expel metal shavings in the cutting process. As a result, eye protection is absolutely mandatory before moving forward. It is also highly recommended that you wear heavy duty gloves to protect your hands from the blades or sharp pieces of metal left remaining after you make your cut.


Goggle style eye protection is best for this type of job. They will prevent debris from falling into your eyes from above, below and on the sides.
Leather workman’s gloves can protect your hands from metal slivers and accidental cuts.

, If you have access to an exhaust cut off tool, it is the best option when removing a welded or rusted on muffler. An exhaust cut off tool goes all the way around the pipe and leaves a cleaner cut than most saws. Wrap the exhaust cutter around the pipe and move the handle back and forth until you cut through the pipe completely.


An exhaust cutting tool works in a more confined space that you can often reach with a hacksaw.
You can purchase an exhaust cutter at your local auto parts store.

, If you do not have access to an exhaust cutter, a simple hack saw will suffice to cut the muffler off of the exhaust pipe. If there is a rusted clamp still in place, cut into the pipe just past the clamp. If there is not, saw through the exhaust piping where it meets with the muffler piping.


Make sure to keep your eye protection on throughout this process, otherwise you could get a metal sliver in your eye.
Make sure to use a hack saw blade rated for steel. You should not need to use multiple blades to get through the exhaust piping.

, When using a hack saw, the cramped space may make it difficult to saw through the pipe without hitting anything else. Be extremely careful not to saw through any of the lines on the underside of your vehicle, as they may be for your fuel or brakes.


Attempt to move anything to the side that interferes with your clearance when sawing through the exhaust piping.
You may have to saw through a different portion and purchase more pipe to extend the reach of the new muffler if you can’t saw through the pipe without damaging other things.

, With the muffler no longer attached to the exhaust piping, the only thing holding it in place will be the rubber muffler mounts. The muffler will have a piece of metal extended through a rubber eyelet attached to the body of the vehicle. Pull the muffler out the back of the vehicle to pull the metal portion out of the eyelet.


The end of the piece of metal that goes through the eyelet has a larger diameter than the rest, so you will need to pull hard to get it out.
If you tear the rubber eyelet, you can purchase a replacement one at most auto parts stores.

, Take a look at the new muffler next to the old one. Ensure the metal that the muffler hangs from is in the same place and that there is enough piping extended out from the muffler to reach where you disconnected or cut off the previous one. Finally, check the diameter of the piping. The muffler should slide tightly onto the existing exhaust pipe. If it doesn’t, measure the inside and outside diameters of each pipe and purchase an adaptor at your local auto parts store.If the pipe from the muffler doesn’t reach the old pipe or fit, you will need to purchase piping or an adaptor from your local auto parts store.
If you use an extension pipe, secure it to the muffler’s pipe in the same manner you would secure the muffler pipe to the exhaust.

, Slide the metal hanger on the muffler into the rubber eyelet to support the weight of the muffler. The rubber will prevent the muffler from rattling or creating a vibrating noise inside the cabin of the vehicle once the muffler is completely installed.There should still be enough play in the rubber eyelet to allow you to move the muffler around as you secure it to the exhaust piping.
Make sure to replace the rubber eyelet if you damaged it removing the old muffler.

, Before sliding the new muffler pipe into place, spray it with an exhaust sealant. Spray on exhaust sealant will help establish an air tight seal between the two pipes and reduce the chances of an exhaust leak where the pipes connect.Depending on the brand, you may need to allow the exhaust sealant to sit for a few minutes before moving on.
Refer to the instructions on the exhaust sealant to know how long to let it cure.
You can purchase exhaust sealant at your local auto parts store.

, Slide the muffler piping or adaptor over the existing exhaust pipe. The muffler should rest directly below the rubber eyelet, so the eyelet hangs straight up and down. The pipes should fit together snugly. If the two pipes feel loose or can be wiggled, you will need an adaptor to match the correct size.Most exhaust piping comes in two or two-and-a-half-inch diameters.
You will not be able to seal the wrong size pipe onto another pipe, even if you overtighten the muffler clamps.

, With the piping seated properly, slide a muffler clamp over the area where one pipe overlaps the other. Use a hand or socket wrench to tighten the clamp until it is not possible to move the pipes back and forth at all.You may want to use a half inch drive wrench to tighten the clamps to ensure you have enough leverage to tighten it sufficiently.
Be sure you tighten the clamp over where the piping overlaps, otherwise you could crush the exhaust piping.

, Ensure vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions are in park and those with standard transmissions are in neutral with the front wheels securely chocked. Start the car and look beneath it at where the muffler and exhaust piping meet. An exhaust leak would likely be visible if there is one.If you are unsure about whether there may be a leak, ask a friend to press down on the gas pedal slightly to increase the RPMs of the engine. This will make leaks more apparent.
If you identify a leak, allow the piping to cool off and try to assess its cause. You may need to remove the muffler clamp and seat the two pipes together properly before re-tightening the clamp.

Vehicle maintenance can be a messy job, so you'll want to protect you hands from grease and grime before working on the vehicle. These gloves can also protect your hands in the event of an accident.;
, Loosen the lug nuts a little before lifting a wheel, if using a jack (the ground holds the wheels from turning while using your lug wrench). Block the other wheels to prevent the vehicle from rolling when lifting only one wheel, or only one end of the car, at a time. You may need to release the parking brake for the wheels you are servicing. Using hand tools and a hand-operated jack(s) works fine, but using a power impact wrench and/or a hydraulic car lift such as professionals use is easier. See wikiHow's guide on how to change a tire for more information on lifting a vehicle with a jack.


Jack only against a thick and sturdy metal part of the vehicle's undercarriage (if the jack presses into thin metal or a plastic molding, it could punch through, warp/bend or crack such surfaces).
Caution: Support the vehicle on heavy duty jack stands after lifted in case a jack were to slip (a hydraulic bottle jack or floor jack might lose pressure and lower unexpectedly). A scissor/accordion jack might bend or break under stress.
Danger: A jack or jack stand can amazingly easily be leaned over by pushing (including by hand) on the vehicle, and it can easily fall. You could move a car sideways on purpose by jacking up on side of the car with bottle jacks and pushing until the jacks lean and fall over.

, The components of the brake, including the rotor, are mounted behind the wheel itself, so, to access them, the wheel must be removed. To do so, simply unscrew the lug nuts and pull/lift the wheel off, exposing the hub, rotor, and calipers.


To keep track of the lug nuts (and later, other important nuts and bolts), many mechanics like to remove the vehicle's wheel cover/hub cap and use it as a sort of ""dish"" to contain these small parts. But be careful not to damage the hub cap on the ground.

, The brake calipers are usually held in place by one or two bolts that are threaded in from the rear of the caliper. To reach these bolts, you'll probably need a ratchet with an extension. The bolts may have standard hex heads, or they may be Allen-head/hex-key type bolts.


After the bolts and any spring clips holding the caliper in place have been removed, take the caliper off and hang it out of your way with cord or wire, taking care not to put tension on the brake hose. You may need to wedge and pry with a screwdriver or tap with a wood block and hammer to dislodge and remove the caliper from the rotor and caliper bracket.

Note that if you remove the caliper from the brake line, the brakes will begin to and leak fluid out and get air in the lines, and will need to be bled after the repairs to remove the air.

, In some vehicles, the brackets that the caliper was secured to can prevent removal of the rotor. If so, use a wrench or ratchet to unscrew this bracket's bolts and remove them. Then, remove the bracket itself. These bolts may have a thread lock cement on them and come out hard.

, Sometimes, this can be as simple as merely pulling it off. However, if the rotor hasn't been replaced in a long time, it may be stuck by corrosion, dirt and rust to the wheel hub and be difficult to remove. You may need to tap it with a hammer and a wooden block to loosen it. Holding a block of wood against the rotor and hitting the wood, do not strike the rotor directly. Penetrating oil is helpful for loosening the corrosion and rust


Also, some wheels will have rotor and hub assemblies where the axle bearing retaining nut and grease-packed bearings must be removed. These are in the center of the hub or knuckle on the axle or spindle. You may, for example, need to remove a metal dust cap, cotter pin or un-clinch a keyed flange and/or castle nut, and bearing to allow the rotor to be removed. Be careful to not get dirt in the bearing.
After the rotor is removed, clean the hub surface of any corrosion or debris so the new rotor can sit flush on the hub surface.

,, Use a special brake cleaner solvent and a clean dry cloth to wipe any type of residue off the new rotor. Oil, bearing grease, improper solvents or coatings may damage or impair the performance of the brake pads. Do not use or clean dirty brake pads if they are oily or greasy -- they must be replaced.

, Put your new rotor on over the wheel hub. You'll need to thread the wheel studs through the corresponding holes on the rotor. Push the rotor back into its place around the wheel hub.


At this point, depending on the exact construction of your wheel, you should replace the castle nut and/or cotter pin on the hub assembly. If you bent the previous cotter pin to remove it, you may need to replace it with a new one — these are very cheap.

, If you disassembled your vehicle's caliper mounting brackets to access the rotor, you'll need to replace them now. Re-align the brackets and secure them in place with the bolts you originally unscrewed. The bolts should have a thread locker put on them if was used in an earlier installation.

, Caution: Some caliper pistons actually screw in and this kind have grooves and notches in their top face to do so. Next, the caliper with pads and spring clips must be put back in its proper spot over the rotor. Unhook or untie the caliper from its out-of-the-way location, then carefully compress the caliper pistons with a C-clamp or a specialized tool called a caliper compressor. When the pistons are completely compressed, the caliper should fit over the rotor. Note that many vehicles may require the bleeder valves to be opened slightly to allow the pistons to compress back into the calipers since forcing brake fluid back through the lines can damage internal check valves or antilock brake mechanisms.

, Ensure the caliper slides are cleaned and lubed with caliper slide grease and has suitable brake pads, then place the caliper over the rotor in the position you originally found it in. Line up the bolt holes and reinstall the bolts you removed to take the caliper off of the rotor.

, Congratulations, you're nearly done. All that's left is to reinstall the wheel and lower the vehicle to the ground. Carefully lift the wheel back into its original place over the lug bolts. Screw the lug nuts back on over the wheel bolts.


Slowly and carefully lower the vehicle to the ground. If you're using a jack, remove it from under the vehicle and put it away. Don't forget to give the lug nuts an extra tightening when the wheel is on the ground.
Refill the brake fluid then pump up the brakes using quarter strokes to keep from bottoming out the master cylinder shaft till the brakes are hard. Recheck fluid level and top off as needed. Bleed the brakes if any of the brake lines were opened.

, It's a wise idea to ensure the new rotor is working properly before driving away. In a safe location, start the vehicle and allow it to roll forward. Pump the brakes a few times. Push down on the brake pedal and let it rise slowly. The brakes should function properly, with no loud squeaking or vibrations — the former is a sign of worn-out brake pads and the latter of a warped rotor. Do a normal road test and brakes should stop normally without any noises or pulsations.

, If you're not pressed for time, while you're replacing your rotor, you may want to complete some optional brake maintenance. This saves you the time and effort of having to repeat the process of lifting the vehicle, removing the wheel, etc. later. To check the condition of your brake pads, look for a small notch or groove — when this notch is worn down so that the face of the pad is smooth, it's time to replace your pads. To remove your old pads, simply slide them out of the caliper.


Note that some types of brake calipers hold the pads in place with a small retaining pin or spring, which will need to be removed before removing the pads themselves.

, The slide pins, which sit on the outer edges of the caliper, regulate the movement of the caliper. For smooth, proper brake functioning, it's important to ensure these pins are well-lubricated. Remove the slide pins with a properly-sized ratchet or wrench.


You may also need to remove a rubber boot on the slide pin to be able to remove the pin from the caliper.
Keep track of these pins — they will soon need to be cleaned and lubricated.

, To help prevent the common brake problems of noise and vibration during braking, use a film of sealant often provided with new pads on the pads before installing them. Though it may be obvious, it's important to be clear here — only lubricate the back, not the front of the brake pads.


Use only lubricants made especially for brake parts — other lubricants can degrade over time or damage the brakes.

, Install the new brake pads in the caliper. They should easily slide in, though, if your original brake pads were held in place with a retaining pin, you'll need to replace this at this point. Be sure to wipe away any excess lubricant from the pads.

, Over time, the caliper slide pins can accumulate dust and grime, preventing them from sliding easily. Clean the slide pins with a fresh rag, clearing away any debris, and lubricate them with a silicone-based brake lubricant.

, Finally, apply some lubricant to the brake pad plates. This will help them to move easily and decrease noise during braking.


Your brake maintenance is complete — your brakes should now function like a ""well-oiled machine."" You may now proceed to replace your rotor or reinstall the wheel.

Put your vehicle in park with the emergency brake up. Don't park on a steep slant like a hill. Although unlikely, rolling is always a concern with any sort of vehicular maintenance.
Since you'll be using soap or commercial wheel cleaners for this method, you won't want to park somewhere where your rinse water will run into a storm drain. Instead, try parking on your lawn — the grass will absorb the water and chemicals without polluting your area's water supply.;
,


Most modern hubcaps can be removed by prying them off with your fingers or a wide-tipped removal tool.However, some select types of hubcaps are secured by lug nuts or plastic screws. If you're unsure which type of hub caps you have, consult your owner's manual. Trying to pry off bolted-on lug nuts can break or crack them.
The hubcaps can (and should) be washed, rinsed and dried separately from the aluminum wheels. Don't forget to wash the insides of the hubcaps — brake dust also settles here.

,


The process of braking generates intense friction between the brake pad and the disc (or rotor). After heavy braking, this can cause the disc or other parts of the wheel to become quite hot. If you've just driven your vehicle, give your wheels a chance to cool off and prevent painful burns.
To determine whether or not your wheels are hot, carefully move the back of one hand toward the wheel once the hub caps are off. Back off and give your vehicle a few minutes to cool down if you feel any radiating heat.
Note that excessive heat after driving can be a sign of problems with your breaks.Consider having your brake pads examined if you notice major heat radiating off of the wheel.

,


It's important to note that there is some evidence that, over time, exposure to brake dust can contribute to a type of cancer called mesothelioma.However, the link is not yet well-understood and it is thought that the cancer-causing effects may be limited to asbestos-containing brake pads.
To be safe, you may want to consider wearing a basic surgeon's mask and protective gloves whenever you're working with brake dust. However, no matter which precautions you take (or do not take), a single exposure to brake dust is very unlikely to lead to cancer.

,


For a cheap, easy brake dust cleaner, try mixing soap and warm water. Squirt a teaspoon or so (about 20 milliliters) of dish detergent into a bucket and add warm water from the sink.
Briefly stir the mixture a few times with your hand or a stick before beginning.

,


Spray the aluminum wheels with water from a hose (not your soapy water) to loosen accumulated grit and grime. Removing this unwanted material now prevents it from scratching your wheels while you scrub.
For extra power, screw a hose attachment onto a hose and use the ""jet"" setting.

,


Next, grab a small hand brush. Dip it in your soapy water and start to scrub the wheel. The brake dust should come off fairly easily, but it may take some light pressure to remove built-up deposits. Be patient and take your time, being sure to scrub every inch of your wheels — don't forget the inside surfaces, which can be easy to see if you have open-spoked wheels.
The best brushes for this job are small, maneuverable automotive brushes with soft or medium-stiff bristles. Some auto stores sell ""wheel brushes"" specifically made for this task which look somewhat like toilet-cleaning brushes. A toothbrush or an infant bottle washer work well for those hard to reach areas of the wheel.
Don't use a stiff, harsh brush (like the steel-bristled kind you may use to clean your grill). These brushes can scratch and mar your wheels' aluminum finish.

,


One cleaning accessory you may want to consider to make your job easier is called a washing mitt. This looks like a rubber mitten with a brush attached to the fingers. Some vehicle maintenance experts claim these make it easier to clean in wheels' hard-to-reach cracks, while others prefer traditional brushes.
If you're looking to experiment, cleaning mitts are usually available for quite cheap at auto repair stores — usually not much more than $10 or so.,


When you've given your vehicle a good scrubbing, hit it with the hose to remove the dust and any soap suds.
Repeat for each wheel as you clean them. It's usually faster to scrub all of your vehicle's wheels, then rinse them, rather than scrubbing and rinsing each individually, because you don't spend as much time switching between the scrubbing tools and the hose.

,


After you rinse, you may notice that you missed a few spots on your wheels. If this is the case, simply scrub and rinse again until you're satisfied with your result!

,


Commercial wheel-cleaning fluids (usually sold for less than $10)work well for removing accumulated brake dust. However, before you buy a can of wheel cleaner, be sure to read the label — some cleaners are formulated only for wheels made of certain types of metal and can actually damage the finish if used incorrectly.
In a study, Consumer Reports found that Eagle One, Meguiars, and Mothers brand products were among the most effective at cleaning wheels. However, the same study noted that Zep Industrial Purple Cleaner & Degreaser (an all-purpose cleaner) worked even better.,


Spray your wheel cleaner onto the wheel (or apply as directed). Be sure to cover all areas of the wheel that you wish to clean.
Note that certain types of wheel-cleaning fluid will advise you to wear eye, mouth, and hand protection and not to breathe in the product's fumes. If you are unsure whether you are adequately protected, consult your product's label.

,


If you don't want to spend the money on wheel cleaning fluid or you simply can't find a product that's right for your vehicle's wheels, you may want to consider using oven cleaner. According to some amateur sources, oven cleaner is comparable to commercial cleaners in terms of its ability to remove built-up grime and brake dust from wheels.Note, however, that oven cleaner is not specifically designed to be used on metal wheels. Thus, it's possible that using oven cleaner may have negative effects on your wheels' finish, so use caution if you're especially concerned about your wheels' appearance.

,


Once you've applied your wheel cleaner, give it a few minutes to loosen the brake dust. The recommended waiting time may vary from product to product — consult your product's label for more information.

,


After the cleaner has soaked into your wheel, start to scrub it off. While you can do this with anything from an old rag to a toilet-cleaning brush, automotive wheel brushes typically work the best.
As noted above, you'll want a soft or medium-bristled brush for this job. Any stiffer and your brush may scratch or mar your wheels' finish.

,


Just as with the soap and water method above, you'll want to rinse your wheels with a hose after scrubbing them, taking care to remove any excess foam or suds. As noted above, don't let the rinse water drain into a storm drain, as wheel-cleaning chemicals can be harmful to local water supplies.
Rinsing may reveal spots on the wheels that you missed. If so, don't be afraid to apply a second coating, scrub, and rinse again.

,


Once you're happy with the way your wheels look, don't wait to dry them off. If you do, small water droplets may dry on them, giving them an unappealing, spotty appearance. You've just worked hard to get your wheels looking great, so don't forget this crucial step!
The best towels for this job are older, worn-out terry cloth towels or all-purpose cleaning wipes.You want a soft towel so that you don't leave swirl marks, but high-quality towels (like those made from microfiber) can be ruined by using them on wheels, even after they're clean.

,


A high-quality paste wax can help keep your wheels in tip-top shape by preventing brake dust from building up and causing pitting in the future. Before you replace your hubcaps, consider waxing your wheels — it doesn't take long and it's a good long-term investment.
For maximum protection, re-wax your wheels every six months as part of their regular maintenance.,


After you have finished washing, rinsing and drying the wheels, you're more or less done. Replace your vehicle's hub caps (which you may want to soak and clean separately) to finish this job.

Lower the cone down until it is centered over the tube's end.

,,

Cut or use a different piece of tubing if any are found.

Research the appropriate brake line fluid, fittings, and sizes for your vehicle in either the owner's manual or at a local auto shop.,
Purchase a new set of brake tubes, fittings, and flare nuts with rust-resistant alloy finish.,
Know that you can purchase pre-fabricated lines at most auto stores to save time and energy.,
Purchase or rent a double flaring tool kit.,
Purchase or borrow a tubing cutter.",How to Make Double Flare Brake Lines1," If you've never made brake lines before, you'll need to do some research to ensure you're installing the correct parts. Look in the owners manual, or bring the old brakes lines off your car and into an autoshop., Head to the local auto shop and grab the parts necessary for your overhaul. You should be using the old parts as a guideline for the lengths and sizes, as all cars will have slightly different specifications.

Don't forget to purchase the appropriate brake fluid as well. You'll need to fill it later.
Again, when in doubt, do some research. The internet is filled with specific advice for each make, model, and even year of the car.

, As long as you have the right sizes and fittings, you can buy brake lines that are already double flared. Make sure, however, that the pre-flared line will fit your car by comparing to the old lines., These devices are relatively inexpensive, and will quickly pay for themselves if you're flaring multiple lines. They come in three basic varieties:


Manual: The cheapest, most basic option (usually under $100), these are perfect for most non-professional mechanics and hobbyists. Can even be borrowed or rented from many auto stores.

Leverage Manual: Like manual, but require less time and force for each flair. If you restore vehicles frequently or want a complete overhaul of your lines, this may be worth the extra money. Usually several hundred dollars.

Hydraulic: Makes quick, even flares, but is likely overkill unless your making multiple flare lines a day or need to save time (like an auto-mechanic might). Can get very expensive., You need to make clean, quick cuts in the brake tubing or else your lines will be weak and prone to leaks. Tubing cutters clamp to the tube and then rotate around the tube with a small knife, slowly cutting in a circular motion instead of pushing down to cut, which could pinch the tubing. They are usually less than $30.

In a pinch, you can use a hacksaw. If so, however, use only light pressure, focusing on cutting side-to-side instead of up and down."
"
Place the cone over the end of the tubing and move it down until the cone is centered.,
Turn the advance screw several revolutions.,
Check the new flare for any imperfections such as splits.",How to Flare Brake Lines2,"

On a generating flare tool, the flare is formed in the air instead of in the recessed part of the bar.;
, Check the manual for the number of revolutions needed for the flare size you need.,

Cut or use different tubing if any imperfections are found.

"
"
Clamp your tubing into the flaring bar.,
Install the yoke and use it to advance the cone into the tube until a bell shape forms.",How to Flare Brake Lines3,"

Ensure the depth is equal to the edge of your tubing size insert.

,

Remove the insert and finish advancing the cone into the bell.
The bell shape of the tube forms the double thickness flare.

"
"
Cut the tubing to the required length with your tubing cutter.,
Chamfer the ends of the tubes that you'll be double-flaring.,
Slide the fitting onto the line, with the threading facing the side you just cut.,
Mount your flaring base in a vice.,
Slide the tube into the appropriate sized hole on the flaring base so that the chamfered end barely pokes out the top.,
Tighten the flaring base around the tube, starting with the screws closest to your brake tube.,
File down the top of the tube so that it is flush with the flaring tool.,
Use a reaming tool to clean out the inside edge.",How to Make Double Flare Brake Lines2," Use your old brake lines as guides, cutting each line ahead of time so that you can visualize how much extra tubing you have (or need to buy, if you're short)., ""Chamfering"" is simply creating a slope at the end. You want to use a file or a bench grinder to slant roughly 1/2"" of the end. It will look a bit like a pencil without the lead in the center., You want to install the fitting so that it can be screwed on over your flare. Make sure you add the fitting now, as it can be difficult to add later.

Most lines are flared on both ends, so make sure you add two fittings, pointing opposite directions, before beginning., The long free piece of the flaring tool should be clamped firmly into a table vice, keeping it in place as you put pressure down to flair the line. The actual flaring tool should hang over the edge of the table, as the brake lines need to drop down below the tool as you work.

You can do this free-handed if you don't have a vice, but it is much easier with one.

, This is the part you'll be flaring, but you don't need much exposed to make your connection. 1-2mm above the flaring base should be enough., Note how, in the video, the tube is in the far left hole of the flaring tool. Thus, the left-most screw is tightened first, keeping the tube in place, before the screw on the right is tightened.

These only need to be hand-tightened., You want a nice flat surface to create your connection. Make sure it has a nice flat top., Take a small reaming tool and insert it straight into the top of the line, rotating it with even pressure down into the tube. This will ream out the inside edge of the tube."
"
Adjust the height of the tube so it reaches the height of your flaring anvil.,
Drop a few drops of brake fluid into the line and on the top of the anvil.,
Insert the rod of the anvil into the brake tube.,
Grab the yoke, E-shaped flaring tool with an adjustable conical point in the center, and clamp it to the flaring base.,
Line up the flaring cone so that it press down squarely into the anvil.,
Tighten the flaring cone, boring into the anvil, until the anvil is flush with the base.,
Without moving the yoke, bore the flaring cone directly into your tube until it is flush.,
Spray down the finished lines with brake cleaner and compressed air to remove any metal shavings or dust.,
Remove the line from the flaring tool, then install the brake lines like normal.",How to Make Double Flare Brake Lines3," The anvil is round piece with a small rod sticking out the top. The bottom is made of two cylinders, a wide one on the bottom and a thinner one on top. You want the tubing to reach the height of this bottom section, as this is actually the height of your flair.

Set the anvil next to your tube, loosen the clamp, and raise the tube to the same height as the ""shoulders"" of the anvil.
Make sure the anvil is the same size as the tubing you're using. The hole the tube is in should be marked with measurement (ie, 3/16"") that needs to match the measurement found on the bottom of the anvil (3/16"").

, The only lubricating fluid you should use on a brake system is a brake fluid. Do not use motor oil. Put a few drips in the line, and a couple on top of the anvil. The top is the side with the rod poking out., Turn the anvil upside-down and thread the rod on top into the hole in the tube. I should sit comfortably in the tube., For now, just attach it loosely, so you can move it around still., You want to take your time lining this up, as this is how the line actually gets flared. Luckily, the point is made to fit snugly into the anvil. You want to make sure, however, that it is not diagonal, off-kilter, or otherwise misplaced.

Once you have the right angle, tighten the yoke down so that it cannot move.

, Just turn until the bottom of the anvil sits comfortably on the flat anvil base, then unscrew it and remove the anvil. This creates your first flare.

Don't use excessive force here, or you could damage the flare. Slow, even force is all you'll need.

, Simply remove the anvil and repeat the process, tightening the cone directly into your tube. Again, you want to stop when it is flush with the top of the flaring base. Also, you again don't want to use strong or excessive force. Slow and steady is perfect., This will ensure your entire braking system is working properly., This process is simple and easy. Keep flaring lines, or go ahead and use this one for your repair needs."

Turn the vehicle off and make sure that it's in park with the emergency brake on to minimize the danger of rolling.
Put on protective eyewear — goggles with a face guard or hard safety glasses work well.Gather your tools and materials before proceeding.;
,


Grab your tire iron and give each lug nut one turn or so in the counterclockwise direction. Do not remove the lug nuts yet — only loosen them.
If you wait until the vehicle is on a jack, it can be quite difficult to remove tight lug nuts. Loosening them before using a jack allows the ground to hold the wheel in place so that you can get enough leverage against the nuts to break their initial resistance.

,


Attach a jack to the vehicle near the brake drum to be removed. Pick a sturdy metal part of the vehicle's undercarriage for the jack — don't put it under any plastic molding or flimsy metal parts or it may damage them when the car is lifted.
Safely and gradually raise the vehicle with the jack. If you're unsure of how to do this, follow the instructions that came with the jack for attaching it and raising the vehicle. Alternatively, check out our guide on changing a tire for more information.
Use jack stands or sturdy wooden blocks to support your vehicle. Never use materials like cinder blocks which can break or compress under the weight of the vehicle with potentially deadly results.Place wheel chocks around the wheels to secure the vehicle as you raise it.

,


Use your tire iron to finish removing the loosened lug nuts from their bolts.
If necessary, remove the hubcap and use it as a convenient ""dish"" or ""plate"" to hold your lug nuts.
When all the lug nuts are off, pull the tire away from its mounting. If you haven't done this before, don't remove more than one wheel at once — it can be handy to use the other wheel as a reference when you're putting everything back together.

,


Locate the access hole on the outside of the brake drum.
Turn the brake drum so that the access hole is aligned with the drum's adjuster screw. The adjuster screw is large and slotted, and is located beneath just beneath the centerline that runs horizontally across the back of the drum.
Turn the adjuster screw counterclockwise until it comes to a halt. The shoes on the drum should come loose from the wheel.
Pull the drum off of the wheel. If the drum will not come off the wheel, unscrew the drum and pull it off (see below).

,


Use a screwdriver to remove the screws securing the brake drum to the wheel.
Draw the brake drum forcefully towards you.
Use a screwdriver and rubber mallet or a brake drum puller to take the drum off of the wheel if you are unable to remove the drum by unscrewing it and pulling it.

,


Slide the screwdriver beneath the flange of the drum.
Use the mallet to hammer against the top of the screwdriver's handle or the drum itself (lightly). Don't bring the mallet down with excessive force — you want to use it to pry the drum away from its mounting, not chisel away at it.

,


Place each of the brake drum puller's 3 hooks evenly around the brake drum's flange.
Ensure that the screw in the middle of the brake drum puller lies above the middle of the wheel hub.
Use a screwdriver to attach the brake drum puller's screw tightly. Tighten the screw until the brake drum puller is securely fastened around the brake drum. Do not over-tighten the screw on the brake drum puller.
Knock the back of the brake drum lightly with a hammer. Tap the hammer against the brake drum with an outward motion. The brake drum should come loose from the wheel.

,


Over time, brake drums can accumulate a good amount of grime and debris simply from their normal use. Once you have the brake drum off, take the opportunity to clean it of this debris if needed.
Sources differ on which types of cleaning solutions you should use. Some recommend only specially-formulated brake cleaner, while others say that you can usually get away with soap and water.,


Over time, the shoes which press against the inside of the drum can become worn (much like brake pads do for disc brakes). Check your manufacturer's specifications — if your brake shoes are thinner than recommended, take the opportunity to replace them.
Use a pair of pliers to pull back the shoes' return springs. Next, use a brake spring tool to remove the hold-down pins and springs. At this point, some brake shoes will be able to be removed. If not, you may need to use a screwdriver to disconnect the brake cable.,


Most drum brakes on cars and other common vehicles are hydraulically powered. If there is a leak in the hydraulic system, you may notice fluid inside the drum and on the brake shoes. Usually, this is accompanied by decreased brake performance.If necessary, replace the leaky wheel cylinder. Loosen the brake line connected to it, then loosen the bolts at the rear of the cylinder. Insert the new cylinder into its proper place, attach the brake fitting, then the brake line, then finally re-screw the bolts.,


As a common rule of thumb, if the car pulls to one side while braking and the brake caliper appears undamaged, you may have a leak in your brake line.To replace damaged brake lines,you'll first need to loosen and remove the old brake line at its fittings with a flare nut or wrench cap. Be sure to cap the line to prevent spilling any fluid if necessary. Then, cut a new length of brake line and mate it to the old line with brass connectors or simply install it directly into the old line's fittings.
As with other forms of brake maintenance, it's important to replace any lost fluid and bleed the brakes after completing your maintenance.

,


Since you have easy access to the inner parts of the wheel, you may want to take the opportunity to clean and repack the bearings. To begin, disassemble and remove the vehicle's hub assembly. Remove the bearing assembly's races (this usually means breaking them) before finally removing the bearings themselves.
Clean the bearings by putting them in a container with gasoline and shaking, then rinsing with water.Add plenty of fresh grease to the bearing by hand or with a bearing packing tool.

,


When you're done with your maintenance, carefully reassemble the wheel and replace the brake drum by performing the disassembly steps in reverse order.
If you replaced the wheel cylinder, make sure it's secured properly. Hold the brake shoes to the backing plate and re-attach the springs (pliers or vice grips are usually a must here).
Before replacing the adjuster, clean its threads with an anti-seize compound. Finally, replace the drum.,


Lift the tire back onto its mounts. Screw the lug nuts on most of the way, but don't attempt to tighten them all the way.
Lower the vehicle back to the ground. Finish tightening the lug nuts until they are firmly secured. To evenly distribute the stress across the wheel, tighten the nuts in a star-shaped sequence.

"
"
Park the vehicle on a level surface.,
Start with the front wheels by placing wheel hocks (they prevent the car from rolling backwards) behind the rear wheels.,
Apply pressure to the jack till it makes contact with the vehicle.,
Once the jack has made contact with the vehicle loosen the bolts that hold the wheel on.,
Continue jacking up the vehicle till the wheel is approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) off the ground.,
What is in front of you now is the brake rotor, brake caliper & bracket.,
Once the caliper is removed you must now remove the caliper bracket.,
Remove the rotor!,
Installation is the exact reversal of this procedure.",How to Install Brake Rotors," Remove the keys from the vehicle and make sure the gear selector is in PARK and set the parking brake (this locks the rear wheels which means you must work on the front wheels first), for a manual transmission the vehicle should be in 1st gear with the parking brake set.;
, Place a jack under the front of the vehicle on what ever side you choose to work on first. The jack should be placed either at the designated jack point or under the frame. If you choose to work on the driver's side wheel first place the jack behind that wheel.

, Be sure the jack is placed in a spot that it won't slip from, or damage the vehicle.

, DO NOT REMOVE THEM, just loosen them.

, Remove the bolts that hold on the wheel (lug nuts) and remove the wheel.

, The goal now is to remove the caliper. The caliper is held on by two bolts. The size of the bolts vary, in our reference vehicle the bolts are 6mm hex head bolts. Unscrew these bolts. The caliper can now be removed. Depending on the age of the vehicle you are working on it could take a fair bit of muscle to get the caliper off. I suggest wiggling it back and forth. There is pressure on the rotor from the pads which is what will cause the caliper to be tough to remove.

, Generally this will be held on by two bolts. Remove these bolts and the bracket can be removed.

, If your rotor is kept in place by a screw or clip, this must be removed first, then the rotor will come off. If it has been a while since the rotors have been replaced the old rotors may need some persuasion to come off. Hitting the rotor with a rubber hammer should do the trick.

, To make the installation of the caliper a little easier try using a C clamp to push back the piston in the caliper, this relieves the pressure and makes the fit over the rotor much easier.

Use a tire iron or the appropriate socket to loosen the lug nuts on the first rear wheel, then slide a jack beneath one of the vehicle’s rear designated jack points to lift the vehicle up.Always use jack stands when working on a jacked up vehicle.
Unscrew the lug nuts and remove the wheel.
Refer to your vehicle owner’s manual if you need assistance locating the designated jack points.;
, With the wheel removed, you will be able to see the outside of the brake drum directly behind where the wheel used to be. The center of the circular brake drum is a removable dust cap. Slide a flat head screw driver into the gap beneath the dust cap and pry it toward you to remove it.The dust cap may have rusted in place or could be stuck due to brake dust and road grime.
If the cap doesn’t come off easily, spray it with rust remover like WD40 and allow it to sit for a minute before trying again.

, Beneath the dust cover, you’ll find the axle bearing nut. This large nut is usually a 22 or 24 millimeter metric socket, or a 7/8” standard socket. Use a breaker bar or half inch drive ratchet to turn the nut counterclockwise in order to remove it.A traditional 3/8-inch drive socket wrench may not allow you to put enough pressure on the nut to break it loose.
Set the nut aside someplace safe for use when reinstalling the drum.

, With the axle nut removed, the drum will no longer be held in place, but may still be stuck on due to rust or grime. Twist the drum slightly as you remove it to break it free from any rust.The drum may be extremely difficult to remove.

, Rust removers like WD40 can help loosen the grip created by rust on your vehicle’s drums. Spray it around the outside circumference of the drum where it meets the vehicle and give it a few minutes to set in. Then attempt to remove the drum again. You may bang on the drum with a rubber mallet to help loosen it up.
Do not strike the drum with a hammer, as it may damage it.
If you are replacing the drum as well, it doesn’t matter if you damage it.

, The primary brake shoe springs are the large springs located beneath the drum once you remove it. Some vehicles will have one spring for each brake pad, while others may have two. All of the springs will need to be disconnected to relieve the tension and allow you to remove the pads.You may be able to remove the springs with your fingers, but it could pinch or injure you.
Try not to bend the springs out of shape, as you will reuse them when installing the new brake pads.

, Use the same needle nose pliers to remove the clips that hold the brake shoe in place. There should be two clips inside the brake system that need to be removed prior to removing the pads themselves.Make sure to set the clips aside someplace safe for reuse when installing the new brake pads.
If the clips are damaged, you can often purchase replacement ones at your local auto parts store.

, The parking brake cable will be much easier to remove after the spring tension has been relieved. In some applications, it may be easier to remove the parking brake cable after you’ve pulled the brake shoe set away from the backing plate.If you can’t determine how to remove the parking brake cable easily, refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle for further guidance.

, Grip the brake pads on either side and pull them directly toward you to separate them from the backing plate. The springs will come with the brake shoe set, but the parking brake cable should remain with the vehicle.Once the brake shoe set have been removed from the backing plate, you can begin replacing the pads.

, Lay out the new brake pad set on a table, then place the brake shoe set you just removed from the vehicle down on the table next to it. Be sure there are no other parts on the table that can get mixed up with the components as you transfer them from the old set to the new one.Compare the two sets of brake pads. Aside from the wear on the old ones, the two sets should be identical.

, Starting with the springs, remove the components on the brake shoe set you pulled from your vehicle and place them on the new brake pads until the new pads are ready to be installed back into the vehicle.The number of springs and hardware you transfer may vary from vehicle to vehicle.
Refer to the service manual specific to your vehicle for further guidance.

, The parking brake adjuster will need to be transferred along with the springs as you transfer the hardware from the old brake set to the new one. Push the adjuster wheel away from the pin as you install it onto the new brakes.You may also wind the threads inward to make the adjuster as short as possible before installing it if it does not have a pin.
The adjuster is designed to self-adjust for your parking brake once installed.

, Use a pair of pliers or dikes to pull the parking brake spring away from the end of the cable. This will leave the end of the cable exposed to make it easier to install it back onto the brake assembly.If you are doing this job yourself, you may want to use locking pliers to hold the spring back from the end to make it easier to install.

, Press the brake shoe set with the new brake pads up against the backing plate, then reinstall the brake shoe clips you removed previously to hold the brake set in place.Some drum brake sets will come with replacement clips in the event you damaged the old ones.

, Reconnect the brake springs you disconnected in order to remove the old brakes. Use a pair of pliers to ensure you don’t pinch or injure yourself in the process. If the springs become too bent or damaged in the process, they will have to be replaced.Be careful not to overstretch the ends of the spring. If you do, you may be able to bend it back into place using the pliers, but if not, they will need to be replaced.
You can purchase replacement springs at your local auto parts store.
Reconnect the parking brake cable as well.

, Remove the new drum from the packaging and compare it to the old drum to ensure they have the same diameter. Place the new drum over the brake shoe set and screw the axle nut on to hold it in place.A new drum is required to allow the brakes to seat properly onto the new braking surface.
Replace the dust cover, then mount the wheel back on the vehicle and repeat the process on the other wheel.

Check for loose parts.,

Resurface the rotors.,
Replace the rotors or drums.",How to Fix Noisy Brakes," Try wiggling the brake pad, calipers, and other brake components. They should not move with just your hands.Loose parts can vibrate, resulting in noise.;
,, Disc Brake Quiet is one brand. Apply a thin layer of the substance to the back of the brake pads (between the pad and the caliper assembly). This will create a thin cushion to dampen the vibration and thereby the sound. Give the paste plenty of time to dry before you assemble the brakes to make sure it hardens: two to three hours at least, overnight if you can. It will become sticky and change to a darker color when it is dry.


Heat from the sun or a hair dryer helps to dry the paste, but let it cool to room temperature before installing the pads.
Should you need to clean or remove the dampening paste, use a degreaser or brake cleaner.

, Many disc brakes include a wear indicator designed to make noise if the pad is worn past a certain point.With aftermarket pads, sometimes the sizes can vary and cause the top of the pad to sit just slightly higher than the rotor. This will result in the brake pad wearing unevenly, leaving a lip or kind of a shelf of brake pad that rides over the tip of the rotor. This causes the brake pad to ride the edge of the rotor, causing a rotational brake noise. If your brake pads still have plenty of life left in them, you can sand the lip of the pad down (make sure you wear a mask to protect your lungs) to get more life out of the existing pads and eliminate the noise.

, Try different materials, but remember that noise and effectiveness may be a trade-off. It is best to replace brake pads with a similar material. Check the service manual for your vehicle to see what the manufacturer recommends.


An organic pad (with or without asbestos) may be quieter, but may lack the performance and wear resistance of a semi-metallic or metallic pad. An organic pad may not tolerate heat as well, and may therefore be subject to more brake fade (reduction in braking effectiveness due to heat) than other pad materials.
A semi-metallic pad, which has metal particles and organic material, tends to have the best of both worlds in braking ability without too much noise. It increases the pad life and decreases brake fade over organics, but it may wear the rotors slightly more. It will also tolerate repeated, hard stopping better without wearing as much as the organic pad.
A ""metallic pad"" is just that. Different metals are used to provide the most friction against the rotor. It does a great job at stopping at repeated high speeds with minimum wear, but it will tend to make the most noise out of all the pads. Metallic pads will also cause the rotor to wear faster (grooves, ridges etc.), especially with stock rotors not designed for use with metal pads.
Look for lubricating materials built into brake pads. Brass, graphite, carbon, and other materials in the formula can help reduce noise.Because these materials are built into the brake pad itself, they will continue to lubricate rather than wearing off upon use.

, An irregular brake rotor or drum surface can cause the brake pad to jump and chatter in the brake assembly and caliper.


Check the surface smoothness visually against a comparator gauge or try writing on it with a ball point pen. If you don't get a smooth line, the rotor is either too greasy or too rough., If the rotor wear is not too deep, you may be able to have the rotors ground on a lathe to smooth the surface. Call around to find an auto shop that services brakes and has a rotor lathe. If you do find a shop, ask if they use round lathe bits to refinish as they produce smoother finishes. Additionally you should put a cross-hatch pattern on the newly cut surface using a rotor hone tool, it's similar to what your do with cylinders bores in an engine block.

, If the wear is excessive or if the entire rotor is warped or distorted, you may have to replace the rotors altogether. Brake systems may be carefully designed and ""tuned"" by the manufacturer to avoid noise, so it is best to choose as close a replacement as possible.You may also need new rotors if the sound is not a squeal, but a metallic grind. If the brake pads are too worn, the rotors may be damaged."

Find out about car tinting regulations in your state.,
Decide what type of window tint you want.,
Consider your options.",How to Tint a Car Side Window1," Most states have specific regulations on tinted windows, as dark-tinted front windows make it difficult for law enforcement to identify hit-and-run drivers, or to establish eye contact with suspects during traffic stops. To find out about car tinting regulations in your state, contact a local car tint installer or do an online search.





;
, There are all kinds of window film available nowadays - whether you want a specific shade or you're looking for a certain effect, such as metallic, reflective or maybe even mirrored.









, Before you decide to go ahead and apply a film tint yourself, consider the pros and cons of all your options. For example:











OEM tinted glass: OEM tinted glass is tinted within the glass, as part of the actual glass making process. It lasts throughout the entire life of the glass. OEM tinted glass usually has only a mild tint that is legal even in areas with the most stringent rules regarding tinting. Keep in mind that OEM tinted glass may be more expensive to replace in a collision. Coating tint: The coating tint method applies a special tinted solution to the existing glass, usually as a spray. This type of tint lasts much longer than film tinting, though there aren't many shops who do it for automotive glass because it requires removal of the window glass, if done correctly.Film tint: Film tinting is a very popular method for tinting car windows after they've been purchased. With this method, the window glass first needs to be specially treated, before a thin polymer film is carefully attached to the glass. This is probably the least expensive form of window tinting, and some installers believe that the film can even limit the possibility of the windows shattering upon collision. However, film tinting is not permanent and it will need to be replaced every five years or so to prevent cracking, peeling, and bubbling.Consider having your film tint applied by a professional installer if you have never applied film tint before. This way, you can avoid the appearance of bubbles or damage to the film.

Trim the film.,
Apply the application solution.,
Apply tint to window.",How to Tint a Car Side Window2," Clean your side windows thoroughly, inside and out, using window cleaning solution and a squeegee. You may need to clean them two to three times to remove all the dirt. It is important to clean the glass carefully otherwise it will cause air bubbles on the film.










Remember to clean the gasket holding the window in place.
Use a razor blade to scrape off any residue.

, Unroll the film onto the inside of the window, liner side up (The sticky side is the film and the silk side is the liner). Trim the film to the approximate size of the window using a razor knife. Do this with extreme caution.










Always cut the film leaving at least one extra inch on each side, to ensure the entire window will be covered.

, Position the film so that the straight bottom edge extends to 1 quarter inch below the top of the inside casket. Using the razor knife, trim the vertical edges of the film first. Then lower the window down to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) and trim the film to fit the shape of the top of the window.










Make sure to press the knife gently to avoid any damage of the glass.
Accuracy with the trimming may require multiple tries to get desired shape.

, Spray the inside of the window generously with application solution. Next, peel off the film liner and spray the exposed adhesive with application solution.









, Carefully position the window film onto the glass, adhesive side facing the glass. Slide the film into place, starting at the bottom and working towards the top. The window should still be rolled down slightly.










Use a squeegee to press the film onto the glass, working from the middle out.
Apply more and more pressure as you feel the film begin to grab the glass. Make sure there are no air bubbles.
Roll up the window and continue placing the film into position on the bottom part of the window. Slip the end of the film underneath the window gasket.
Push all the water and soap towards the edge of the window, and blot away using a squeegee wrapped in paper towel.

Smooth out the window with your hard edge, pushing all the water and air bubbles towards the edges.",How to Tint Car Windows," You need a clean environment to prevent dust and dirt from mixing with the tinting. Doing everything indoor is not a bad idea. But if you want to work outside, you should choose a clean and dry place.






;
, Remove any stickers inside of your car screen and clean off all the adhesives or any sticky things that can create problems with the film sticking on the windows. Remove all the obstructions inside the car that can restrict your process and get in your way. Finally, vacuum the interior to get rid of dust.








, Lower the window slightly so that you can get the top as well. Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water and spray or wipe it on the window, then use the blade to scrape away all the dirt and grime. Make sure you clean both sides of the window well, removing everything.









Never use Windex, or cleaner with ammonia in it. It will tint your windows purple when you're done.
Make sure you get all the edges and seals, and role the window up to get the bottom.
You're going to need almost a gallon of soapy water throughout this process. Prepare the water ahead of time to make working easier. A spray bottle is highly recommended.

, Wipe away the soapy water on both sides and dry off the edges as well. If you're using a spray bottle, refill it with more soapy water. A squeegee will help you get the window completely dry.









You will need a plenty of soapy water to ensure that the tint doesn't stick or rip.
Make sure you get underneath the seals in the interior of the car. Use your finger to get under the seal and remove dirt and dust.

, You'll need to move the window up and down as you work. For now, leave it up.








, Like a sticker, the tint has a layer that can be peeled off right before adhering it to the window. Make sure, as you work with the tint, that this side is facing you.








, The water will help the tinting temporarily adhere, but still make it slippery enough to slide around and put into place.








, Unroll your tinting so that it covers the entire window, with at least 2-3"" of extra tinting over the edges. The liner (the part that will later adhere to the window), should be facing you.









Make sure you do not remove the liner -- you're just sizing and pressing the tinting right now, now adhering it.

, You should have a few inches of extra tint in every direction, but you don't want to be maneuvering the entire roll of film while working. Use a precision knife or blade to cut a usable square of tinting film from the larger role.








, Once the tint is cut into a square, it should stick to the water on the outside of the window. You should then spray the tint itself so that the entire thing is covered in a thin layer of soapy water.








, Simply use the edges of the window to trace your knife across the tinting film. You want a perfectly shaped line to ensure the tint fits. When done, two of the edges should fit perfectly, and the rest should still be square.









As you cut, use the squeegee or your free hand to make sure the film is flush with the window.
When done, cut the excess film away and discard.

, You want to shift the film towards the edge you just cut. This ensures that you have enough tint to cover every edge of the window, including the part covered by the seal.








, Once you slice the right edge off, pull the tint partially back to the center, so that there is roughly 1/2"" of extra tinting film on either side of the window.








, This is the tint that will eventually go into the door, allowing you a better light seal. Slide it down and then use the squeegee to flatten it again. You'll be doing the same thing you just did with the right and left side on the top and bottom edges.








, Once the window is lowered, you can use this top edge of the window as your guide. Use the precision knife to cut right to the top of the window. When done, pull the tint back towards the center. You should have roughly 1/2"" of extra film on every side of the window.








, When cutting away, the corners may have bits and pieces of extra film in the corners. Use your knife to clean it all up.








, You may need to reapply water to make it stick. If so, remove the cut tint, spray some more soapy water, and reapply the film to the window.








, Get out all the air and water by working from the top downward. Smooth the entire film out on the outside of the window. As you push to the bottom, you'll see zig-zagging from the ""fingers"" of air still stuck in the film. This is a good sign. Keep pushing downward, then run the heat gun along the bottom of the window to make sure it is all dried out.









You can leave the tint stuck to the outside of the window now. You'll have to prep the inside window a bit more, so this is a good place to ensure that the tint stays dust free.

, You're going to go through a lot of soapy water in this process. You can use a hard edge to get in between the seal and the window for a better clean. When done, spray the whole window with soapy water.








, Window tint works just like a sticker. There is a removable layer that adheres to the tint and keeps the adhesive solid. You should, however, only peel off only the top half for now-- it makes it easier to work with.









Just gently work the tint between two fingers like you were snapping to get the adhesive layer off.

, You are now ready to adhere the tint to the window.








, The water makes the tint easy to slide around, so you can get the edge of the window perfectly lined up with the top edge of the tint. Your window should still be slightly down.








, Once the top edge is on the window, sneak the two sides into the seals to the right and left, using your fingers to get them roughly flush. With one hand, pull back the seal around the window, then use the other hand to push the film under the seal and onto the window.









Remember to keep everything doused in soapy water to make it easier to move around.

, Using your squeegee or hard-edge, slowly work the water out by pushing the water to the sides. Push the water out the top and sides, but don't push towards the bottom, where you have the rest of you liner waiting to be adhered.









You should keep a hand on the tint at all times to keep it from moving as you squeegee the water out.

, Don't skimp on the soapy water -- it is essential to prevent the tint from sticking.








, Make sure both the window and the tint are wet.








, Spray off the tint with soapy water again. This is tricky, but should be easy with a hard edge. Pull back the seal with your fingers, then use the hard edge to push the film down and onto the window.




, Work downward and outward whenever possible, spraying the tint with more soapy water to make sure you don't rip the liner. Keep squeegeeing the water out of the tinting so that it is smooth, as if it was just a part of the window.

These clips release many different ways (i.e. pull straight out, remove the middle first, push in from either side, etc.) but damaging them will mean that they have to be replaced. They can range from very cheap, to relatively expensive, and some of them are hard to find., The pinch-weld is an area at the front of the car where different metal components welded together. This provides structure and forms a frame for the windshield. In order to remove the windshield you must cut it away from the pinch-weld. This can be done from inside or outside the vehicle with a cold knife or razor.

, The urethane is a very strong, but flexible, polymer based adhesive.


If you choose to cut from the outside you might have a problem when the windshield has been placed too close to the pinch-weld. If there is less than 1/8” of urethane then the knife will not have room to drag properly. This causes the glass to break and make a mess.
Cutting the windshield out from the inside of the vehicle is the other option. You can use an extended handle razor knife and cut with a repeated dragging motion. Many installers also use power cutters which are faster but do more damage to the metal pinch-weld.

, This should be done with two people. Open the front door on either side of the car and reach one arm in to gently push the glass away from the pinch-weld. Get a hold of the glass from the outside of the car and lift it straight up off of the pinch-weld.

, Any contaminants on the pinch-weld will reduce adhesion of the urethane and the windshield.

, The pinch-weld usually has old urethane about ¼” thick more or less and it needs to be trimmed down to 3/16” or about 3 mm

, Any rusty areas or areas with loose/damaged urethane will need to be sanded back to bare metal to remove all rust.

, You will want to cover any areas that were not sanded, and protect the inside of your vehicle using tape and sheets of paper or plastic. This will prevent the primer from getting on anything other than bare metal.

, This will help with adhesion of the urethane, but also is necessary to prevent the metal from rusting in the future.Priming the metal will require to spray on three thin, even coats of primer. Do not try to put on one heavy coat.

, The purpose of the primer is to open the molecules of the frit band to accept the urethane molecules.

, If you do not have an electric caulking gun they can be purchased at your local hardware store. They range from about forty to three hundred and fifty dollars.


The best thing for the new urethane to adhere to is the old urethane. It must be clean and free from dirt, oil or other contaminants.
One problem installers have is wind blowing dust onto the pinch-weld before the urethane adhesive has been applied.
The job can be done without an electric gun but it is much more difficult to get a consistent bead, making leaks likely.

, Carefully align the top bottom and sides by sight. Set the windshield on top of the pinch-weld.


Some vehicles have mounting block for the bottom of the windshield to rest on, others do not.
Be careful not to touch the frit band because the oils and dirt from your skin can contaminate the activated glass and reduce adhesion to the urethane.
Some installers tape the windshield once it is in place. This holds it until the urethane dries.

, Driving before the urethane has set completely is very dangerous. Depending on the type of urethane used, it will take between 1 and 24 hours to set. Follow manufacturer’s instructions regarding safe drive away times., You will need a special windshield trim tool that you can slide under the windshield trim and remove it to access the clips. Once you have access to the clips, use the trim tool to carefully twist the clips loose., It may help to cut the gasket so that you can straighten it out as you pull. If any of the gasket remains stuck to the windshield you can clean it off with a glass scraper or razor. Just be careful not to damage the windshield in the process., Once you get this end secured into the groove that your old gasket was in, you can start working your way around the windshield slowly., Go around the perimeter of your windshield working the gasket into the groove and being careful not to miss a spot. The entire gasket should fit snugly into the groove., You want to put the windshield clips back into their original place and tighten them so that they hold the gasket and windshield securely., This trim covers your windshield windshield gasket and clips.

Buy replacement glass, either from a junk yard (there are a bunch out there) or an auto glass shop.,
Buy new rubber.,
Remove the old glass.",How to Replace VW Bus Windshields and Seals1,"


Most shops can get it for you new, though not all of the new glass fits as well as original windshields, and it tends to be much more expensive.;
, If you are going to put the effort in, it's best to replace the seal as well.


The ""Classic Cal"" look (all black) is a good way to go. Many people think think it looks better, plus you don't have to fool with inserting the chrome trim into the rubber - a serious pain.

, Use a utility knife to slice off the outer edge of the seal, running a thin blade between the glass and the seal. Pull out the glass and chuck the old seal. As you cut away the old seal make sure not to let the window fall out.


Use this step as well if you are removing the glass yourself at the junkyard. Use duct tape to hold the glass to the car body by running 2 vertical pieces of duct tapes to the roof and the center of the glass. Should the glass ""pop out"" when you cut the last old seal you will have time to catch it.

"
"
Inspect your frame.,
Clean both sides of the glass.

,
Put the seal on the window.,
Have patience - lots and lots of patience.,
Prepare the seal and window or windshield to go back on the bus.",How to Replace VW Bus Windshields and Seals2," Those rubber seals, especially if they are old and cracked, can trap water against the metal frame which leads to rust.


If the frame is seriously rusted, it is time for a trip to the body shop to get a new one cut in.
If there is light pitting, a sanding, filling, priming and painting is in order.
Make sure the surface, even if undamaged, is clean and smooth so the new rubber will seal well.

,, This is trickier than it sounds because the new rubber is a tight fit. Find a large flat work area and put down either a rubber mat or thick cloth to keep from scratching the glass while you are working.


Starting at one corner, begin sliding the glass into the inner groove of the seal (they make special tools to facilitate this, but a blunt screwdriver will work well if you are careful).
A second person here is helpful to hold the seal on the glass while you work.

, Remember, don't over torque the glass putting the seal in place. Doing so is a good way to end up buying more glass.


Work slowly and make sure the rubber is well seated on the glass.
Lubricating the glass with a little water mixed with dishwashing soap can make the rubber slide onto the glass more easily.

, Get some nylon rope a little thinner than a pencil and long enough to go all the way around the window with enough left over to hold on to - about 6 inches (15.2 cm) to a foot on either side.


Again, soapy water can help here: Starting at the bottom of the window and leaving some excess rope hanging out, begin inserting the rope into the groove in the rubber seal that will seat into the window frame on the bus.
Run the rope all the way around the window seal in the groove and leave the excess dangling from the bottom. Keep the whole mess in line with some electricians tape. It is less adhesive than duct tape and will be easier to remove when all is in position.

"
"
Lube the window frame with soapy water,and have someone outside the vehicle press the new glass and seal up against the frame with the bits of rope hanging on the inside of the bus.,
Inspect your work.,
Clean the glass and seal.,
Buy your helper dinner.,
Go clog the interstates with slow-moving air-cooled VWs.

",How to Replace VW Bus Windshields and Seals3,"


Line up the glass (This is especially important with bay window-style windshields, because the curved glass has to fit the frame just right.), then have the person outside the vehicle press the glass firmly into place. Set the bottom part of the seal in the frame first as it is the hardest part to get right.
The second person on the inside needs to grasp the rope and begin pulling inward. That should pull the inner lip of the rubber seal over the edge of the window frame and begin seating the window to the vehicle. As you pull the rope towards you inside the van, the window should suck into place. Use a silicone spray lube to soften and slip the seal into position
Make sure the person outside continues to apply firm pressure and keep everything lined up as the person on the inside pulls the rope towards them. Again, there are special tools that do the same thing, but rope works well and is just about free.
Have a thin putty knife without sharp edges on hand to help with any trouble spots or snags the rope may hit.

, Once the last of the rope is out and the window is in, make sure the seal is in place all the way around. Fix any areas that might have folded under with the putty knife by running it between the frame and the rubber.


Press the window firmly from the inside to make sure it is well seated, but make sure your helper is ready to catch it on the outside in the event you pop it all the way out.

, Maybe even treat it with rubber preservative so you won't have to do this again too soon.

, They earned it, and saved you a bunch of cash. A lot of glass places will charge upwards of $100 just for the labor (that's with you supplying the glass and seal).

Reinstall the plastic liner and interior panel.",How to Replace a Power Window Motor," Most interior door panels are held in place with plastic interior fasteners. You can remove these fasteners by pulling on them until they pop out of their holes. Interior panels may also be held on with metal or plastic screws or even bolts.If you can’t easily identify what kind of fasteners are on your door panel, refer to the vehicle’s service manual.
Turn screws or bolts counter clockwise to loosen them, then pull the panel backward off of the door.;
, Beneath the door panel you will find a thin, translucent layer of plastic. This cover protects the interior of the vehicle from any water that may splash into the door from above and below. Carefully pull the door off of the sticky portions that secure it.Try not to tear the cover as you will need to reinstall it after replacing the window motor.
Replacement covers can be purchased at your local auto parts store.

, Depending on the design of your door, there are a few different places the window mounting bolts may be, but it should be fairly apparent when looking into the door. Look for the bolts attaching the window itself to the mechanism that raises and lowers it.You may need to use a flashlight to look into the service ports on the door.
Different shaped doors will place the bolts in different locations.

, In some cases, you may need to raise or lower the window in order to access the bolts. Turn the key in the ignition of the vehicle without starting the engine to move the window if need be.Raise or lower the window using the power window buttons if possible.
If the motor is broken, you can force the window up or down by hand.

, Use the appropriate sized socket or open ended wrench to remove the window mounting bolts, but ask a friend to hold the window up as you do to prevent it from falling down once it’s disconnected.You may be able to hold the window in place as you loosen the bolts yourself, but it’s dangerous.
Dropping the window freely could result in the glass breaking.

, Have your friend raise the window up into the door frame as though you had rolled it up normally. Ask them to hold the window in place until you are able to secure it.Pressing one palm on each side of the glass will allow your friend to hold the window up.

, With your friend holding the window up, pull off three or four strips of masking tape that are each about a foot long. Stick the strips to the window on each side over the door frame to hold the window up while you work.Once the window is secured with the tape, you can have your friend let go.
Be sure the tape will hold the weight of the window before your friend releases it.

, The window regulator runs the width of the interior portion of the door and moves back and forth in order to raise and lower the window. Find the bolts that hold the regulator to the door and remove them with a socket or open ended wrench.Set the bolts aside someplace safe, where you will easily be able to determine which bolts were for the regulator.
Leave the regulator laying inside the door’s interior for now.

, The power window motor is much smaller than the regulator, but should be located close by. In most applications, the bolts securing the motor to the door are the same size as the regulator mounting bolts. Remove them and set them someplace safe as well.Even if the bolts have the same size head, they may not be the same length, so be sure to set them aside separately from the regulator mounting bolts.

, The power window controls attach to the motor and regulator via a wiring pigtail connector. Press the tab down to disconnect the pigtail then pull them apart to disconnect the motor.Be careful not to break the tab that holds the wiring harness together.
Pull the pigtail apart at the clip, not on the wires. Pulling on the wires could pull them out of the pigtail.

, With the pigtail disconnected, the power window motor and regulator will no longer be connected to anything inside the door. Reach into the large access port and pull them each out.The two are connected, so pulling one will remove them both.
Be careful not to damage the regulator if you are only replacing the motor.

, If you are only replacing the power window motor and not the regulator itself, you will need to disconnect it and connect it to your new power window motor. Visually inspect the two to make sure the new motor matches the old one, then swap the regulator.Different vehicles will use different methodology to secure the regulator to the window motor.
Refer to the service manual for your vehicle if you are unsure of how to disconnect the regulator.

, Insert the power window motor and regulator back into the main service port in the door in exactly the opposite order that you removed them in when disassembling the door.Orient each component so the holes for the mounting bolts will line up with the holes in the interior of the door.

, Hold each component in the appropriate position as you return the mounting bolts that secure both the power window motor and the regulator. Thread each bolt in by hand first, then use a wrench to tighten them.If a bolt doesn’t thread it properly, remove it and try again to prevent cross-threading them.
The bolts don’t have to be extremely tight, just tight enough to prevent them from vibrating loose as you drive.

, Once the power window motor and regulator are both mounted securely to the door, connect the wiring from the motor to the pigtail you disconnected previously. This will reconnect the power window switches and power source.Be sure the connections fit together. If not, you don’t have the correct power window motor.

, Ask your friend to hold the window again. Once they are in place, remove the masking tape that is holding the window up in the door frame. Once the tape is removed, your friend can lower the window back into the mounting bracket.Make sure your friend has a grip on the window before removing the tape that secures it.
You can use adhesive remover like Goo Gone on the window if the tape left any residue once you are done.

, Have your friend hold the window in the correct place so the holes in line up with the holes for the window mounting bolts. Once the window is in place, thread the window mounting bolts in by hand, before tightening them with the wrench.Be sure your friend holds the window in place until the mounting bolts are in place.
Have your friend let go gradually to ensure the bolts are holding the window properly.

, Once the window is mounted again, you can reattach the plastic interior cover, then reinstall the interior panel over the door. Insert the door mounting bolts or snaps to hold it in place.Once the door is reassembled, reconnect the battery.
Start the engine and test the window.

Don't just open all of the windows.,
Don't just open a window all of the way.,
Instead, just open both of the windows on one side an inch or two.,
Experiment with more complicated vehicles.",How to Set Car Window Openings for Extreme Vortex Cooling," When all of the windows are open, or the windows on both sides are open, the outside air rushes in more or less evenly from each side, pushes on the interior of the car and the air from the other side, and rushes out the same side leaving the interior not well cooled. This happens unstably, for loud, annoying, hair-tangling wind buffeting.


Large interruptions in the car's sleek sides increase air resistance and decrease mileage. Highway driving with windows open is said to use more gas than the air conditioner.
Dogs or children may escape.;
, With a place to go in, but nowhere to go out, or vice versa depending on whether it's a front or back window that's open, there will be a similar buffeting problem.

, This will set the air inside the whole car spinning as some rushes past and mixes in fresh air along one side removing the old, eventually warmed air. The small opening won't let in much road noise or even much light rain.


The vortex will be strongest on the side opposite the open windows. So, if the driver is too warm or trying to stay cool and alert, and the passenger wants to doze or keep hair styled, the windows on the ""passenger"" side should be open.

, Try opening two back windows on a long van, or a few, separated pairs of windows along a side of a school-type bus.

, Any obstruction of the channel may prevent the window from rising or falling properly. You should remove any objects such as pebbles or leaves before proceeding.

, This will help to remove any grease or dirt build up that might impede your window or prevent your gaskets from sealing properly.

Be very careful not to get any acetone on your car's paint or carpets. It's better to put a small amount on a cloth and wipe with the cloth than to pour the acetone directly on the gasket.

, You can do this using a rubber adhesive or glue. Be sure to trim any loose corners with a razor blade so that you get a good seal.

, This may be necessary if the original gasket has large tears or several small tears. Replacing the gasket is a fairly easy job.

Use a trim removal tool to slide in between the window and and the gasket.
Hook the tool underneath the gasket and pull up.
Once the old gasket is removed, install the new gasket by fitting it into the same place as the original and pushing down firmly.

A professional repair is more expensive than a DIY kit, but the result may be significantly less visible.


In Florida, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Massachusetts, comprehensive auto insurance will cover the entire cost of repair or replacement. If you are in another state or country, or if your auto insurance isn't comprehensive, you may need to pay some or all of it yourself.;
, Cracks or chips on the edge compromise the structure of the windshield. Even after repair, this damage could be a major safety concern.Have the windshield replaced instead.

, Damage directly in the driver's line of sight can interfere with driving even after repair. The most dangerous area is a 12 in (30 cm) wide stretch of glass centered in front of the steering wheel, and extending the height of the windshield wipers.Replacement is recommended if this area is damaged. You may decide to make the repair and judge the visibility afterward.


In this area, two points of damage within 4 inches (10 cm) of each other require replacement. This pattern of damage can create a blind spot for the driver, obscuring the line of sight from both eyes.

, With modern techniques, most cracks shorter than 6 inches (15 cm) can be repaired at home. For a crack up to 18 in (46 cm) long, consult a professional first and repair it yourself only if he thinks it is safe. Any longer crack requires a full windshield replacement.If there are two or more cracks, take the car in to an auto glass repair shop and ask if repair is possible. Three long cracks almost always require full replacement.

, Damage from impacts may or may not be repairable. This depends on their shape and size:Circular or semicircular ""bullseye"" cracks must be less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.
A ""star break,"" or point of impact with short cracks spreading outward, must have all cracks fit in a circle 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide.
Other shapes should fit within a 2 inch (5 cm) circle, not counting short cracks running outward.

, Windshields are made from two layers of glass, with a layer of plastic in between. If the crack extends past the outer layer and into the plastic or interior layer, replace the entire windshield.Windshields damaged from the inside are rare, and even a professional may be unsure how to evaluate it. For safety reasons, it's usually best to replace the windshield.

, You can buy a windshield repair kit at an auto parts store, department store, or online. Ideally, choose one with a ""bridge"" applicator that fastens to the glass using suction cups. These are more stable than a syringe applicator.The applicator should also include a vacuum system to remove the air from the crack as you go.


Almost all repair kits have similar components and work the same way. However, it's a good idea to read the instructions that come with the kit, to check for special requirements.

, You'll be filling the crack with resin that needs to be cured with ultraviolet light. If you can't wait for a sunny day, you'll need a UV lamp to finish the repair.


If you're parked in the sun, shade the windshield until you're ready to cure. This will let you proceed at a relaxed pace.

, Use a thin metal object to gently tap out small glass shards from impact points. Some kits come with a bullseye tapper than can be used for this purpose.


Wear gloves while handling broken glass.

, The windshield must be completely dry before you begin. If there is any dust in the cracks — and there usually is — clean it with a dust blower, or a small amount of acetone or lighter fluid.If the glass is wet, dry it with a hairdryer.

, Take a few minutes to become familiar with how the applicator works. There are many different models, but most are not difficult to figure out by following the instructions. Check for the following:


Identify the syringe or barrel where you load the resin, and the cap or O-ring to close it.
Find the dial or bolt used to adjust pressure, moving the applicator into or away from the windshield.
Check the instructions for how to operate the applicator. A syringe applicator has a simple piston, but some bridge applicators may have a unique mechanism., This is the step with the greatest risk of causing further damage to the windshield. Fortunately, this is only necessary if repairing a long crack that does not end in a circular or semicircular hole, or if filling a small ""star break"" with no piece of glass missing.To tap the hole, place a bullseye tapper (or a sturdy needle) on the star crack or the end of a crack. Tap it gently with the suction cup removal tool (or any hard object) until a small hole pops out.In some cases, you'll need to drill into the hole before tapping. For home repairs, never drill more than ¼ of the way through the glass. It may be wiser to hire a professional instead if you can't tap the hole without a drill.

, Most repair kits come with two types of resin. One is meant to fill cracks, and the other to fill chips. Load the applicator with the resin needed for your repairs, according to kit instructions. In most cases, you'll only need a few drops of resin.

, Cover the suction cups with a thick layer of lubricant, so they can glide across the windshield. Position the suction cups so the applicator tip is over the hole at the end of the crack. Tighten until it presses gently against the glass.


If your kit didn't come with lubricant, try petroleum jelly (Vaseline).
If you are using a syringe applicator with no suction cups, just hold it against the end of the crack.

, Move the applicator along the first 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of the crack. Apply resin according to your model's instructions. Typically, this involves drawing back air with a piston or other vacuum mechanism, then letting go to push the resin into the crack.Slide back and forth over the crack, making sure the resin is going in.


If the resin won't reach inside the crack, flex the glass gently with your thumb as you apply. This should only be necessary to get it started.

, Move the applicator over the length of the crack. Once you are sure the resin is entering the crack, you should be able to seal the crack in one slow movement.


Note that the crack will still be visible at this point.

, Load the applicator with pit fill, or whichever type of resin your kit includes for filling dents. If using a bridge applicator, lightly lubricate the suction cups so they stick firmly to the glass. Position the applicator tip over the chip, and use the vacuum/pressure system until the resin fills the dent completely.


Syringe applicator kits usually come with a separate suction cup to be placed over the dent, with a hole for the syringe to slot into.Remember, star-shaped breaks with no glass missing need to have a bullseye crack tapped out first.
Clean out the applicator first if it contains a different type of resin.

, This is also called curing strips or curing tabs when sold in different sizes. This holds the resin in place during curing, preventing it from oozing back out of the crack or pit.


You may need a suction cup removal tool or a razor blade to remove the applicator.
Never use plastic wrap or other substances not specifically meant for this purpose. Some of these block UV light, and therefore stall the curing process indefinitely., Leave the repaired areas in full sunlight or under an ultraviolet light until cured. This can take anywhere from 30 to 120 minutes, depending on the brand and the strength of the ultraviolet lamp or sunlight conditions. Check the instructions for your product, and err on the side of a longer wait time.


Driving or opening car doors before the resin is fully cured increases the chance of lengthening cracks.

, Remove the curing strips. Scrape the resin along the windshield surface using a razor blade. Remove excess resin until the windshield is smooth. If the windshield is blurry or the crack is still visible enough to interfere with driving, you may need to cure it again with a special refinishing resin. Wipe clean with a glass cleaner once you're done.Fit the razor blade in a sturdy razor blade holder to prevent injury.

, Prop something such as a small empty box between the front edge of the top and the upper edge of the windshield frame so that the top stays open slightly.

, If dirt has accumulated in the pocket that has been exposed to the weather you may wish to vacuum out any large particles.

, If a large part is mostly separated you may wish to separate it entirely to re-seal it as one continuous piece.

,, At least in the case of cotton canvas, this will probably be not as far up onto the glass as originally (or as on a still-attached inside layer) because it will have shrunk since new.

,,, It should have just a little slack, since it needs to be pulled basically smooth but not taut when the top is closed. Just a little slack when the top is closed is much better than tension, which will unstick the tape.

, The reason to work outward from a central point is so that any ""excess"" material does not build up at one side.

Find a clothes steamer or similar tool.,
Heat one corner of the tint.,
Peel the corner with a fingernail.,
Slowly heat and peel the tint.,
Clean up the window.",How to Remove Car Tint1," Careful use of steam can remove the tint in one piece, instead of separating it into layers. Some professional mechanics use a clothes steamer, which you can find for a fairly cheap price at a department store. You can try using a clothes iron on steam setting instead. If you only have a heat gun or a hair dryer, using the ""household objects"" method below is recommended instead.


A few modern, metal-based tints cannot be removed by steam. Use the methods below instead if this doesn't work out.;
, Use the steamer to heat the inside surface of the window in one corner of the tint, for at least thirty seconds. Note that most windows are surrounded by a black band and dotted outline, which are not part of the tint. (These are both ""frit,"" or a baked ceramic glass that protects the adhesive between the glass and the car frame.)


Steamers and clothes irons typically need a few seconds to heat up before you can start steaming.

, Work the corner you were heating with your fingernail. If it doesn't come off, apply heat for another thirty to sixty seconds and try again. Stop immediately and reheat if the tint separates and leaves a layer of tint on the glass.


You can make a small cut with a razor blade as a last resort, but avoid scratching the surrounding frit. If the tint can't be lifted even after cutting, your tint may not be steam-removable. Try one of the methods below instead.

, Steam or heat the tint next to the corner you just detached, for at least a few seconds. Gently pull the tint a short distance, peeling off the heated area. Repeat slowly and methodically with each new section of tint. This may take a while, but don't be tempted to speed up. If you pull too fast or before heating, the tint can tear or separate into layers, making it much more difficult to remove.

, Once the tint has peeled off in one piece, use window cleaner and a clean cloth to wipe off any adhesive remaining on the window.


If the tint tore and left small pieces on the window, heat it and peel it off using the same method. If the piece is nowhere near the rear window defroster lines, you can wet the area with soapy water and scrape it off with a razor blade instead.
If the tint separated, removing one layer of tint but leaving a second on the window, you can try to repeat this method, but may need to take the car to a professional.

, You'll need to be able to work on an even and well-lit surface, with enough room to position your hoist and maneuver around. If you've got a big enough garage, all the better.


It's a good idea to take close-up pictures of as many components in the engine as possible, from different angles. As you get to working, these can be invaluable. You might even print them out and label them for a reference.

, Having tubs to hold bolts, clamps, and fasteners to sort these, a workbench or table to lay out tools on, and a parts soaking and cleaning bucket will make handling these items easier.

, Mark the hinge bolts so you'll be able to find them later. Loosening them carefully, have a helper assist as you slide it off and store it while you complete the job. Note that some hoods have electrical connections for an underhood courtesy light or for headlamps, signal lights, and fog lights that are mounted on it. These should also be disconnected.

, It's important to disconnect the ground cable on the battery before you do anything else, then start draining the coolant and radiator hoses to do the job safely. Be very careful not to damage the metal clamps, which are more difficult to replace than the rubber hoses, which you might have to cut or break.Remove the radiator and fan shroud (if applicable). Be gentle with it, the aluminum cells are delicate, and can easily be damaged.
Next, loosen the alternator, the tension assembly, cooling fan(s), and belts. Disconnect the intake air supply and the fuel lines. Some vehicles have a fuel system which is pressurized even when the engine is not running, so be prepared to drain the fuel and relieve the pressure before disconnecting them. When you unbolt the power steering pump and air conditioning compressor, do it without disconnecting the hoses to save yourself some time in reassembly.
It's a good idea to make drawings and take close photos, as well as labeling the hoses and wires with tape and marker. Do not depend on memory. Some wires and hoses will only plug into place in one way, but some are not obvious. You'll likely still need a chart, diagram/drawing, and pictures to ease the reassembly process.

, You can leave the spark plug wires for later, but start disconnecting the exhaust manifold and unbolt all visible electric connections to the transmission in preparation of disconnecting the transmission.

, Jack up the car and put it on jack stands, then support the transmission from underneath with other jack stands. It's very important to use jack stands, or some other support under the transmission before you disconnect the bolts. Once you loosen them, there won't be anything supporting the transmission and it will fall unless it's being held up by something. For vehicles with an intermediate cross member, this won't be an issue.


In most cases, the transmission itself doesn't need to be removed from the vehicle, as long as it can be safely supported when the engine is removed.

, Connect the hoist to the lifting points on the cylinder heads, or the biggest bolts near the top of the engine and adjust the leveler slowly to start lifting the front.


Be extremely careful. Swing motor free of car to avoid hitting the car and lower the engine onto your work surface, or the ground to start disassembly and inspection.

, No overview could offer all the specifics necessary to rebuild every kind of engine, making it essential that you refer to the manufacturer's instructions for every make and model. Get a hold of one, read it, and keep it on hand.


Even if you've got an older model, shop manuals are on eBay all the time for relatively cheap, and are often available at the public library for free. If you're going to invest in the project, it's absolutely essential that you get the shop manual so that you can learn the proper specs and particularities of the engine you're dealing with.

, Inspect fluid sweeping out of the many plugs, sending unit connections, and joints between components. Inspect the Harmonic balancer for signs that the isolation rubber is cracking, which may suggest it needs to be replaced. Check for any signs of overheating, cracking and scorching on the block. Also check for any excessive gasket sealer left behind from previous work.


Also, check the ID and casting numbers to ensure that the engine you think you are working on is actually the engine you are working on. Engine swaps are not uncommon and each engine has different specifications.

, Inspect the distributor for signs of looseness by putting some pressure on it. Inspect the alternator belt for signs of wear by spinning the pulley and listening for any unusual noise. Inspect the clutch assembly for wear.

, The exhaust manifold bolts or studs may be very corroded, take care to break them loose without damaging them. Using special lubricants for this may help, and extremely stubborn bolts may require heat to loosen.

, Start by removing the oil pan and the valve covers, then the cylinder heads. Be sure to protect the lifter rods when lifting the cylinder head(s), if they are bent or damaged, they will need to be replaced.

, You may want to use a micrometer to determine the bore diameter, very worn cylinders may be too far gone to allow a successful rebuild. If you know the engine hasn't been rebuilt previously, you can get a good idea of the wear to the cylinder walls by looking at the cylinder ridge. This is the point where the piston rings top out, the surface below the ridge is worn down the contact of the cylinder rings as they travel up and down, the tops isn't worn, so it indicates the original bore diameter. Generally, if the wear is less than 20/1000 of an inch, the original pistons can be reused, over 20/1000s will require the engine to be bored and oversized pistons to be used.

, The ridge is the point where metal of the cylinder did not wear because the rings do not rise that high in the bore. The cylinder wear should be below this point, but the ridge must be reamed out before removal to allow pistons to be removed and without damage and to make re-installation of the pistons with new rings possible.

, After removing the rod caps from the rods, place rod journal protectors (protective covers) on the rod ends and protect bolts to prevent them from striking, scraping and scoring the engine block or from bolt threads being damaged during removal and handling. Rubber fuel hose can be cut to slip over the bolt threads in this case. Once removed replace the same rod cap back on the matching rod, keep them as numbered paired/matched sets. Keep the parts marked or in order for return to the same cylinder from which they were removed. This to assure balance and fit; and consistent ""break"" in.

, Once removed store in a safe place, preferably use crank mounting plates so that you can accurately measure the crankshaft. Keep old main bearings in order, inspect them for wear and excess dirt. With the crank removed and stored correctly place the main caps back on the engine block and torque to specification.


Remove the camshaft, balancer shafts, and auxiliary drives. Pay attention to end play shims and spacers, keep these organized you will need to put these back in the correct order. Remove the cam bearings, paying attention to their position.

, Inspect for cracks and any signs of overheating. Measure different crankshaft dimensions. These dimensions include journal diameter, out of round, taper, and run out. Compare this to the dimensions listed in the shop manual.


If the crank is out of spec, mark it for identification and have it sent to a machine shop you trust with the necessary machinery for resurfacing or turning to return the bearing journals to round. If the crank is turned, make a note of the cut, bearings will need to be ordered to match the new journal diameter.
Once the machine shop has reground the crank, you can use a rifle brush to remove the excess debris from the oil passages. Then measure the crankshaft again so that you can replace the bearings to get the crank to bearing clearance within specification.

, Remove the core plugs, brackets, guide pins, and everything else still attached to the outside of the engine block. Perform a visual inspection of the engine block itself for any cracks.


If you want to, it might be a good idea to Magnaflux the engine block to look for leaks. Magnaflux should only be used to find leaks on cast iron. Use dye penetrant to find cracks on aluminum blocks. Most machine shops will perform these inspections, and may also pressure test engine blocks and cylinder heads. You may have them hot tank the engine block and cylinder head to clean it while you are at it.

, It's probably best to have this done at the machine shop, but if you've got the necessary tools yourself, you can use a straight edge and a set of feeler gauges to check the deck surface for flatness. Measure the both diagonally and horizontally. If the deck surface exceeds the specification for flatness resurface the block. Use caution when resurfacing not to remove too much material. If too much material is removed you risk having the pistons collide with valves.


Using a dial bore gauge measure each cylinder bore’s taper and for out of round. Inspect each cylinder for discoloration and washboard. Use a rigid stone hone to identify washboard. Check alignment and out of round of the main bearing bores with a dial bore gauge.

, With the spring compressed, remove the valve keepers and slowly release the valve spring out of compression. Once you can remove the compression tool, remove the valve springs and shims. Keep these components in order.

, Try not to force it out, which can scratch the guides. For each valve, you need to remove any carbon buildup or dirt from valves and valve head. If possible have the head shot peened or glass beaded at the machine shop, or use Magnaflux or dye penetrant to find any cracks., Note any flatness which is out of specification so that it can be corrected at the machine shop after inspection. Inspect the guides for excess wear using a dial indicator and check for recession of the valve seats. It's also essential to check for:



Worn valve stems. Use a micrometer and replace any valves whose stems exceed specification.

Worn keeper grooves. Replace any worn keepers.
Thin margins. Margins should be thinner on intake valves than exhaust valves. Replace valves with excessively thin margins.

Length, tension, and squareness. Replace any springs which are worn beyond specification.

, Replace the recessed valve seats and reface all valves which are not going to be replaced. Machine the valve seats. Lubricate the valve stems with engine oil. Install valve seals.


The valve seals come in 3 different types: band, umbrella, or PC type. Pay attention to the order of assembly. Assemble valve heads. Check for leaks using either a liquid test or a vacuum test, or have them perform this at the machine shop.

, Machine shops do make mistakes, but its your job to double-check their work. Check that the oil channels and openings of the oiling system in the block are free and clear of all metal shavings, dirt and debris.Wash block using hot soapy water, then blow dry thoroughly to remove any moisture from the engine. Blow out all bolt holes using compressed air to remove any debris prior to installing fasteners.

, Install oil gallery plugs and core plugs using hardening sealer. Never use silicone sealer in these areas, which can dissolve and also could form into rubbery debris in the oiling system.


Prepare to lubricate main bearings by cleaning and drying the main bearing bores and the backs of the bearings. Lubricate the inside of all the main bearings and the lip on rear main seal with the recommended OEM oil/grease. Then install main bearings and rear main seal, keeping sure install in the correct position.

, Grease the camshaft bearings with high pressure grease, then install the camshaft. Since the caps are sensitive to position and direction, snug the caps and then torque them onto the block from the center moving out.


Rotate crank to see if it binds up. If the crank rotates smoothly, then next check the end play.

, Be sure to align the timing marks correctly during reassembly and degree the cam.


To degree the cam and set the timing, aligning the timing marks at Top Dead Center and set the degree wheel correctly on the cam, with the crankshaft/piston timing and proper valve timing sequences for intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the engine.

, Check piston ring end gaps for OEM clearances. You may need oversize rings. If the rings are too small in diameter they'll have excessive end gap, but if they're too large then they'll be too tight and can bind, perhaps even breaking when the engine heats up.


When you're installing, you should stagger the ring end gaps on the pistons. The tiny gap at the end of each ring are turned 180 degrees apart around the piston, compared to the next ring, reducing what's sometimes called ""blow-by"". Be sure the oil expander ring is fitted/butted properly.

, Use rod journal protectors and lubricate the rod inserts, then install and torque rod caps. While you are installing the rods, first barely snug and then torque these gradually in 3 stages to ensure that they all seat evenly and properly.


Continue rotating the crankshaft after installing each piston and torquing the rod caps to make sure it still rotates freely. If gets too hard to turn, you'll know the last piston in that cylinder or the rod inserts are binding--insert halves must snug up without the end of one insert slipping under the other half. Spin test crank after each bearing is installed.

, The gasket may be directional, so be sure to install in the correct direction. Remember to put in the head to block bolt or the OHC belt will never run true and then shred. Only use ""gasket cement"" if the manufacturer instructs you to.

, Lube the bolt threads and washers with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) lubricant or sealer, then torque the bolts down in 3 stages using the OEM specified pattern. Pay close attention to both the length and the location of the bolts.

, Be sure to lubricate the parts as you install them and adjust the valves as necessary. Use a minimum of up/down motion, and then torque using 1 round of preload 

, If you're doing a complete overhaul, it's likely you'll want to do other jobs at the same time while you've got the chance. Likewise, it's usually inadvisable to hook up your freshly-rebuilt engine to a transmission with 200,000 miles (320,000 km) on it. You might want to:


Install a transmission
Replace the air conditioner
Change out the radiator
Get a new starter

, Fill the new oil filter with motor oil before installing, and with break-in oil recommended by the engine rebuilder. Prime the oiling system by manually operating the oil pump. Fill the cooling system with a 50/50 mixture of new antifreeze coolant and distilled water.You'll also probably need to install:


OEM spark plugs
new distributor cap, rotor and spark plug wires
new air filter, fuel filter, crankcase filter and PCV valve

, It's important to keep the engine level while lowering it into place. Use caution, and help. Fasten it to the mounting brackets and reconnect all the hoses, pipes, and wires, having ensured that they're all compatible with any new parts you've installed. Reinstall the radiator and hood, being sure to keep anything meltable clear of the exhaust headers.

, Set the emergency brake and block up the wheels before you start the ignition.Turn the ignition. If the engine doesn't start, check the fuel delivery system.


Make sure to monitor the oil pressure gauge and the temp gauge. If you notice full oil pressure, cut the engine immediately and check for fluid leaks. If you notice anything unusual, stop the engine immediately.

, After you get the engine running reliably, rev it to 2000 rpm to thin out any oil on the camshaft. You'll want to run the engine at various speeds between 1800 and 2500 rpm for at least 20 minutes.Pull the radiator cap to check for adequate flow or leaks before it gets too hot. Check that the battery is charging.

, It's important to ease the engine into its life, and it's common to change the oil after about 100 or 200 miles (160 or 320 km) initially, then every thousand miles for at least the first three months of use.

Use this method for side windows only.,
Wipe the window with soapy water.,
Prepare your scraping tool.,
Cut the edge of the tint.,
Tear off the tint.,
Use long cuts to remove the remaining tint.,
Scrape off adhesive.",How to Remove Car Tint2," Scraping off tint is simple, but only appropriate for side windows, since the rear windshield can be damaged by the razor blade. Both ordinary side windows and smaller ""vent windows"" can have tint removed this way.

, Sponge the interior of the window until it is dripping with soapy water. This protects the window from scratches, so make sure not to leave any dry patches.


Any mild soap will do, but you may wish to choose an unscented one.
You can protect upholstery using a cloth or tarp, or just open the car door before you begin.

, Purchase a brand new box of razor blades, since a sharp edge prevents scratches and you may blunt quite a few on each window. A locking scraper or other blade holder will make the process more convenient.

, Run the razor blade along one edge of the tint. Avoid scratching the dotted frit surrounding the tint.

, Use the blade edge to lift the cut tint, then pull it up. Most likely, it will tear into a few pieces, in which case you'll need to repeat the cut and lift until the entire edge is lifted from the glass.

, Remove the tint in sections by making long, straight cuts with the razor, then lifting and peeling off that section. Repeat until the window is free of tin.

, Look closely for remaining pieces of tint around the edges, and blobs of clear adhesive anywhere in the window. Apply more soapy water and use the razor blade to squeegee these off.

Use this method for rear windshields.,
Wait for a sunny day.,
Protect the interior of the car.,
Cut out two sections of a black, plastic trash bag.,
Attach the outer plastic using soapy water (optional).,
Spray the inside with an ammonia-based cleaner.,
Attach the second plastic sheet to the inside.,
Let the window heat up.,
Peel off the tint.,
Clean up the window.",How to Remove Car Tint3," Defroster lines and sometimes radio antennae run across the rear windshield. These are easily damaged if you try to scrape off the tint, so they require a more gentle process. Even this method can be difficult with some types of tint, so take it to a professional if you are not willing to risk damaging the wires.

, A warm or hot day is best, but if you're patient you can try this on a cool day with full sun and not much wind. Get started in the late morning or early afternoon, while the sun is most direct.


If there are no sunny days coming up, you can apply the heat yourself with a heat gun or hair dryer. This less even heating method risks leaving strips of tint on the glass, which can be a pain to remove, but in winter it may be the only DIY method available.

, Lay down tarp or cloth to protect upholstery and other interior surfaces from stains.

, Choose a glossy, black plastic trash bag, as this will trap the most heat. Cut it open so it's a single sheet, then lay it along the outside rear windshield. Cut out an outline the shape of the windshield. Repeat with the interior of the windshield to make a second plastic rectangle.

, Sponge the outside of the window using soapy water. Stick the sheet of plastic over the window and flatten it as much as you can.If it doesn't stick, use more soap.


The only purpose of this step is to trap more heat in the window, so you can skip it if you are working on a hot day in full sun.

, Formula 409, Simple Green, or Windex all contain enough ammonia to dissolve the adhesive attaching the tint. Pure ammonia will also work, but because it gives off harmful fumes, it should only be applied while wearing a face mask., Stick the other plastic sheet onto the inside of the rear windshield, flatting it as much as possible.

, Leave the car in direct sunlight for at least 30 minutes on a hot day, or up to 3 hours on a cool day. If there is no direct sunlight, use a heat gun on low to heat the entire windshield as evenly as possible.


Some professionals recommend letting the window heat up for 15 minutes, then spraying more ammonia under the interior trash bag and letting it heat another 15.

, Remove the trash bags and start peeling off the tint slowly from the interior of the glass, starting at one corner. If the tint doesn't remove smoothly, leaves a solid layer behind, or looks hazy, stop immediately and soak the glass again for another 15–30 minutes before trying again. Once the adhesive is full removed, the tint should peel off in one piece.

, The tint usually leaves some adhesive on the windshield. Use more ammonia-based cleaner and a squeegee to remove this, using gentle pressure only around the defroster lines. Extra fine steel wool (grade 0000 or 000) may be necessary for stubborn adhesive, but never use this around defroster lines, and never use coarser grades of steel wool that can scratch glass. Once all the adhesive is removed, wipe the window with paper towels before the ammonia dries on.

Check the engine’s cooling system.,
Clear the engine’s nose to facilitate the breathing.,
Feed the engine regularly with new engine oil.,
Keep an eye on the fuel filters.,
Get frequent tune-ups.",How to Maintain Your Car Engine for Higher Efficiency," The cooling system in an engine helps it to maintain its internal temperatures and transfer excessive heat out of the engine. The cooling system must not be left unattended every time when you plan a long journey. The cooling system contains different parts, such as the radiator, thermostat, water pump and coolant.


A straightforward way to look after and safeguard your engine from overheating is by checking that it has the appropriate quantity of coolant flowing inside the engine’s cooling chambers.
Always keep the coolant level above the minimum level but below the maximum level to avoid any leakage.
Very deeply coloured coolant in orange or red must be replaced with the fresh coolant by flushing out the radiator.
Maintaining the cooling system costs far less than the damage done by overheating.;
, The engine utilizes the air to burn the fuel in the combustion chambers and it breathes in just the same manner that humans do. It is vital that you regularly check the vehicle's air filters. Cars need a continuous stream of air to run efficiently. With the exception of fuel, air is a fundamental component in charging the car engine with energy. The air needs to enter into the engine frequently, without any constraints.


Take a glance at your air filter and check that it is dirt-free and free of bugs, etc. Swap it with a clean filter if needed.

, To keep your engine clean, you need good engine oil. Regular changes of engine oil are vital. Engine oil lubricates the essential engine parts, preventing them from overheating and reducing wear and tear. If you lengthen the oil changing intervals too much, it can seriously damage your engine and cause permanent harm.


Consult your vehicle’s manual for the oil changes intervals; most updated standards suggest changing the engine oil after every 5,000 miles (8,000 km). However, note that some old motors can’t go as long, so change oils more frequently for such cars.

, The fuel filters play an important role in ensuring clean fuel injection into the engine. This guards the engine against the build-up of damaging deposits and prevents the emergence of specks in the fuel supply. Fuel filters stop any substances or undesirable particles from forming, which can be destructive to the engine.


The removed particles accumulate in a pan, just as with the oil filter. It is necessary to replace the fuel filter to make your engine’s run smoothly. Replace it with a new filter to keep the gas flowing into the engine efficiently.

, Frequent tunings of the engine’s carburetors is necessary. Also change the spark plugs and check the cables, ignition wires, cap and rotor. However, newer models need less regular tune-ups, as the majority of modern cars don't have the ignition wires or distributors found in older cars but instead use lifelong spark plugs. The fuel injection system can be tuned up by using the special injection cleaning solutions; this usually helps to improve the mileage of the vehicle.

, This is a somewhat triangular shaped 16-pin connector that is commonly located underneath the left hand side of the dash near the steering column. If you have trouble locating the DLC, search for the location on the internet using your car’s model and year, or refer to the owner’s manual.

, Turn your ignition on, but do not start your engine. You will see the scanner begin to communicate with the onboard computers in your vehicle. Messages like ""searching for protocol"" and ""establishing data transmission link"" may appear on the scanner's screen.


If the screen stays blank and does not light up, jiggle the connector to achieve a better contact between the scanner and DLC connector pins. Older cars in particular may have poorer connections.
If you still aren't having any luck, be sure that your cigar lighter works. This is because the OBD-II system uses the cigar lighter circuit to provide voltage to the DLC. If the cigar lighter does not work, locate and check the appropriate fuse.

, On some scanners, you will need to input your VIN as well as the make and model of the vehicle. You may also need to specify the engine type. This process will vary depending on the scanner.

, When the scanner finishes booting up, look for a menu. Select “Codes” or “Trouble Codes” to open the main Codes menu. Depending on your scanner and year of the vehicle you may be presented with a few systems such as Engine/Powertrain, Transmission, Airbag, Brakes etc. When you pick one, you will see two or more types of codes. The most common are Active codes and Pending codes.


Active codes are live codes or malfunctions that are keeping your Check Engine Light on. Just because your Check Engine Light is off doesn't mean the code or malfunction disappeared, it just means that the code setting conditions haven't occurred for two or more operations of the vehicle.
Pending codes mean that the OBD-II monitoring system has failed the operation of an emission control system at least once and if it fails again the Check Engine Light will be turned on and the malfunction becomes an Active code.

, Each code will start with a letter which designates what system the code is referring to. There are several letters that you may see, though you may have to move to different menus to see them:



P - Powertrain. This covers the engine, transmission, fuel system, ignition, emissions, and more. This is the largest set of codes.

B - Body. This covers airbags, seat belts, power seating, and more.

C - Chassis. These codes cover ABS, brake fluid, axles, and more.

U - Undefined. These codes cover other aspects of the car., P0xxx, P2xxx, and P3xxx are all generic codes that apply to all makes and models. P1xxx codes are manufacturer specific, such as Honda, Ford, Toyota, etc. The second number tells you what subsystem the code refers to. For example, P07xx codes refer to the transmission.


The last two digits are the specific problem that the code refers to. Check a code chart online for details on each specific code.

, P0301 indicates a misfire condition on cylinder #1. The P indicates it's a powertrain code, the 0 indicates that it is a generic or universal code. The 3 means the area or subsystem is an Ignition System code.The 01 indicates it's a cylinder specific problem, in that there is a misfire condition in the number 1 cylinder. It could mean that the spark plug, plug wire or dedicated ignition coil are worn out or that there is a vacuum leak near the cylinder.
A code does not tell you what component is defective; it only points to or indicates that a component, its circuit, or its wiring/vacuum control are malfunctioning. The code may be the symptom of a malfunction caused by a completely different system.

, The proper diagnosis of OBD-II codes takes years of training and practice. For example, a weak battery or worn out alternator can set five or more codes in systems that are perfectly normal. Before attempting repairs, understand that the codes alone will not tell you what parts need to be replaced or what repairs need to be made.


If you are unsure of what you are doing, take your car to an ASE Certified Master Technician with the L1 Advanced Engine Performance Diagnostic certification, or you could end up wasting a lot of time and money.

, If you’ve made your repairs, or simply don’t want to see your Check Engine Light for a while, you can reset it using most OBD scanners. The light will turn off until the car has been driven a certain amount of time (this varies from manufacturer to manufacturer).You can reset the Check Engine Light from the main menu of most scanners. It is also referred to as a CEL.

Evaluate the problem methodically.,
Check the dashboard light fuse.,
Test the dashboard light bulbs.,
Acquire a professional opinion.",How to Fix Dashboard Lights That Won't Light," Begin the process by trying the simplest of solutions first. Most vehicles have a dashboard lights control switch that will dim the dashboard lights, as well as turn them off. Check the control switch, which should be located on the console near the steering column or part of the headlight switch.


If you are having trouble locating the dashboard lights control switch, refer to your vehicle's owner manual for further assistance.;
, A blown fuse can disable the vehicle's dashboard light. The fuse box may be under the hood, or near the floor, near the brake pedal, or there may be two fuse boxes in both places. Refer to the diagram on the fuse box cover to locate the correct fuse. Replace the dashboard light fuse if necessary. Note: also check if the tail lights are working. Tail lights and dash lights are connected through the tail light (and/or brake light) fuse. When the dashboard goes dark you know you are driving without tail lights.


Make certain to use the exact replacement dashboard light fuse to avoid the potential of electrical failure in your vehicle's dashboard.

, If the fuses are working properly, check for a blown bulb in the dashboard. Following the manufacturer's instructions, disconnect the battery while working on the dash, remove the faceplate covering your vehicle's dashboard gauge panel. Remove the screws holding the plate on. Carefully remove the faceplate. The bulb sockets should be on the back of the panel. Some panels are LED type bulbs and bulbs are not replaceable.These panels will have to be repaired by a certified instrument panel service facility.


Twist and pull the bulb to retrieve it from the socket. To prevent breaking the glass, be careful not to turn or pull the bulb too hard.
Once you have removed the bulb, examine the filament for damage. If the glass inside the bulb is charred or discolored, replace the light bulb using the exact type of bulb.
Purchase a new bulb and bulb grease from an auto parts store. Apply grease on the metal base to increase the longevity of the bulb.
If you are uncertain of the light bulb's condition, allow a customer service representative at the auto parts store examine it.
If the bulb is not bad, carefully reinsert it, applying a small dab of light bulb grease on the metal base of the bulb.
If you find more than one bulb that is bad then, it is recommended to replace all the bulbs as a set. Once they start failing, then it is likely all will fail soon.

, If attempting to isolate the problem proves unsuccessful, consider taking your vehicle to a qualified mechanic to fix dashboard lights that won't light. The problem may be in the electrical system, or faulty wiring. Get at least 1 additional estimate if you are uncomfortable with the price a mechanic quotes you.

Disconnect the battery.,
Disconnect the plug wire from cylinder one.,
Remove the spark plug from cylinder number one.,
Install the piston stop tool into cylinder number one.",How to Find Your Engine's Top Dead Center (TDC)1," Before beginning the project, use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut holding the black “ground” cable on the negative terminal of the battery. Pull the cable up off of the terminal and tuck it to the side of the battery to prevent it from coming back into contact with the terminal until you’re done.Disconnecting the battery will prevent you from shocking yourself or causing any blown fuses while you work.
The car will not be able to start with the battery disconnected.;
, Refer to your vehicle’s service manual for help identifying which spark plug coincides with cylinder one. Once you’ve found it, grip the spark plug wire at the base where it connects to the spark plug and pull it backward to remove it.Make sure you check the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle.
Do not pull on the spark plug wire itself, but rather from its base, when removing spark plug wires.

, Use a spark plug socket and a long extension on your wrench to remove the spark plug in the cylinder one position of your vehicle. Rotate the plug counter clockwise to unthread it before pulling it out.The spark plug will stick in the spark plug socket thanks to a rubber ring inside it.
Check the spark plug for any signs of damage, then set it aside someplace safe.

, Take your piston stop tool and insert it into the spark plug socket you used to remove the spark plug. Lower it into the same hole you removed the spark plug from, and thread it into place carefully by turning it in a clockwise direction.Be extremely careful not to allow any debris to fall into the spark plug hole as you switch it out for the piston stop tool.
You can purchase a piston stop tool and most auto parts stores.
The piston stop tool doesn’t have to be too tight. Simply make it snug by hand.

Use a wrench to slowly rotate the motor.,
Never use the starter to rotate the engine.,
Mark the pulley when the piston hits the stopper.,
Rotate the engine back the other way.,
Find the center point between the two marks.",How to Find Your Engine's Top Dead Center (TDC)2," Locate the crank pulley near the bottom of the engine. This circular pulley provides power to accessories like your power steering and air conditioning through the serpentine or accessory belts. At the center of the pulley will be a nut. Place an appropriately sized wrench on the nut and turn it counter-clockwise to rotate the motor.Be sure to use the correct size wrench or socket, otherwise you could damage the bolt on the pulley.
It may take a decent amount of force to rotate the motor. Larger motors will be even more difficult than smaller ones.

, As you go about determining top dead center, you will need to rotate the engine assembly. Do not turn the key in the ignition to use the starter to do so, as it can cause serious damage to the engine if the piston strikes the piston stop tool you inserted.With the battery disconnected, you won’t be able to start the engine.
Never attempt to start the engine while you have portions of it disassembled.

, Continue to turn the pulley with the wrench until the piston in cylinder one comes into contact with the piston stop tool. When it stops, mark the pulley location on the harmonic dampener surrounding the pulley with a marker.Be sure you can clearly make out the mark you draw on the harmonic dampener.
A sharpie or paint pen will both work to make your mark on the harmonic dampener.

, Once you’ve made your first mark, use the hand or socket wrench on the crank pulley to rotate the engine back in a clockwise direction until it comes into contact with the piston stopper tool once again.Mark the second spot on the harmonic dampener where the pulley stopped turning because of the stopper tool.
Be sure both marks are clearly visible on the harmonic dampener before moving on.

, With both marks clearly visible, find the center point by measuring the distance between them and dividing by two. That should allow you to measure from on of the two lines and identify the exact center point between the two. That center point is top dead center.Be sure to remove the piston stop tool and return the spark plug prior to starting the engine.
Reconnect the battery to restore power to the vehicle once you’re done.

Remove the spark plug from cylinder one.,
Place your thumb over the spark plug hole.,
Have a friend rotate the crankshaft with a wrench.,
Look into the hole with a flashlight to find TDC.",How to Find Your Engine's Top Dead Center (TDC)3," Instead of removing the spark plug to replace it with a stopper tool, you can use your thumb to get a good approximation of top dead center that will be accurate enough for you to install your distributor or spark plug wires, but will not be specific enough to align your camshafts.Make sure to remove the spark plug using a spark plug socket, otherwise it will simply unthread and remain in the hole.
Be extremely careful not to allow anything to fall in the hole while the spark plug is removed.

, As the engine rotates, the piston will rise inside cylinder one and you’ll be able to feel the increase in pressure. Take your thumb and insert it into the hole the spark plug came out of so you’ll be able to feel the change in pressure within the cylinder.Make sure your thumb is positioned to it creates a seal over the hole.

, As you keep your thumb over the spark plug hole, have a friend rotate the engine counter clockwise using a wrench of the appropriate size. Have them continue to rotate the engine until the increase in pressure pushes your thumb off the spark plug hole as it nears top dead center. Pay attention as your friend rotates the motor so you’ll notice when your thumb is pushed off the hole.
As soon as your thumb moves it will relieve the pressure, allowing you to place it over the hole again.

, Once your thumb has been pushed off the spark plug hole, use a flashlight to peer down into the hole at how close the cylinder is to the hole itself. Have your friend rotate the motor very slowly as you watch to get it as close as possible to top dead center.This process is accurate to within 15 degrees, so it should not be used to install new camshafts.
Make sure to reconnect the battery after reinstalling the spark plug.

You can find information pertaining to what bulb to purchase in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If you do not have the owner’s manual, you can ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to assist you.
You can also find bulb information on the automakers web site.;
, Before beginning any project that involves your vehicle’s electrical system, you should always disconnect the battery to prevent damage or injury. Use the appropriate sized hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut on the cable going to the negative terminal on your battery. Tuck the cable to the side of the battery so it can’t come back into contact with the negative terminal.
You do not need to remove the positive cable.

, If the blown out signal bulb is in the back of the vehicle, you will likely need to open the trunk in order to access it. If the blown out bulb is in the front of the vehicle, your best point of access will probably be under the hood.Ask a friend to stand in front of the vehicle, then behind it, as you test your turn signals to identify which one or ones need to be replaced.

, You may need to remove trim or even body components in order to access the signal bulb in your vehicle. Determine how best to access the turn signal bulb by either examining the area around the turn signal or by referring to the service manual for your specific vehicle. Generally, if you can spot screws holding the outside cover down, this will be an easy access point.The service manual for your vehicle will explain exactly how to remove any components between you and the blown out bulb.
In many vehicles, you will be able to determine how to access the bulb simply by looking.

, Once you have determined how best to access the bulb, remove any body or trim pieces that are in the way. Be careful not to damage the finish on painted body components. Plastic trim pieces are often held in place with fasteners that may break when removed. You can purchase replacement trim fasteners at most auto parts stores.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual if you are uncertain of how to remove a body or trim component.

, Once you have gotten access to the where the signal bulb is housed, first disconnect the wiring harness that powers the bulb. In most applications, this requires pulling back or pressing in on a clip, then pulling the harness backward away from the bulb housing. Be sure to pull on the clip rather than the wires, as the wires may accidentally come free from the harness.

, With the wiring removed, grip the base of the plastic bulb seat and turn it counter clockwise (to the left). Most vehicles design the bulb to be seated quickly with a quick-release system and typically only requires a quarter turn before it’s released completely. It may take a bit of force to loosen the bulb in some applications.

, Once the bulb is loose, pull it backward out of its housing. The bulb should slide right out once it has been unscrewed a quarter turn. With the wiring disconnected, you should be able to remove the bulb and its plastic seat together in one motion.The seat for the bulb comes out with it to make it easy to swap signal bulbs.
Be careful not to misplace the seat after you remove the old bulb.

, Remove the old bulb by holding the plastic seat in one hand and gripping as close to the base of the bulb in the other. Pull the two apart and the old bulb should pop out. Then remove the new bulb from the packaging and insert it into the seat. Be careful not to break the old bulb by squeezing it too hard, as that may cut you.
If you do break the old bulb, remove it from the housing using pliers to avoid cutting yourself on broken glass.

, When handling the new bulb, do not allow your skin to touch the bulb. Oils coating your skin can adhere to the glass of the bulb and damage the bulb when it is turned on and operating at high temperatures. Use a rag instead to handle the bulb and insert it into the plastic seat. If you do touch the bulb, wipe it down with some rubbing alcohol to clean it off.

, With the new bulb in the plastic seat, insert them both back into the hole in the signal light housing. Once pressed in fully, turn the bulb clockwise (to the right) a quarter turn to lock it into place. The bulb and plastic seat should lock in place and not move around once secure.
If you have difficulty reinserting the bulb, check to make sure there is nothing blocking the entry way, then reinsert it.

, With the new bulb and seat securely fastened within the turn signal housing, reconnect the wiring you disconnected earlier. When connecting the wire harness to the bulb seat, you should be able to simply press it onto the clip until they connect. You will hear a click when the harness is firmly seated and connected.
Tug on the clip lightly just to ensure it is securely fastened.

, Before reassembling the trim or body components you removed to access the turn signal, reconnect the battery and ask a friend to test the turn signals. Watch the signal you just installed and make sure it functions properly. Have your friend test the turn signals, hazard flashers and brake lights to ensure they all function.
If the turn signal does not work, check the connection to ensure it is secure.

, After you’ve checked to make sure your new turn signal bulb is working, reinstall any pieces of the vehicle you removed in order to access the bulb. If there were multiple components, replace them in the opposite order you removed them in, as parts often overlap and must be installed in the correct order. If you find yourself unsure of how to replace the trim or body pieces you removed, refer to the vehicle’s service manual for guidance.
Replace any damaged fasteners with matching ones from your local auto parts store.

Check the fuse.,
Look at the tail lamp wiring.,
Check the taillight bulbs.,
Check the taillight lenses.,
Remove the taillight lens.

,
Repair lens cracks with lens repair tape.,
Repair holes and broken spots with lens repair resin.",How to Fix Car Tail Lights," A blown fuse usually causes both lights to go out. On newer cars, the tail lamps can be fused separately and/or each bulb or shared circuit can be fused. A fuse can be blown due to other problems, so you'll need to check more than just the fuse, but it's the right place to start. Look in your owner's manual to determine where the fuse box is located in your car. On older cars, the fuse box is located under the dash. On most newer cars it can be located under the hood or the dash. The manual will have a labeled picture of the fuse box showing which fuse is which. Making sure the ignition is off, take the cover off of the fuse box and locate the taillight fuse. Use a flashlight to inspect the fuse and determine whether it's blown. On most new cars, the fuse would have to be removed to be checked due to the arrangement of the fuses.


If the piece of metal inside the taillight fuse is intact, the fuse is still good.






If the piece of metal looks broken or fractured, the fuse is blown and will need replacing. Use your fingers or a tweezer to take out the fuse. Most new cars have a fuse extractor in the fuse box or in the tool kit. It is a small white plastic tool that resembles a pair of pliers. Bring it to an auto store to find a match, then buy a replacement and insert it in the proper position to replace the blown fuse.





;
, These are the wires that lead to the tail lights, located inside the lid of the trunk. Open the trunk and take a look. You can see where the wires should connect in order for the electrical system to properly work. If a wire has come loose, reattach it.


On most new cars, the wiring harness is located behind panels in the trunk and is not accessible without removing the panels.

, If the fuse and wiring look right, the bulbs themselves might be the problem. To check them, unscrew the taillight lenses from the outside using a screwdriver. If your lenses don't have screws, open the trunk so you can access the lights from the inside. Unscrew the bulbs in question and check them the way you would any household bulb: by looking at the filament wire inside them to determine if it is still intact. The bulb can be checked by tapping it against your hand to see if the filament is moving or vibrating.


Most tail lamps have stop lamp/turn indicator bulb(s), reverse lamp bulb, tail lamp bulbs, side marker bulb, and on some models a self standing turn indicator bulb. On cars where the brake and turn signal are sharing a bulb, when the bulb is burnt out, the turn signal indicator will flash faster than normal. This will apply also if the vehicle has a burnt out turn signal bulb in the rear amber turn indicator.
If the bulb is burnt out, you'll need to replace it. Take it to your local auto store and buy the correct model for your car.






If the bulb is fine, your car may have a deeper electrical problem. If the fuse, taillight wires, and bulb are all in good shape, it's time to take the car to the mechanic.






When you remove a bulb for replacement, you should inspect the socket for burnt contacts and the tail lamp for burnt contacts or melted socket boards.

, Whether or not you were able to fix the problem of your tail lights working correctly by examining the fuse, wiring and light bulb, it's important to check the lenses as well to make sure they're not cracked or broken. Water entering the lens can burn out a bulb. Keep reading to learn how to repair a broken or cracked lens.

,, Using tape is meant to only be a temporary fix. You purchase tape or buy a lens repair kit that comes with resin that you simply place over the crack to make it waterproof again.


You want to clean and dry the area where the tape is to be applied. Just before adding the tape wipe the area with a lint free cloth that is wet with rubbing alcohol, and let it dry, then apply the tape. Do not use glass cleaner to clean the area because the ammonia in the glass cleaner will cause the tape not to stick as well as it should. The last wipe with rubbing alcohol will remove most of the impurities and leave a clean surface.






Measure the size of the crack and cut the tape slightly larger than the damage of the lens.






Remove the backing of the tape.






Smooth out the air bubbles when you apply the tape, so they don't distort the lens.







, If there's a gouge or broken spot, you can fill in the hole with plastic resin. Buy a lens repair kit that comes with supplies for filling in the holes. Cover the outside of the taillight with the plastic tape that comes with the repair kit, to prevent the plastic resin from leaking through.






Mix the resin with a catalyst and coloring agent according to the instructions included in the kit. Wear a pair of disposable gloves during this part of the process to avoid getting resin on your skin.






Pour the resin into the provided syringe.






Squirt the resin into the hole, making sure it covers the entire area that needs to be filled.






Let it cure for at least 2 hours.






Remove the tape and sand the surface to smooth it out.

Visually inspect the wiring.,
Test the return of the switch.",How to Fix a Stuck Brake Light1," Before doing any work on the electrical system in your vehicle, you should always disconnect the battery. This will ensure you don’t shock yourself or damage anything as you work. Use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut securing the ground cable to the negative terminal of the battery. Slip the cable off and tuck it to the side of the battery.You can locate the negative terminal by finding the letters “NEG” on the battery or looking for the negative (-) symbol.
You will not need to disconnect the positive terminal.;
, You will need to look around on the underside of your dashboard for this project, so it’s important that you put on eye protection to ensure no debris falls into your eyes. You will not need gloves for this project, but may choose to wear them to avoid poking yourself with wires.Goggle style eye protection offers the highest level of protection.
Glasses style eye protection will suffice for this task.

, The brake pedal switch is a button located along the shaft of the brake pedal, above the foot pad. As you press the pedal, the shaft presses the button, which turns on the brake lights.If you are unsure where to locate your brake pedal switch, refer to the service manual for your specific vehicle.
The switch will have a wired pigtail coming off of it and will be mounted directly behind the brake pedal.

, The wiring pigtail for the switch will be held in place with a plastic housing. Press on the clip release on the plastic housing to allow the pigtail to disconnect from the switch, then pull on the plastic portion of the pigtail to disconnect it.Do not pull on the wires themselves as it may disconnect or tear them away from the pigtail harness.
Be very careful not to break the plastic clip.

, Look inside the pigtail harness for signs of burning or melting. If the wiring has overheated, the pigtail may have been damaged, resulting in the brake light staying on permanently. Any signs of damage inside the wiring pigtail could cause issues with your brake lights.A damaged pigtail will have to be replaced in order to make your brake lights function properly.
You may need to order the brake light switch pigtail from a dealership for some vehicles if they are not carried at your local auto parts store.

, The switch itself is a long button that is pressed when you press the brake pedal down with your foot. While under the dashboard, press in on the pedal or on the button itself and see if the button pops back out when you release it. If it doesn’t, it likely means that the button is sticking in the “on” position.If the button is sticking in the “on” position, it will leave the brake light on all the time.
Have a friend stand behind the car to see if pressing and depressing the switch has any effect on the brake lights.
If the button doesn’t affect the lights, there may be a blown fuse or the switch itself may have gone bad.

Reconnect the switch to the linkage and the harness.",How to Fix a Stuck Brake Light2," Before removing the brake light switch, you need to be sure the pigtail is disconnected. If you already disconnected it to inspect it for damage, leave it hanging as you remove the switch. If not, disconnect it now by pressing on the plastic release and pulling back on the plastic housing.Unless the pigtail harness needs to be replaced, you will reuse it with the new brake light switch.
If you break the release, you may be able to use electric tape to hold the pigtail in place upon reassembly to avoid purchasing a new one.

, Different vehicles mount the brake light switch to the pedal linkage in different ways. If it is not readily apparent how to remove the switch from the pedal, refer to the service manual for your specific year, make and model vehicle.The switch is usually held in place with one or two small bolts.
Be careful not to lose the mounting hardware. You will need to reuse them when installing the new switch.

, With the old switch removed, slide the new switch into place exactly where the old one was. Use the mounting hardware that held the previous switch in place to secure the new one in the same manner.Replace the bolts that secure the switch if they were damaged in the process of removing them.

, Plug the brake light switch pigtail into the new switch and reattach any other connections you may have needed to disconnect in your specific vehicle. The switch should now be in place behind the shaft of the brake pedal and connected to the vehicle.Reconnect the battery and start the vehicle.

Locate the appropriate fuse box.,
Identify the fuse for the brake lights.,
Remove the fuse and inspect it for damage.,
Replace a damaged fuse with one rated for the same amperage.",How to Fix a Stuck Brake Light3," Most vehicles have at least two fuse boxes located throughout the body. One is often under the hood with a second fuse box on the driver’s side of the cabin. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to determine which fuse box houses the fuse for your brake lights.You may need to remove a fuse box cover or pieces of the interior trim to access the fuse box.
If you do not have an owner’s manual for your vehicle, try referring to the automaker’s website.

, Use the diagram in your owner’s manual or on the inside of the fuse box cover to determine which fuse powers the brake lights. A bad brake light fuse may have resulted in the lights being stuck on or off.There may be more than one fuse for your brake lights. If that is the case, you will need to check each of them.

, Use a pair of needle nose pliers or plastic tongs to remove the fuse from its spot in the fuse box. Look into the fuse if it has a clear housing. If the metal is broken or burned inside the fuse, it will need to be replaced.If you can’t look inside the fuse, inspect the ends for damage or signs of burning.
Most automotive fuses have translucent covers to allow you to inspect them. If the cover itself is damaged so you can’t see through it, the fuse is likely bad.

, Identify the amperage required for your brake light fuse by looking at the chart. Most automotive fuses are between 5 and 50 amps, with a number listed along the top of the fuse. Insert a new fuse in the spot you removed the faulty brake light fuse from. Once done, replace the lid to the fuse box and any interior pieces you may have needed to move to get to it.Reconnect the battery and start the vehicle.
Have a friend stand behind it to check to see if the brake lights function properly.

Listen for grinding.,
Pay close attention to vehicle vibrations.,
Tie the vibration to engine speed or wheel speed.,
Pay attention to jerky shifts.,
Watch the tachometer.",How to Troubleshoot Your Transmission1," Any time you hear grinding while driving your vehicle means trouble. Grinding while trying to put a manual transmission into or out of gear can be indicative of your clutch failing to engage or disengage completely or it may be a result of worn synchro gears in the transmission itself. If you hear grinding while in gear, it means there is metal caught in the gears of the transmission and it will likely fail very soon.Pull the vehicle over immediately if you hear grinding while moving.
You will need to have your vehicle towed home or to a repair facility.
If the transmission grinds going into or out of certain gears, you can try double clutch shifting to get it through the gears without causing more damage.;
, There are many things that can cause vibrations as you drive. While some may be as benign as a rock stuck in your tire or ice on your rims, others can indicate a serious issue with your transmission. If you hear or feel a new vibration as you drive, pull over and check your wheels and tires first. If they appear not to have any issues to speak of, the vibration is likely due to a problem with the drivetrain.The drivetrain in your vehicle includes the engine, transmission, transfer cases and drive shafts.
Try to get a sense of wear in the vehicle the vibration is coming from.

, While driving and diagnosing a vibration, accelerate by pressing on the gas and assess whether or not the vibration speeds up, slows down or goes away. Now take the vehicle out of gear (in neutral) and press on the gas again. Determine if there is a difference between how the vibration acts in each instance. If the vibration only occurs at certain speeds, it may be an unbalanced wheel.
If the vibration goes away or stays constant while the vehicle is not in gear, it may be an issue with the wheels or drive shafts going to them.
If the vibration increases with the RPMs of the engine, the issue is likely in the engine or transmission.

, When driving a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission, pay attention to the way it shifts from gear to gear. Automatic transmissions should shift fairly smoothly. If shifting feels abrupt or causes you to lurch forward, the transmission is struggling to shift into the next gear.Hard shifting could indicate low or over worn transmission fluid.
Pull over at a safe location and ensure the transmission fluid is not too low before driving the vehicle home.

, Automatic transmissions are designed to shift at different RPMs based on the amount of throttle you input. If you are accelerating quickly (with the pedal to the floor) the transmission will shift at a higher RPM than under normal driving. That said, the transmission should not allow the vehicle to sit at a high RPM for long before shifting to the next gear. If it is, there is an issue.You can usually hear when your car plateau’s at an RPM it should be shifting from.
Listen for the sound of the engine working harder than it normally would as it stays in a lower gear for too long.

Look for leaking transmission fluid.,
Make sure the transmission fluid is full.,
Assess the state of the transmission fluid.,
Take note of how long it takes to shift out of park.",How to Troubleshoot Your Transmission2," A common cause of issues with automatic transmissions is low fluid levels caused by leaks. Look beneath your vehicle for wet spots. If you find one, touch it with your finger, then wipe your finger on a white sheet of paper to determine what kind of fluid it is by color.Automatic transmission fluid is usually red, or dark red if it is old and has been burned.
Coolant is usually green or orange.
Oil is usually brown or black.

, If you have seen signs of leaking, check your transmission immediately by locating the dip stick for your transmission fluid. Much like an oil dipstick, there will be minimum and full lines clearly shown on the stick. Remove the dipstick and wipe it off, then re-insert it and remove it again to check the fluid levels. If the fluid level is low, adding transmission fluid may resolve the issue you’re having. If you are unsure where to find the transmission fluid dipstick in your vehicle, refer to its owner’s manual for guidance.
Check the transmission fluid levels even if there is no sign of leaking, just in case it was not filled completely when it was last serviced or if it has been burning fluid.

, Look at the fluid on the dipstick and assess the color. Automatic transmission fluid is dark red in color, but it grows darker the longer it is in use. Dark color is not necessarily indicative of an issue unless it is nearly black in color and smells burnt. Conversely, if the color is extremely light or pink, it means water has gotten into the transmission fluid, which is also a serious problem. Draining and flushing your transmission fluid is not always a viable solution, but in some cases it is required.Black or extremely dark red transmission fluid means the transmission has been operating at above its safe temperature range.
Pink transmission fluid means there’s water in the fluid. You will need to drain the transmission and replace the fluid.
The source of the water in your transmission fluid must be identified and repaired or it will occur again.

, With your foot on the brake, shift your vehicle out of park and into reverse or drive. While at a stop, shifting out of park should be nearly instantaneous. Count to yourself as you wait. If your count exceeds three seconds, the transmission is not operating the way it should. This may be indicative of over-worn or low transmission fluid.Sluggish shifting, particularly into drive or reverse, often means the transmission fluid is too low or not performing properly.
If the vehicle won’t shift out of park at all, it could mean that the transmission has internal issues and will need to be serviced or replaced.

"
"
Ensure the transmission will shift into each gear.,
Check the level of gear oil in the transmission.,
Determine if the gear oil has been burnt.,
Listen for sounds with the clutch pressed and de-pressed.",How to Troubleshoot Your Transmission3," While stopped with the vehicle running, apply the parking brake and press the clutch pedal to the floor. Shift the transmission through each gear, starting with first and culminating with the highest gear your vehicle’s transmission is equipped with. It should shift into each gear smoothly and without any grinding or crunching.If the vehicle cannot shift into any gears, your clutch may have failed.
If you have issues shifting into a specific gear, it is likely the result of a failed synchro for that gear.

, Manual transmissions are usually lubricated by gear oil instead of automatic transmission fluid (except in specific applications). Many manual transmissions have dipsticks similar to those found in automatic transmissions. Remove the dipstick and ensure the fluid level is correct.If you are unable to find the dipstick on your transmission, refer to your owner’s manual for guidance.
If you need to add gear oil, be sure to check your owner’s manual for the correct type of oil to add.

, When checking the gear oil in your transmission, determining if it has been burned through overheating will be fairly easy. Burned gear oil has a powerful odor that may resemble onions. If the gear oil in your transmission is burned, it will making shifting more difficult and may lead to a breakdown of the components inside.Burned gear oil will need to be drained and replaced.
If the wrong gear oil is added, it may be more likely to burn and lead to mechanical failures. If the wrong oil has been added to your transmission, it will also need to be drained and replaced.

, If you hear a noise that seems to come from the transmission at an idle, press the clutch in and continue to listen. If the sound changes or stops, it is likely caused by a problem with the release or pilot bearing. Other common issues you may be able to diagnose by sound are:A growling or grinding noises when the clutch is engaged likely means a problem with the transmission input shaft bearing.
If you depress the clutch and hear a squealing sound, it is likely caused by a bad pilot bearing or bushing.
A chirping sound that gets louder as you slowly depress the clutch pedal is likely caused by a faulty release bearing.

Park your car with its front tyres touching the curb.,
Try to pull off in 3rd gear with the front wheels at the curb, and without applying throttle.,
Find a smooth, straight road to test the vehicle.",How to Find out if a Transmission Has Gone out1," Engage 1st and start slowly releasing the clutch pedal without applying any throttle. The engine should gradually fade out and bog down when the pedal is completely released. If the engine just bogs down at some point, or the fading is not gradual, the clutch is damaged. If the gearbox grinds when you try to shift in first from a standstill, there's a damage in the clutch too.;
, If the engine doesn't die, it shows a complete clutch failure. In that case, do not drive this vehicle.

, Start from first, and slowly accelerate from second. As you do this use late-shifting, i.e. slightly over-rev the engine (approx. 500-1000 RPM faster than the revs you'd normally shift at). Up-shift to second without using double-clutching. Repeat the same procedure when shifting into 3rd. Now, with your car running at approximately 50 km/h (25 mph) try down-shifting to second without double-clutching. Both the up-shifting and the down-shifting must be done without grinding. Grinding of the gears indicates a gearbox malfunction, most likely in the sync gears (""synchronizers""). To make sure it's the synchronizers, try up-shifting and down-shifting with double-clutching. If the grinding stops, then it's the synchronization.

Find the variables of Torque.,
Calculate the Torque.",How to Measure the Torque (Twisting Power) of Your Favourite Car," There are three main variables of the torque in any engine, which are: the force at specific RPMs, distance, and the constant of the torque. The force is the horsepower of your engine that you can find on the specific revolutions of the engine, or generally the term full motor torque is used to find the force at full RPMs of the engine that usually you can find on the engine specification’s table.


However, it can be found by using the horsepower-to-torque conversion tables. The distance is the length of the stroke; it means the longer the stroke, the more torque generation.






Diesel engines produce more torque than patrol units because the diesel engines use longer stroke bases to compress the air into the cylinder. Usually, the unit for the torque is used as pound-feet or lb/ft.;
, There is no secret in calculating the torque of the engine, but it is just a multiplication of force-to-distance from the center of the crankshaft.  


For instance, if you have lug nuts and you have a wrench with a foot long handle, and you apply 100 pounds of force on it, then you are simply generating the 100 lb/ft of torque.
However, if you have a two foot long wrench handle and you are applying the same force than you are producing the 200 lb/ft of torque with the same force. It was the variable of distance that caused the change in torque at the same power.
As we doubled the distance, the torque was automatically doubled. However, to calculate the full power torque of the engine, you can use the following mathematical formula;Torque = {Force X 5252} / engine RPMsOr T = {HP X 5252} / RPM Where; T = torque in lb/ft and the HP is the horsepower of the engine.






However, the 5252 is the constant and the RPM are the engine revolutions per minutes. For example, if your car is producing the 86 HP at the full motor RPMs of 5500, then you can easily calculate the torque for your car at the 5500 RPMs by applying the formula; it would be 82 lb/ft of torque.

Identify the symptoms of a worn clutch.,
Make sure the clutch itself is at fault.,
Have the clutch replaced as soon as possible.",How to Know if a Car Needs a New Clutch," Usually this is characterised by the clutch slipping as you apply power — the engine speed will increase greatly when you try to accelerate, even though the clutch pedal is not pressed. Under normal driving, a healthy clutch will 'lock' the engine to the transmission, so its speed should be directly linked to changes in the vehicle speed.;
, If your vehicle has a hydraulically-operated clutch, eliminate air in the system by bleeding the hydraulic circuit, as you would with the braking system. A cable-operated clutch could be suffering from a seized or jammed cable, preventing the clutch from taking the full torque from the engine.

, Clutch replacement is an involved job, requiring removal of the transmission to access the clutch. Unless you are an experienced home mechanic, book your car into a garage to have the work done.

Park your car with the front tyres touching the curb with the gearbox in Drive.,
Shift into drive and hold the break pedal after making sure your brakes work.,
Check for smooth shifting.,
Check for vibrations.,
Test steering.",How to Find out if a Transmission Has Gone out2," Start applying throttle smoothly. The car must slowly climb over the curb without the engine fading.

, Press the gas pedal all the way down. The engine should not fade. If it does, it means the transmission (particularly the clutch) does not disengage completely.

, On an even and relatively horizontal road you should be able to accelerate without any tangible jolts. If there are such, the gearbox has malfunctioned.

, Driving at about 70 km/h (35 mph) switch to Neutral (both auto and manual). There shouldn't be any lateral vibrations. If there are, this is either due to a warping of the drive-shaft, or a suspension damage. Basically, drive-shaft warping is perceived as a vibration in both vertical and horizontal direction, whereas a suspension damage is felt as a vibration in only one direction (i.e. either horizontally or vertically).

, When trying to enter a corner with approximately 30 km/h (15 mph) there shouldn't be any tangible under-steer. The presence of such may be due to a differential failure, especially in FWD cars. Novice drivers must never try to test their differentials by trying to induce under/over-steer!

Warm up your vehicle by driving it around for a few minutes.,
Always work on a flat, regular surface.,
Use your owner’s manual to locate a good jacking point and raise the vehicle high enough off the ground to clear your jackstands.

,
Again referring to your owner’s manual, place jack stands on both sides of the vehicle.,
Ensure you have the correct fluid for your vehicle.,
Drain the fluid and remove the transmission oil pan.,
Examine the old transmission fluid.,
Clean the transmission oil pan inside and out.,
Remove and replace the transmission filter.,
Reinstall the transmission oil pan.,
Raise the vehicle off the jackstands.,
Open the hood of your vehicle and find your transmission dipstick.,
Start the engine when the transmission fluid begins to register on the dipstick.,
Top-off fluid and continue to check for leaks.",How to Clean an Automatic Transmission,"


Draining the fluid will go much faster when the fluid is at least warm.
Be careful working around hot vehicle components, especially the exhaust system.;
, Place the vehicle in park, set the parking brake and chock the rear wheels before raising the vehicle.

,, Jack stands allow for much easier access to the relevant components. Jack stands are also much more reliable.

, There are many types of fluid and some manufacturers even require brand specific fluid. Consult your owner’s manual and an automotive parts professional to ensure you have the correct fluid and parts before you begin.

, Position a large drain pan under the transmission oil pan and try not to spill any fluid. Keeping the area under your vehicle clean will help you stay clean.


Look for a drain plug. The drain plug will usually be a standard threaded plug located in one corner of the transmission oil pan. Remove the plug and allow the fluid to drain, then reinstall the drain plug.
If there is no drain plug, draining the fluid will be a little more tricky. Loosen all the bolts on the transmission oil pan and then completely remove the bolts from one side. This will allow the side or corner of the pan to drop enough so that the fluid will run out.
After the fluid has drained fully remove all the bolts and make note of their location. Remove the transmission oil pan. It may need to be tapped loose with a rubber hammer.

, Look for anything that seems out of place like sediment or large pieces of metal in the fluid. This could be indicative of a larger problem, so if you find anything, consult a transmission expert immediately. It is also a good idea to measure the amount of fluid drained because this will give you a good estimate on how much fluid to replace.

, Automatic transmissions are very sensitive to dirt and foreign matter. Use a degreaser to clean the outside of the pan and brake cleaner to clean the inside and the gasket mating surfaces.


Carefully remove all the gasket material from the transmission oil pan and the mating surface on the transmission. A razor blade may be helpful.
Most transmissions have a magnet in the pan to catch small metal particles. Be sure to clean and reinstall the magnet.
Clean the bolts that secure the oil pan to the transmission.

, Most automatic transmissions have a filter that traps debris in the system and changing this filter is part of a complete service. Most transmission filters are located on the bottom of the valve body and are clearly visible once the transmission oil pan has been removed. Look for the white or yellow plastic mesh on the bottom of the filter.

Some filters merely snap into place or are held on by clips. Pay attention to the location and orientation of the clips. It may be helpful to take a picture before removing to use as a reference.
Other filters are held in place by bolts that can vary in length. It is imperative these bolts are reinstalled in their correct locations.


Other transmissions employ external spin-on filters that resemble engine oil filters. Remove the filter with oil filter pliers and simply tighten the new one by hand.
Apply a little clean transmission fluid on any o-rings or seals on the filter as this will make installation much easier.

, Work cleanly, slowly and carefully and this will be easy.


Apply a light coat of high-tack gasket sealant to the transmission oil pan and then carefully place the gasket on the pan, lining up the holes on the gasket with the holes on the pan. Allow the sealant to set-up a few minutes so the gasket won't shift during installation. RTV silicone is NOT recommended for this application.
Carefully reinstall the transmission pan on the transmission and reinstall the bolts. Tighten the bolts in accordance with manufacturer's specifications.

, Remove the jackstands and lower the vehicle.

, Typically the transmission dipstick is red in color, while the engine oil dipstick is yellow but always refer to your owner’s manual. The dipstick tube usually doubles as the fill port. Slowly refill the transmission fluid, checking the level often to avoid overfilling. A long funnel will make this easier.

, Let the engine idle for a few minutes and look for leaks. It is a good idea to move the selector lever through all positions as well.

, Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual for exact instructions on how to check the fluid level. This is very important because some vehicles require you to check the transmission fluid with the engine running and others do not. Following the wrong procedure may result in an inaccurate dipstick reading. Ensure you’re using the right procedure and the level is correct and you’re all done!

Avoid ever trying this.,
Turn the ignition to ""on"" position, and unlock the steering wheel and release the brake.,
Have the gear stick in first, and turn the key to start the car.,
Drive and accelerate as normal.

,
Shift by moving the gear stick out of first and push it into second.,
Turn the engine off when you come to a stop.

",How to Drive a Manual With a Broken Clutch Pedal," This can, and most likely would, damage your gearbox and starter motor.
, Put the car in reverse or first gear. Steer as needed. Turn the key to ""start"" position and back off quickly — the car will jump a little. Keep doing that until you get out of the parking spot and lined up to drive away.

, It will hop, but it should start.

,, It will take a little effort, and will probably grind, but there is a sweet spot where it will just slip in.


To shift up to the next gear, drive about 500-1000 rpm above the slow speed, and shift it into the next higher gear.
To downshift, pull it to neutral, out of gear, give it a bit of a rev and slot it into gear. This is much harder than up-shifting, but it is doable.

Believe in yourself.,The year and model was a 1984 Saab 900 turbo to answer some of the questions.,
Get rid of all the stuff in your way.- open the hood and disconnect the windshield washer hose near the right headlight.,
Never hesitate- you will get depressed and look for a tow rope- your screwdriver will remove the three big air supply tubes for the engine.,
While you are now aware of where the turbo is- stuff a small rag in the hole with the fan and remove the plastic ""air in"" line.,
Last of the tubes is the carb heat.,
Stand back and look at the progress you've made.,
Now find the Allen head screws that hold the plastic cover over the clutch.,
This is important---The pressure plate will not go on just any way.,
Now we loosen the pressure plate.,

Now you can put your alignment dowels in place and start the pressure plate bolts.,Your photos notes and a trail of bread crumbs will guide you back to a running automobile.",How to Change a Saab 900 Clutch," This may take days, obtaining the parts will. Your only requirement is to be able to fit an open end wrench on a bolt without bleeding. This article was originally written after trying to find some one who was knowledgeable of the task with no results. So- with a bit of shade tree knowledge and knowing what parts you throw out- read ""ya don't have to be so careful with those"" This article has blossomed into a real useful instruction with the help of some very knowledgeable editors.
,, Cut the hose if it is stuck. If you can't find it have a person standing by with a cutter as you remove the hood. Put a blanket on the roof of the car and put the hood there(upside-down) It will serve as a nice big bucket to put the big stuff it., Got a digital camera and a magic marker? Label them and put arrows on them so you do not try to put them out of order or pointing in the wrong direction. Put the big aluminum one and the rubber ones in the hood. Gently reach inside the turbo (that is the piece the aluminum tube came from near the exhaust)and see if the little fan inside is free to spin. If it is- you just saved $600. If not time to call an expert. If you got this far, you have proved to the world that you can run a screwdriver, and a 10 mm wrench., -some have a sensor which you can leave attached, but you will need to release either end of the little hose that attaches to it. If any rubber hoses give you trouble on a Saab- cut them-they are much cheaper than the part they are attached to. Once on the bench you can slit them with a razor and peel them off the offending part., This covers the clutch and can be removed from the air cleaner and pulled from the heat source, (the exhaust manifold) Toss everything in the hood and go save your pictures., See it's not so hard. Next pull the electric fans. They have three phillips head screws (The bottom one is usually missing) and a wire connector. All into the hood., Without malice pull and fold the cover away from the car., Take some nail polish and carb spray. Clean any old spot of the flywheel and the clutch plate. Put alignment dots on them. Even if you are discarding the old clutch plate, you can align the bolt holes and dowel pin holes and transfer the location to the new clutch plate. This will keep you from spinning the new clutch plate looking for the correct place for it., Take one bolt out and replace it with a longer bolt(I steal one from the plastic cover). Skip a bolt and replace the next one and then again- you now have three long bolts not holding any thing and three short ones. The clutch bolts are special- put them in a can. Remove the last three short bolts a little at a time (if you are using the pressure plate over- not recommended). Now the pressure plate is loose and hanging on the long bolts., It is run by brake fluid. Remove the pressure line and put the end in a plastic bag to keep brake fluid from leaking everywhere., With the bits out of the way -look for the stub shaft that transfers power from the clutch to the transmission. It is under a plastic cover held on with an odd looking spring bail wire. Pop off the spring and inside is a white plastic ""X"" threaded into the end of the shaft.-Remove it. If you just try to pry it out, it will poke a hole in the radiator (you noticed how close it is). There is a hole in the end which you can thread a clutch bolt through a piece of tube you might have laying around which is bigger than the shaft and with a washer as an anvil will pull the shaft out of the clutch plate and crankshaft without harming the radiator-or you can take the radiator out. When loose slide it as far forward as it will go without removing completely as it holds the drive top sprocket. If you are doing that seal (recommended) you will need a wedge to hold the drive chain on the bottom sprocket. I used a piece of wood with a plumbers tape screwed on it for retrieval., 2)slave cylinder is away. 3)drive shaft is out of your way and the chain and sprocket scared you when it fell. NOW, Using a screwdriver or two keep the components away from the dowels. Remove the last three long bolts from the pressure plate and force the clutch and pressure plat out of their snug little home., Take the old parts to the store and remove the new pieces from their box while at the store. Our new slave cylinder had a big spring inside a rubber bellows which we discarded and used 3M cement to hold the bellows in place. Have the flywheel machined.,, Clean the oil off it with soap and water. Do not reinstall all of the alignment dowels. They will be in the way of the clutch installation. Line up the marks and use the original hardened bolts with thread locker glue and torque them down to (?????). If new bolts are available- use them -but only from the factory.,, If you have none- borrow some from your helper. Take a short piece of all thread and nut one end. Find a washer that will not pass through the splines of the clutch disc. Put it in a vise, pointing up. Load the disc with the flywheel side down. Set the pressure plate on top of the disc. Find or fabricate a washer to go on top of the ""fingers"" of the pressure plate. Slowly tighten the big washer down on the pressure plate forming a compressed pressure plate sandwich. Cut the all thread off with enough length left to slowly release the pressure when you're done. This operation will allow the clutch pack to slide into position without scoring the disc. If it is a real tight fit, you may adjust the all thread deeper into the crank or further into the throw out bearing. You may remove an alignment dowel with a vice grips- if you chose not to have it resurfaced (bad idea)., Extract the all thread through the front drive sprockets and the big washer from in front of the throw out bearing., Use the short output shaft with the splines on it to align the clutch disc. It feeds through the drive sprocket and throw out bearing., Put them all in loosely. This will tell you if your lined up right. Tighten them to collapse the pressure plate in a cross pattern. When all the clutch plate is against the flywheel, you may torque them down to (?????).,"

Be aware of your clutch's action.,
Notice if you smell something burning coming from under the hood.,
Push down on the clutch pedal.,
Check the clutch fluid level.,
Take the car for a drive.",How to Diagnose a Slipping Clutch in Your Car," Although a clutch/pressure plate system wears gradually over time, eventually the clutch's performance may become noticeably diminished, and by paying close attention to how it engages, slippage should be apparent to a competent driver. Here are some simple signs to watch for:


Change in engine speed without noticeable acceleration. If you rev your engine and the car hesitates before accelerating, it can mean your clutch isn't delivering the boost in RPM through the transmission to the drive wheels.
Change in the clutch pedal height where the driver feels the clutch begin to engage.
Change in perceived engine power when pulling a load. A slipping clutch reduces the amount of power delivered to the drive wheels.;
, This may be the result of an oil leak or even damaged electrical wiring (both serious, but not clutch-related issues), but it can also be a sign of a slipping clutch.

, Your clutch may need to be replaced if it takes only a little of the pedal movement to disengage it. There should be an inch or two (2 to 4 cm) of free movement of the pedal before the clutch starts to disengage. If it disengages sooner, this is an indicator that your clutch is not riding (i.e., is not partially disengaged) when the pedal is not depressed.

, Check the clutch fluid reservoir, which is located near the brake master cylinder. The reservoir should either be filled to the top, or somewhere between the minimum and maximum lines shown on the reservoir. If necessary, add fluid to the reservoir.


Some vehicles use the brake master cylinder for the clutch. If this is the case, make sure there is brake fluid in the master cylinder.

, See if it takes more RPMs from the engine to achieve a certain speed. This can also be an indicator your car needs a clutch replacement.


While driving down the road in 3rd gear, put the car in 2nd gear, then let out the clutch. If the RPMs of the engine don't immediately go up, it may be time to replace the clutch.






Another way to establish if your clutch needs repair is to test it in a parking lot. Drive with the car in 3rd or 4th gear and, with your foot still on the accelerator, push the clutch in and release it. It should immediately come down in RPM. If the RPMs do not come down when you release, that means your clutch is worn out and slipping.

Also verify that your model is equipped with a timing chain and not a timing belt. These two parts perform the same task, but replacing them can be quite different. This procedure is only for replacing a timing chain.;
, Having your engine clean allows you to better locate any leaks or worn parts. It also makes the job less messy overall. Never clean or work on your engine while it is hot.Keep in mind that the degreaser and oils you are washing off of your engine can kill your grass and pose an environmental threat. This should be done somewhere that is properly set up to drain and filter the chemicals used., This may be stamped directly on the engine (either on the cylinder head, valve covers, or intake manifold) and sometimes listed in the owner’s manual specifications.You can also use a service manual to determine firing order.This will be necessary to know because later you will need to check your number one cylinder (the one that fires first in the firing order).

, You should not work on your engine with the battery plugged in. First remove the ground cable (negative terminal) and then remove the positive terminal.

, This will allow the coolant to be drained from the system.

, The drain cock is located near the bottom of the radiator and is a plastic screw or pull cap that you can release. Engine coolant is a mix of water and antifreeze. It is very toxic and should be stored in a plastic container with a screw-on cap. An old antifreeze bottle is ideal., Trace the radiator hoses from the radiator back to the engine. Squeeze the hose clamps with pliers and slide them back onto the hose. Wiggle the hose to break it free and move it out of the way.


There is no need to remove the radiator. The hoses need to be loosened and the coolant drained for the purpose of removing the water pump in a later step.

, This can usually be found posted underneath the hood of your car or in your service manual for serpentine belts (S-belts). If you drive a much older car, you may have a multi-belt design (V-belt). Either way, if you cannot find a routing diagram you should take a picture or draw one before removing the belt(s).

, For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner. Some tensioners can be compressed with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. V-belts can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension.

, Once tension is released, the belt should slide off of the other pulleys easily.

, If your model has heater hoses attached to the water pump, loosen the hose clamps with a screwdriver and slide them back onto the hose.Wiggle the hose and pull it off of the water pump.

, Take out any bolts that hold the water pump to the engine. Usually there are three to five bolts to remove. Once the bolts are removed, you should be able to pull the pump off with your hands., Remove the bolt and washer in the center of the pulley. Put the bolt partially back in the bolt hole and use a harmonic balancer removal tool. The tool should not be a jaw type tool, but instead should apply all of the removal force to the center of the assembly. This protects the rubber ring in the harmonic balancer., Unbolt the timing chain cover from the engine block. Note that the bolts are different lengths so have a system in place to remember which bolt goes where when you put the cover back on. One good method is to put them back into their proper holes in the timing chain cover and set it off to the side.

, These gears are connected by the timing chain so that the position of the piston (connected to the crankshaft) correlates directly to the opening of the fuel and exhaust valves (operated by the camshaft) to keep your engine running smoothly. These gears should each be marked to help you reference their relative position.

, These links are brighter than the other links and are used to align your engine.

, To get your engine to top dead center, line the bright links on the timing chain up with the marks on your camshaft and crankshaft gears.Remember that the crankshaft can be set to top dead center both on the compression and exhaust strokes of the piston.You want top dead center for the compression stroke, so you can insert

, This can be done by loosening the tension gear with a wrench or ratchet. Next slide the chain off of the gears.

, Using a little gear oil now will help to ensure that your chain and gear perform optimally for as long as possible.

, You want the bright links on the new chain to line up exactly with the marks on the gears just like the old chain did. This will allow you to locate top dead center if you ever need to.

, Some chains are tensioned by adjusting either the crankshaft gear or the camshaft gear, while others have an automatic tensioner. This will vary by make and model of your car. The important thing is to make sure that your timing belt is as tight as it should be.

, This is the rubber seal around the crankshaft and the timing cover.

, The seal should be seated into the correct place on the timing cover. It will seal when the cover is bolted onto the engine.

, It is necessary to coat the seal with oil to ensure proper functioning when the seal is compressed., The bolts are varying lengths. Remember the system you set up to keep track of which bolts went where and be sure to use the proper bolt in the proper location.

, There is only the one bolt in the center that fastens the harmonic balancer into place. Check you owner’s manual or service guide for proper torque specifications.

, Replace the bolts that fasten the water pump to the engine block.

, If you removed heater hoses from your water pump, you will need to slide them back onto the water pump. Once the hose is on the pump you can squeeze down the hose clamp with pliers and slide it up over where the hose and pump connect. If the clamp has a tightening screw, tighten it with a screwdriver. This will secure the hose to the pump.

, If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator.

, If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner’s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says “cool” or “cold” on the tank. If your coolant is clean and relatively new, you can pour the old coolant back into your radiator.

, You should use the routing diagram stamped on your hood or printed in your owner’s manual to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt., This can be done by releasing the tensioner in a serpentine design. If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. A good rule of thumb is that the belt should have a maximum of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of movement in the middle of the belt's longest run.Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic.

, You do not want to start your engine without all of the appropriate accessories hooked up. Take a second look over everything and make sure that all is well before moving on.

, Connect the positive cable first, and then connect the ground cable.

, Turn the key and start the engine.

, Look under your hood and under your car to make sure that no fluid is dripping or leaking. If you are leaking coolant, check to make sure all hoses are connected properly to the radiator and water pump. If you are leaking oil you might have to replace the crankshaft seal again.

, This ensures that all cylinders are firing at the correct time and that the valves are opening and closing properly in relation to the piston’s position.

Start your car.,
Without actually driving the car, depress the brake and run the transmission through all the gears, including Reverse and Overdrive.,
With your car parked on an even surface, open the hood and identify your transmission dipstick.,
Pull the dipstick out and wipe it with a rag.,
Stick the dipstick back into the transmission fluid and lift it out again for your reading.,
Keep your car's engine idle with the transmission in park and the parking brake activated.,
Check the owner's manual for instructions on adding the correct transmission fluid for your vehicle.,
Place a funnel in the dipstick hole of the transmission.,
Pour the correct fluid slowly into the transmission.,
With your vehicle still idling, depress the brake and run the transmission through its gears.,
Check the fluid level once more.,
Return the dipstick to the transmission hole and make sure it is on tight.",How to Add Transmission Fluid," In order to get an accurate transmission fluid reading, you will need to check it while your transmission is running and the fluid is warm. Keep your car in park, with the handbrake on, while you check the transmission fluid. Note that some vehicles are checked in the neutral position. Reference your owner's manual for the proper position of your car's shifter.









If you've just finished driving your car around for 30 minutes or longer, it's a good idea to let your engine idle a few minutes before you check the trans fluid.This will allow the temperature of the fluid to normalize the operating condition.
Note that some cars may also have a ""cold"" reading on the transmission dipstick. Even if this is the case in your vehicle, you should still turn your engine on and get the trans fluid heated up in order to get an accurate reading.;
, If you check the trans fluid cold — i.e. not having driven anywhere and not having run through all the transmission gears — inspection of the transmission dipstick will give you an inaccurate reading. It will appear as if you have far too much transmission fluid in your car. To avoid this, cycle through all the gears in your car to help circulate the transmission fluid evenly.








, Remember to set the parking brake, especially if you're leaving the car in neutral. On some cars, it is easy to mistake the transmission dipstick for the crankcase oil dipstick, so make sure you are clear on the location of your transmission.









Look towards the back of the engine, near the firewall. This is where the transmission is located on most cars with rear-wheel drive.On cars with front-wheel drive, the transmission dipstick is usually located in the front of the engine, connected to the transaxle. This isn't universally true, however, so you should look in your owner's manual or for labels around and on the dipstick to see which one it is., This will help give you an accurate reading.








, You should now be able to see what level your transmission fluid reaches. Remember to read the ""hot"" level on the transmission dipstick.








, Your car's engine should be running when you add fluid to the transmission, but you want to have the transmission in park and the handbrake activated for safety reasons.

, This will tell you what type of transmission fluid to use, and whether there are special instructions for adding fluid.









The transmission dipstick itself might also tell you what kind of transmission fluid the transmission takes. Note that there are several different kinds, each with specifications that make it favorable for that engine's transmission.
Also look for instructions on how frequently to change your transmission fluid. While you can add fluid when it gets low, many car manufacturers recommend a transmission fluid change every 30,000 to 100,000 miles (48,000 to 161,000 km), depending on your car.

, It will need to be a fairly long funnel to ensure you do not overfill.








, Add a little at a time so you do not overfill. How much transmission fluid do you add to your vehicle? It depends on what you're doing:









Are you topping off fluid level? If you notice the transmission fluid is a little low on the dipstick, start with a half a quart to a quart of transmission fluid. Recheck the level and add 1/4 quart at a time till the level is up to the full or max mark.
Are you doing a transmission service, where you drop the pan and replace the filter? This kind of service regularly needs 4 to 5 quarts of transmission fluid in order to replace what was lost in the pan.
Are you replacing the entire transmission fluid? It could take anywhere from 9 to 13 quarts of transmission fluid to adequately replace the entire transmission fluid.

, This will help circulate all of the transmission fluid and make sure you're getting the correct reading.








, You may not need to add more transmission fluid, but if you do, you'll want to add the fluid gradually rather than pouring all at once. Again, most vehicles will not need more than 1 pint (0.5 liter).








, You will need to turn it until it locks or press down a latch on the top of the dipstick to lock it into place.

Slide the jack beneath one of the vehicles front jack points and either raise and lower or turn the handle (depending on the style of jack) to lift it off of the ground high enough to work beneath.Always place jack stands beneath a vehicle you work on.
You can find the designated jack points for your vehicle in the owner’s manual.;
, Brake fluid can be an irritant for your eyes and skin. Before you start working with it, put on gloves and safety glasses to help protect you from any brake fluid that may leak or drip onto you while you work.Because you will be working under the vehicle, you may want to use goggle style eye protection instead of traditional safety glasses.
Neoprene or latex gloves will prevent your hands from getting covered in brake fluid.

, Cut a to eight to ten-inch length of clear hose with a 1/8 inch inside diameter. Insert one end into an empty soda bottle. This will serve as your brake fluid catch can once you begin the bleeding process.The hose will direct the path of the brake fluid you drain from the system.
The bottle will catch the brake fluid as it drains.

, It is integral that you refill the brake master cylinder with the correct type of brake fluid as you flush the old fluid out of the slave cylinder. You can find what kind of fluid to purchase in your vehicle’s owner’s manual or sometimes it’s written on the top of the master cylinder reservoir in your engine bay.You can ask the clerk at your local auto parts store to look up the correct type of brake fluid for your application.
Using the wrong kind of brake fluid could damage the system or cause it to fail.

, Open the cap to the brake fluid reservoir on the master cylinder and check the level of the fluid inside. The fluid should reach the full line on the reservoir. If it doesn’t, add fluid to it to ensure there is enough to keep the system from sucking air in as you bleed it.It’s okay if you overfill the reservoir, as you will be draining a good amount of fluid from the system in the bleeding process.

, The slave cylinder in your vehicle should be located in close proximity to the transmission, though its exact mounting location will vary from application to application. You will find the bleed screw on the bottom or the underside of the slave cylinder. It looks like a bolt with a nozzle sticking out of it.If you have difficulty locating the slave cylinder or bleed screw, refer to the service manual for your vehicle.

, Press a clear hose onto the slave cylinder bleed screw and place the other end in an empty soda bottle. This will control the direction the released brake fluid will travel in as you bleed the system and provide a container to catch it in.Ensure the hose is securely pressed onto the nozzle.
Set the soda bottle down on a flat surface like the ground or a box to ensure it doesn’t tip over.

, Use an open ended wrench to turn the bleed screw counter clockwise with the hose attached to it. This will open the system and allow fluid to be pressed through into the hose.Be sure to leave the hose attached to the nozzle at all times to avoid spilling brake fluid.
Leave the screw open for now.

, With the bleed screw open and the hose in place, have a friend press the clutch pedal down to the floor and hold it there. It is extremely important that your friend not let the pedal release until you close the bleed screw, so be sure you tell them so.As your friend presses the pedal downward, brake fluid will be drained into the bottle through the hose on the bleed screw.
Make sure you are positioned so you can see the fluid draining through the hose.

, With your friend pressing the clutch pedal to the floor, use the open ended wrench to turn the bleed screw clockwise to tighten it again. This will once again seal the hydraulic clutch system, preventing air from getting sucked back into the system through the bleed screw.If your friend releases the pedal before you close the bleed screw, air will be sucked into the system, making the bleeding process significantly longer.
Don’t overtighten the bleed screw, as you will need to open and close it repeatedly.

, With the bleed screw closed, have your friend release the clutch pedal. Once the pedal is all the way back to the top of its clutch throw, you can begin the bleeding process once again to remove the remainder of the air bubbles in the system.Be sure the pedal has been released completely before you open the bleed valve again.

, One round of bleeding the slave cylinder is complete when your friend lifts their foot off of the clutch pedal. With the bleed valve closed and your friend’s foot off of the pedal, open the brake fluid reservoir on the master cylinder and add brake fluid to it to ensure it doesn’t run dry as you go.Bleeding the slave cylinder with an empty reservoir will suck air into the system again.
Check the reservoir regularly to ensure it does not run out of fluid.

, As your friend presses on the clutch pedal, look at the clear hose so you can see any debris or air bubbles that drain with the fluid. Air bubbles may look like bubbles, or they may look like gaps in the fluid as it passes through the hose. When there are no air bubbles for a few round of bleeding, you are finished.Air bubbles in the system can lead to your clutch system only delivering intermittent pressure.
Intermittent pressure in the clutch system can cause the clutch to fail to engage.

, Do as many rounds of bleeding the clutch as necessary for the bubbles to stop coming out of the hose. If bubbles continue to appear no matter how much you bleed the system, there may be a leak somewhere in the lines or at the master cylinder.Once the bubbles stop coming you can seal the bleed screw and place the cap back on the reservoir.
If there is a leak somewhere in the system, you will need to seek a professional to identify and repair it.

Keep your car properly maintained by doing all of the scheduled maintenance in a timely manner.,
If the Check Engine Light ever comes on, take your car to a qualified repair shop to have the problem properly diagnosed and repaired.,
Make sure that your car idles smooth and drives properly.,
Be sure that your gas cap fits properly.,
Have a good quality battery installed.,
Have a smog pre-test performed if you have any real doubts about your car passing.,
Take your car to a licensed emissions technician for any needed repairs.,
Consider driving your car for about 20 minutes on the freeway before taking the smog test.",How to Know if Your Car Will Pass Smog," Changing your oil, air filter, and performing tune-ups is critical in order for your car to run properly and efficiently.;
, The purpose of the Check Engine light is to warn you that your emission control system is malfunctioning and that your vehicle is releasing harmful emissions that is 150% over the EPA allowed maximum limit. While your car is in this state it can put extra wear on the catalytic converter and could cause other more expensive problems!



Note: No car will pass a smog test if the Check Engine light is on. If you take your car in for a test with the Check Engine light on, you will fail. Be sure to take your car to the mechanic when the light turns on, and before taking it in for a test so you don't waste your time.







, Any roughness in the performance of the engine will have an impact on the results of your smog test. Also, if your car smokes or over-heats, you may not pass the smog inspection. Smoke from the tailpipe and a hot running engine create high levels of harmful emissions.

, If there is any doubt about your gas cap, get a new fuel cap from the dealership only; many after-market fuel caps don't comply with the factory specifications and could cause more problems than they are worth.

, If you have to jump-start your car on any type of regular basis, you may fail the smog test computer OBD-II self-test section.

, This is a genuine smog test but is done off-line so the state does not ""see it."" If there is any problem, you can resolve it without being ""tagged"" by the state whereby you may have to get into a long bureaucratic process in order to get your car to pass smog.


Simply take your car to a smog test station and ask if they can provide a ""Pre-Test.""






They will charge you the same cost for a pre test as a regular test (minus certification), but you may save a lot of money compared to being flagged as a polluter.






If you are flagged as a ""gross polluter,"" you will have to go to a ""STAR"" repair station that will cost you considerably more money than a regular repair station. If you think there is any risk of being flagged as a gross polluter, do the pre test first.



, Though your regular shop may be qualified to do your scheduled maintenance, emissions repair is very technical and requires years of training. More and more states require a four-year degree in automotive technology to become an emissions repair tech. The mechanic will also have to be licensed by the state to become certified.

, Doing this makes sure that the catalytic converter is completely warmed up. When you get to the testing center, don't shut your car off; stay with it and let it idle so the emission controls system stays warm. Many cars fail the smog test because the car sat for 30 minutes and cooled off before being tested.


If you have to sit in a long line at the test center then put your car in park and hold your RPM’s up to about 1200 to 1500 just before it is your turn. This will burn off any excess fuel from extended idling. Some cars also have the new auto stop and will shut off your engine at stops.

Know the risks of a defective muffler.,
Listen to the sound of your vehicle.,
Use a car jack to raise the car so you can examine the muffler.,
Look for water dripping from the muffler.,
Check the temperature of the engine after the car has run a while.,
Take your car to a mechanic if you suspect your car has a defective muffler.

",How to Know When a Muffler Is Broken,"


If the muffler has a hole, it can cause dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide to leak into the cabin of a vehicle. This colorless, odorless gas is a product of the combustion process. Mild exposure to carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Prolonged carbon monoxide exposure can lead to unconsciousness and death.
Many homeowners' associations, cities, restaurants, and apartment complexes have laws against loud noises from defective mufflers. If you have a broken muffler, you may face fines or refusal of service until you get the muffler fixed.
A damaged muffler can cause a car trip to be noisy and uncomfortable.;
, A broken muffler may cause the car to have a louder sound than before. Thumping or clunking may indicate that something is broken in the exhaust system.


Some mufflers contain baffles to reduce the noise of the exhaust system. These may become broken or loose and cause rattling in a muffler.

, Inspect the muffler for any holes and rust. Visible rust on the outside may indicate an even worse problem on the inside of the muffler.


Minor surface rust may be normal if it does not penetrate the metal.

, Although condensation in a muffler does occur and some manufacturers include a small drain hole in the muffler therefore, water dripping from several places may indicate that holes have formed from rust.

, If the car overheats, it may mean there are problems with your car's exhaust system. If the muffler is damaged or has come apart, this could cause a partial blockage and cause the engine to overheat or lose power.

Lift the car.,
Lie on your back and position yourself under the car.,
Assess the condition of all the parts of your exhaust system before beginning.,
Plan to order all needed parts.,
Order and receive your parts.,
Dry assemble and visually test fit all of the needed parts.,
Unbolt the stock exhaust system starting from the back of the car and working your way forward.,
Remove the exhaust components you're going to replace.,
Starting from the front of the car, hang the exhaust part up then bolt it onto the upstream pipe.,
Start tightening each segment to the first, after all pipes are attached.,
Take a few steps back and make any alignment adjustments you need so that the tailpipes are even with the bumper and look good, when you get to the back.








,
Double check and tighten all the bolts.








,
Start the car up and locate any leaks you may have.








",How to Install an Exhaust System," If you don't have a lift, jack up the back end so you can get under it. Use ramps or a jack, whichever you have.


Be sure to lock the emergency brake and chock at least one wheel that is still on the ground.
Make sure to block the car using jack stands, wooden blocks or other sturdy blocks. Never use just a jack; the car may fall on you.
Check the stability of your setup. If there is any doubt that your jack/block configuration is stable, adjust your setup.;
, Examine the situation and imagine what you will replace and how you will get it off of the car. Look for obstructions to the removal process.








, You may need to begin at the exhaust manifold, the crossover pipe, or the catalytic converter.








, Don't forget gaskets for between the components. If you are unsure about all that you might need, ask at your local auto parts store or find a model-specific exploded diagram of your exhaust system in a repair manual or online.








, Don't forget gaskets for between the components, penetrating oil, and hangers.








, Lay everything out and visually test fit the assembly as accurately as possible. Try to identify and correct problems before you take off the old exhaust system.








, Generally, the bolts are rusted and hard to get off unless you have an impact gun. Use some penetrating oil to aid removal and remember that, sometimes, tightening a nut or bolt just a bit, breaks it free, allowing your to remove the bolt or nut.








, Remove the system from the hangers and set all of your parts aside. You should now have all the piping removed.









If you have new hangers (recommended as stock ones are soft and old), cut the old ones off with some kind of cutting tool.-- A high-speed rotary tool fitted with a cutting disk or a side grinder will work.
Depending on the type of hangers your car has, put the new hangers onto the exhaust pieces first, this is usually an easier way to put the exhaust parts back on.

, Do not tighten all the way until you have all pieces on.









If you don't have new gaskets to put between the pipe segments, you can use the old ones if they're the right diameter. It's best to have new ones,though, to prevent exhaust leaks later.

, Use a good amount of torque on each bolt to make sure its tight.

Insert the key.,
Rotate the key to the left.,
Lift the cap away.",How to Install a Gas Cap," Grab your new gas cap and unwind the leash by rotating it around the cap in a clockwise direction.


The leash should spin around the gas cap very easily.
Use a high-quality gas cap. A good gas cap is safer and more fuel-efficient. Moreover, quality gas caps will have a leash on them that can connect to your car.;
, Press the locking peg at the end of the leash into the hole in the door of your fuel tank.The door protecting your fuel tank should be open. Look near the hinge of this door for a leash hole. The vast majority of cars will have a hole set aside for this purpose.
Press the locking peg into the hole from the top of that hole. It should make an audible ""snap"" as it locks into place.
If your car does not have a hole for the leash, you will need to use a gas cap that doesn't have an attached leash.

, Insert the gas cap into the opening of the fuel tank, then rotate it clockwise until it feels secure.


This new gas cap should twist into place just as the old one did. Continue rotating it until the cap either ""clicks"" closed or otherwise refuses to move any further.
Once the leash and cap are both in place, the process is complete.

, Insert the new cap into the opening of the fuel tank. Rotate the cap in a clockwise direction until you hear three audible clicks.The fuel cap will make these clicks as its ratchets click onto the filler neck. This must happen three separate times for the gas cap to be secured.
Note that the key should not be inserted into the gas cap as you install it.

, Try to turn the cap to the left. It should not budge.


The gas cap should be locked into place after you install it. Only the key should be able to release it.
After testing the gas cap, you have finished the installation process.

, Insert the push-on locking cap directly into the filler neck of the fuel tank. Continue pushing until you hear an audible click.


The key must not be in the fuel cap as you install it.
When the fuel cap clicks, the lock bars of the cap have engaged under the lip of the filler neck. These lock bars should hold the cap in place.

, Unlike other fuel cap types, you do not need to turn the cap to lock it in place. Attempting to turn the cap could damage it if you apply too much force.


It is a good idea to test the cap after you install it, however. Wiggle it slightly back and forth. It should not move much and should not lift away.
At this point, the fuel cap is fully installed and ready to use.

, Rotate the gas cap counter-clockwise until you are able to lift it away from the opening of the fuel tank.Set the old gas cap aside. Keep it until you have installed a new cap. If the new cap does not fit your fuel tank for some reason, you should cover the fuel tank opening with the old cap until a better replacement can be found.

, If the leash is still connected to the gas cap and the fuel door, you will need to remove that, as well.


It can remain attached to the fuel cap, but you must locate the locking peg attached to the opposite end of the leash and pop it out of the hole in the fuel door.
Press up on the bottom of the locking peg until it unsnaps from its place in the door hinge.
After removing the gas cap and the attached leash, you can install a new cap.

, Insert the gas cap key into keyhole on the handle of the cap.


You will not be able to remove an old locking gas cap without first using the key to unlock it.

, Turn the key in a counter-clockwise motion to unlock the gas cap. You should only twist the key one-quarter of a turn; do not twist it any further than that.


Hold the gas cap still as you turn the key.
For quick-on locking caps, you can proceed directly to the next step after unlocking the cap.
For pre-vent (pressure release) locking caps, you must allow the pressure to release before continuing. Listen for the sound of hissing. Wait for several seconds until the hissing stops completely before moving onto the next step.

, Grab the gas cap handle and continue turning the cap counter-clockwise.


Do not use the key to rotate the cap.
Continue to twist the cap until it is completely loose. At that point, you should be able to lift the gas cap away and set it aside. It is a good idea to keep this old gas cap until after you are certain that the new gas cap fits.

, Once the gas cap has been removed, you can remove the key by rotating it one-quarter turn to the right and pulling it straight out.


After you complete this step, you should be ready to install a new gas cap.

, Fit the gas cap key into the keyhole located on the outside of the cap.


You'll need to use the key to unlock the old cap before you can remove it.

, Twist the key one-quarter turn in a counter-clockwise direction.


This action unlocks the gas cap. As you rotate the key, the lock bars inside of the cap should retract, freeing the cap from its usual place.
Hold the cap still with one hand as you unlock it.

, The cap should be completely free at this point. Remove it by simply lifting it away from the neck of opening of the fuel tank.


Keep the old cap until you are certain that the replacement cap fits and can be installed properly.
After lifting the old cap away, you can install a new gas cap.

Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment for the task.,
Locate the vehicle on a flat surface, preferably a concrete driveway, since asphalt can be damaged if you spill fuel on it.,
Make sure you have access to repair parts before beginning this project.,
Try to get help before beginning this project.",How to Drop a Gas Tank1," There are many different fasteners, clamps, and connections that must be removed or loosened to remove a fuel tank. Here are some:

Strap bolts, usually requiring a 1⁄2 or 9⁄16 inch (1.3 or 1.4 cm) or 12, 13, or 14 mm open end wrench.
Slotted and Phillips screwdrivers for hose clamps.
Special tools for disconnecting fuel line fittings.
Other items you may need include a jack, jack stands, a pump for removing the fuel, fuel rated containers for fuel that is removed from the tank, rags, and a fire extinguisher in case of an emergency.;
, Hard, compacted soil is acceptable if no other option is available., Submersible fuel pumps are usually readily available from a local auto parts supplier, but fuel level sensing units may require special ordering from a dealer., Even an empty gas tank can be heavy and difficult to manage while lying underneath a vehicle. It is also better to have an assistant to hand you tools, and to respond if you have an accident while performing this task."
"Remove the ground cable of your battery to avoid sparks before continuing with this step.,
Make sure the container you are draining the fuel into is large enough to hold it all.,Locate the proper adapter for your car's drainpipe or filler hose, if necessary, and connect the intake hose from an air or hand pump to the pipe.,
Place the discharge hose of the pump into the gas container.",How to Drop a Gas Tank2,", Most fuel tanks have a 12 to 20 gallon (45.4 to 75.7 L) capacity, so if your fuel gauge is working properly, you can estimate the amount of fuel in your tank. Get the EPA/Underwriter's Laboratory approved gas container ready below your car in a position to catch the draining fuel. Remove the drain plug if your car has one, being careful not to allow the fuel to spill on your person when it begins to drain.

If your car doesn't have a drain bolt, find your tank's drainpipe or filler hose.

,, Use the pump to extract all of the fuel. Seal any openings so vapors cannot escape."
"Chock the front wheels of the car, making sure it can't roll while you are raising it or working underneath it.,
Lift your vehicle with a hoist or a jack.",How to Drop a Gas Tank3,", You will need to raise it high enough to access the brackets or straps that secure the tank, and if the tank it to be completely removed from underneath the vehicle, you will want to be sure it is high enough the tank will clear the frame members. Once the car is lifted off the ground, support it with jack stands."

Blow compressed air to remove debris from the outside of fuel lines and wiring connectors.,
Place a work mat, a sheet of plywood, or even a scrap piece of carpet underneath the car to lay on while working for your own comfort, and to prevent the loss of fasteners, nuts, and washers if you want.,
Disconnect the fuel tank wiring harness connector from the auto body's harness connector.,
Remove the fuel lines from the gas tank.,
Wipe off the filler and vent pipes with a soft towel and disconnect their tubes to the tank.,
Unhook your filler neck.,
Locate the fastening system that holds your fuel tank in place.,
Loosen the gas tank strap bolts until they are only held on by enough threads to support it.,
Pull the gas tank support straps out from around the tank so they do not interfere with moving it.,
Remove the tank from underneath the car by dragging it sideways.",How to Drop a Gas Tank4," You might have to do this a couple of times, using a small stiff brush to loosen the accumulated debris., This will also give you something to protect the tank if you need to drag it out from underneath the vehicle., Remove the ground wire screw from the chassis if your vehicle if it is equipped with one., Sometimes you need a specialized tool to separate ""quick disconnect"" fittings. Consult your vehicle's service manual for directions on your specific type of car., Note that often, the tank must be dropped several inches before you can access these connections, so be careful they do not become fouled while doing so., There are two possible types. If yours is one piece, remove the screws around the filler neck. If it is a two or three piece assembly, loosen the clamp and remove the neoprene hose from the filler neck. Make sure the fuel hose that goes to the top of your gas tank has enough room to drop down when the tank is lowered. These are often molded assemblies, and may need to be guided while the tank is lowered to avoid obstructions and possible damage to this part., Usually, there are two straps that wrap around the fuel tank, the ends of which are adapted to bolts that fasten through a bracket mounted to the vehicle's frame. Some vehicles have two support frames similar to a trapeze with four bolts fitted through them which must be removed., Carefully lower the fuel tank to the ground as you finish loosening the bolts. You may be able to place a low profile floor jack underneath the tank to help lower it, provided you have one and the car is jacked up high enough to allow it., They are fairly flexible, but make sure you don't kink or damage them in the process., Perform the maintenance or repairs required to the tank, then reinstall it by following the previous steps in reverse order."

Park the vehicle on a level surface.,
Wait for the exhaust to cool.,
Jack the vehicle up.,
Inspect the exhaust piping.,
Start the engine to help locate leaks.,
Determine the best way to repair the damage.",How to Fix a Broken Exhaust Pipe1," In order to repair an exhaust leak, you will need to jack the vehicle up to locate it. Always jack vehicles up on flat, level surfaces to ensure the jack won’t topple over as you lift the vehicle. It is also important to ensure the surface is sturdy enough to support the weight of the vehicle beneath the jack.Black top or concrete are the best surfaces to jack up a vehicle on.
Never jack up a vehicle on an uneven surface or the car may fall off of the jack.;
, You won’t be able to work on the exhaust pipe of your vehicle until it has cooled down for a while. The exhaust gas that travels through the exhaust piping is extremely hot while the engine is running and it could take hours for the metal to cool enough to touch.Wait for a few hours then place your hand near the exhaust pipe to see if you can feel any heat radiating off the metal.
Touch the hood of your car. If it is still warm, the engine and exhaust are both still extremely hot.

, Once the exhaust is cool enough to work on, slide a scissor or trolley jack under one of the vehicle’s rear jack points. Once in place, either lift and lower the handle (trolley jack) or turn the handle (scissor jack) to jack the car up.Place jack stands beneath the vehicle to support its weight once it is jacked to the appropriate height to work on the exhaust pipe.
Never work beneath a vehicle without jack stands in place.

, If you aren’t able to easily identify the leak in the exhaust pipe, use the vantage point you gained jacking up the vehicle to visually inspect the piping and muffler. Look for signs of damage that may indicate a leak such a deep rusting, cracks, scrapes or holes.Bottoming a vehicle out can cause exhaust leaks by scraping on the road or puncturing the piping.
Rust can cause serious exhaust leaks if allowed to penetrate all the way through the steel.

, If you can’t find the leak in the exhaust pipe with a visual inspection, leave the vehicle jacked up and start the engine. With the engine running, you should be able to quickly and easily identify the source of the leak.Keep your hands away from any moving parts while working beneath a vehicle with the engine running.
Make sure the vehicle is in park (for automatic transmissions) or is in neutral with the wheels chocked (standard transmissions) before starting it while jacked up.

, If your exhaust pipe is severely rusted or has suffered extensive damage, it likely cannot be repaired and instead will need to be replaced. However, if the issue is a small leak or damaged muffler, you can patch the leak or replace the muffler using common hand tools.Small leaks can be repaired using exhaust tape or repair epoxy.
Seriously damaged exhausts may need to be cut off and replaced completely by a mechanic.

Scrub around the hole with a steel toothed brush.,
Prepare the surface of the pipe with sandpaper.,
Wipe acetone on the pipe around the leak.,
Wrap exhaust tape around the leaking portion of the pipe.,
Apply epoxy to the leak.",How to Fix a Broken Exhaust Pipe2," You won’t be able to identify the size of the leak or effectively repair it until you remove all of the road grime, dirt and rust from the pipe around the hole. Use a steel toothed brush to scrub away the grime, being careful not to get any in your eyes.Scrub the pipe all around the leak, including the top side if you can reach it.
Make sure to wear eye protection when scrubbing the piping to prevent anything from getting in your eyes.

, Sandpaper will remove any last bits of dirt and debris stuck to the pipe while scoring the steel surface to better stick when you apply the patch. Rub 80 or 100 grit sandpaper back and forth along the exhaust pipe around the leak you intend to seal.If you are using exhaust tape, make sure to scrub the top of the pipe as well.
Roughing up the surface of the metal will create a stronger bond for the patch.

, Acetone will ensure the metal is clean and free of anything that could interfere with the seal created by the exhaust tape or epoxy. Acetone is the primary ingredient in nail polish remover, so you may use nail polish remover for this step if you’d rather not purchase acetone strictly for this project.Be careful not to drip acetone in your eyes or mouth while cleaning the pipe with it.
You can purchase acetone in the cleaning chemicals section of many retail stores.

, If you are using exhaust repair tape, wrap it all the way around the part of the pipe with the leak. Continue to wrap the tape around the pipe for a few inches to either side of the leak to ensure there is a good seal. Different kinds of exhaust repair tape will require different application methods, so be sure to read the instructions before you get started.Some exhaust repair tape needs to be applied to warm pipes, so you may need to start the vehicle and let it run for a few minutes before applying.
You can purchase exhaust repair tape at most auto parts stores.

, If you are using an epoxy to seal the leak, mix the two chemicals together using a wooden dowel. It will begin to cure immediately, so apply it directly to the leak as soon as the components are thoroughly mixed. Dab the epoxy onto the leak, then use the wooden dowel to spread it around the area. Make sure to cake the epoxy over the leak and surrounding pipe so it creates a thick film on the whole area.You may also choose to wrap the leak in exhaust repair tape after applying the epoxy.
Different types of epoxy have different curing rates, so read the instructions on the package to know how long let the epoxy dry.

Spray rust penetrator on the exhaust clamps.,
Loosen the exhaust clamps with a wrench.,
Slide the exhaust and muffler apart.,
Hang the new muffler on the mounts.,
Spray exhaust sealant on the ends of both pipes.,
Slide the exhaust pipes together.,
Secure the muffler clamps onto the pipe.",How to Fix a Broken Exhaust Pipe3," If your muffler is not welded in place, it will be secured using muffler clamps. Spray a rust penetrator like WD40 onto the fastening hardware to break through some of the rust and grime that may have seized the nuts in place.You may need to spray the bolts and let them sit a few times before they are able to be loosened.
You can purchase rust penetrator at most auto parts or large retail stores.

, Once the fasteners have been thoroughly soaked in rust penetrator, use a wrench to remove the nuts holding the exhaust clamp in place. Make sure to use a socket or wrench of the correct size, as exhaust fasteners are prone to stripping or breaking.If you intend to reuse the muffler clamp, you may want to spray it with more rust penetrator as you work it loose.
You can purchase replacement muffler clamps at most auto parts stores if they are too rusty to be reused.

, Because the muffler and the piping have been held together with the exhaust clamp for so long, they may not come apart easily once the clamp is removed. Spray some rust penetrator where the two pipes meet and try to work them away from one another until they slide completely apart.If the pipes are rusted together, you may have to cut the pipes apart.
If your muffler was welded in place, you will have to cut the pipes apart.

, The muffler will have metal prongs sticking out of the top that slide into rubber eyelets below the body of the car. You may have to push the prongs through the rubber with a bit of force to get past the initial ridge. The rubber will prevent the muffler from rattling inside the cabin of the vehicle once the muffler is completely installed.There should still be enough play in the rubber mounts to allow you to move the muffler around as you connect it to the exhaust pipe.

, Spray exhaust sealant on the pipe coming from the exhaust and the pipe it will connect to on the muffler. This will help establish a seal between the pipes and prevent any exhaust from leaking at the joint.Refer to the instructions on the exhaust sealant to know how long to let it cure.
You can purchase exhaust sealant at your local auto parts store.

, Slide the pipe from the muffler over the existing exhaust pipe. The muffler should rest directly below the rubber eyelets its mounted to, so the eyelet should hang straight up and down when the pipes are joined properly. If the two pipes feel loose or can be wiggled, you will need an adaptor to match the correct size.Most exhaust piping comes in two or two-and-a-half-inch diameters.
You will not be able to seal the wrong size pipe onto another pipe, but adaptors for most diameters can be purchased at hardware or auto parts stores.

, With the piping seated properly, slide a muffler clamp over the area where the muffler pipe overlaps the other. Use a hand or socket wrench to tighten the clamp until it is not possible to move the pipes back and forth at all.You may want to use a half inch drive wrench to tighten the clamps to make sure you have enough leverage to tighten it sufficiently.
Be sure you tighten the clamp where the piping overlaps, otherwise you may not create a solid seal.

, Once you have located the correct fuse box, use the diagram provided on the fuse box cover or in the owner’s manual to identify the fuse that powers the fuel pump. Use a pair of needle nose pliers or plastic tweezers to remove the fuse.With the fuse removed, the fuel pump will not function when you start the engine.
There is still fuel and pressure in the fuel lines running from the rear to the front of the vehicle.
Check the auto maker’s website for a fuse diagram if you do not have one.

, Although the engine will not be receiving a fresh supply of fuel from the gas tank, there will be enough fuel left in the lines for it to start and run briefly. Make sure automatic vehicles are in park and vehicles equipped with a standard transmission are in neutral with the parking brake engaged.Although the vehicle will only run briefly, it will still move if left in gear.
Be sure the parking brake is engaged if you are in a standard vehicle. The parking brake is optional but advised for automatics.

, Insert the key into the ignition and turn it to start the motor just as you would any other time. The engine should start easily as it expends the fuel remaining in the fuel system past the fuel pump.If the engine turns over but then sputters out, it may not have had sufficient pressure in the lines to force the fuel into the engine.
If the engine dies, the fuel pressure will be sufficiently relieved.

, Depending on the fuel system in your vehicle and its average fuel consumption, the amount of time it will run without a functioning fuel pump can vary greatly. It does not need to run until it dies, however. Instead just allow it to run for a minute or two before turning the key back to off.Without the fuel pump functioning, the pressure will be relieved in the fuel lines fairly quickly.
Allowing the engine to run until it dies may make it difficult to start it again.

, With the pressure relieved from the fuel system and the engine off, you can re-insert the fuse that powers the fuel pump. Place the cover back on the fuse box and return any pieces of the trim you may have needed to remove to access it.Make sure the vehicle is off before replacing the fuse you removed.
Do not start the engine again after inserting the fuel pump fuse.

, Now that there is no reason for the engine to be started again until the project is complete, you should disconnect the negative terminal on the battery. Removing the cable from the negative terminal will prevent the engine from being started while you work. You will need to use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut holding the cable onto the negative terminal, but you will not need to remove the nut completely.Disconnecting the battery will ensure the engine cannot be started during the remainder of this project.
Tuck the negative cable to the side of the battery to ensure it doesn’t accidentally come into contact with its terminal on the battery.

, There are two common locations fuel filters are mounted in vehicles, so you should refer to your vehicle’s service manual to help you determine which place to look. The most common location for modern vehicles is along the fuel line on the bottom of the car, just past the fuel pump. In some vehicles, the fuel filter is located in the engine bay on the line that leads to the fuel rail.Some vehicles may place the fuel filter in a different location, so refer to your service manual to find out for sure.
You may need to access the fuel filter from inside the cabin of some vehicles.

, If the fuel filter is located on the underside of your vehicle, you will need to jack up the car to access it. Slide the jack under the car at one of its designated jack points, then either pump or twist the handle to raise the vehicle (depending on the style of jack).Once the vehicle is jacked up, place jack stands beneath it before working under the vehicle.
Never rely on a jack to support the weight of a vehicle you are beneath while working.

, Although you relieved the pressure in the fuel line, there may be a bit of fuel left in the line that can spill out when disconnected from the fuel filter. Place a bowl or bucket beneath the fuel filter to catch any fuel that drips or pours out.Do not mix the fuel with oil or coolant to be recycled. Gasoline should be held in its own container until it can be dropped off to a recycling location.
Be careful of using plastic containers to hold gas, as it may eat through some kinds of plastic and cause a leak.

, Most fuel filters are held in place by two plastic clips. Locate the clips on either side of the cylindrical fuel filter, then use a flat head screwdriver to pop them out of the holes they are in. These clips may break as you remove them, so purchasing replacement clips along with your fuel filter is advised.








The clips that hold the fuel filter in place are made of thin plastic and tend to break easily. If you are able to remove them without them breaking, they may be reused.
You can purchase replacement fuel filter clips at your local auto parts store.

, With the clips removed, slide the fuel lines away from the filter to pop them off of the nozzles on either end. Make sure to tip the fuel lines toward the bowl or bucket in place as you remove them to catch any spilled gasoline. 








You should wear eye protection and gloves during this portion of the project to protect you from fuel splatter.
Do your best to avoid allowing any gas to pour out onto the ground.

, The fuel filter is likely held in place by a metal bracket that wraps around its outer housing. With the fuel lines disconnected, you can slide the fuel filter out of the bracket by pushing it toward the front of the car. The fuel filter will have a slight bell shape, allowing it to slide out in only one direction.








If your filter sits in the bracket differently, you may need to slide it toward the back of the car to remove it.
Some fuel filters under the hood may he held in the bracket with a bolt that will need to be removed to slide the filter out.

, Before installing the new fuel filter, compare it to the one you just removed. Make sure they appear to be the same outside diameter, that the nozzles are the same size, and that it will fit into the bracket.If the fuel filters do not match, you will need to return the new one for the correct replacement filter.
Do not attempt to use a fuel filter for a different application in your vehicle, as it may not be capable of allowing the appropriate volume of fuel to pass through it.

, The new fuel filter should easily slide into its bracket. If you have to force it, it is likely not the correct diameter. The fuel filter should stop when it is seated properly, as it should only be able to slide all the way out in one direction.








Be careful not to damage the housing of the fuel filter, as that may cause a leak.
If you find yourself pushing hard on the filter to make it fit, it is likely not the correct one.

, Slide the fuel lines onto the front and back of the filter the same way they were attached to the old one. With the fuel line in place on the filter, slide the plastic clips through the holes on the fuel line nozzle to secure the line in place on the fuel filter.








If the plastic clip breaks as you slide it in, do not attempt to drive the vehicle until you replace the broken clip.
Make sure the fuel lines are snug on the nozzles of the fuel filter before sliding the clips into place.

, Jack up the car to relieve the weight on the jack stands, then slide them out from beneath the vehicle. Once the jack stands are clear, lower the vehicle to the ground by either releasing the pressure in the jack or turning the jack handle counter-clockwise, depending on your style of jack.Be sure the jack stands are completely out of the way, otherwise they may damage the vehicle if lowered onto them.
Once the vehicle is safely on the ground, reconnect the battery to complete the project.

Purchase a new muffler hanger.,
Install your muffler if you have just purchased a new one or make sure it is installed properly if it is already installed.,
Remove any old muffler hangers from the top mount and the muffler itself.,
Install the muffler hanger.,
Use a crescent wrench that has a hole at the end of its handle to hang the muffler.",How to Hang a Muffler," Also called muffler straps, muffler hangers are thick rubber loops. Your exhaust system may require more than 1 hanger, so look underneath the car to see if it requires any additional muffler hangers. Buy replacements for any that are broken or weakened.;
, Let the muffler rest on a floor jack while you get the hanger ready in the following steps.

, Some hangers might be constructed into 2 pieces, so make sure to remove all parts of the hanger.

, First hang it from the top exhaust mount, which is attached to the bottom of your car. Let the muffler hanger dangle temporarily.

, Pull up the muffler closer to the top exhaust mount so you can hook them together. Slide the handle through the muffler hanger, and hook the handle hole onto the exhaust mount located on the muffler. Slide the rubber muffler hanger along the wrench handle, and hook it over the muffler's exhaust mount.

"
"
Use your owner's manual to locate the exhaust manifold.,
Familiarize yourself with your manifold's design.",How to Clean Exhaust Manifolds1,"


4-cylinder engines have one exhaust manifold.
6 or 8-cylinder vehicles have two manifolds.
Look for the manifold in front of the engine block on a front-end driven vehicle.
Find the manifold on the side of the engine block on a rear-driven.
This may vary slightly on boat engines or those on other small vehicles.;
,

Most exhaust manifolds are made of cast iron or a steel alloy similarly able to handle high temperatures.
Each manifold has an exhaust port matched to each exhaust outlet on the cylinder head.
The exhaust flows through these ports to a single outlet.
These ports are openings in an otherwise flat machined surface that fits with a gasket to the surface of the cylinder head.
Gaskets, made of paper, asbestos materials, or copper, serve as seals to prevent leakage between the manifold and cylinder head.

Check the fuel pump fuse.,
Check the voltage at the pump itself.,
Perform a drop test using a voltmeter.",How to Check Your Fuel Pump1," Often, it's not the pump itself that fails to function, but the power that supplies it. Check in your owner's manual for the location of the fuse box, then find the fuse that corresponds to the fuel pump. Pull it out and inspect it for signs of failure. If the fuse is blown, it will be broken or burned. If it looks good, check the rest of the fuses related to the fuel system for signs of being blown and replace them, if necessary. If no fuses are blown, have a helper turn the key while you listen for fuel pump relay clicking on.


If you need to replace a fuse, make sure you use one with a proper amp rating, never installing one with more amps than necessary.
If you find a blown fuse, that might be a sign that you've got a high amp draw and you need to check the individual circuits. Try to replace the blown fuel fuse and try and start vehicle. If the fuse blows again, a direct short is present and will need to be diagnosed. Take your car into the shop to get it checked out.;
, Just because you're getting juice from the circuit doesn't mean that it's getting to the pump itself, which makes it important to check the voltage there as well. Check out your vehicle's service manual to find out where to check and the proper procedure for checking it.



Test for source voltage, to determine whether or not the good charge that's leaving the fuse is getting to the pump. If no power is making it to the fuel pump, then check the fuel pump relay circuit. You could have a bad relay.

, Check to make sure that the power wire shows the full voltage and the grounding wire shows that it's grounded properly. If this electrical test reveals nothing, it's likely that your fuel pump is the problem and it will need to be replaced, though you can check more thoroughly by completing an additional pressure test.


If you show more than one volt difference, that means you've got a problem with corroded wires, or that you've got issues with the circuit on either the positive or negative side. Take it into the shop for further testing and advice.

Eliminate the filter as a possibility.,
Get a fuel pressure gauge.,
Hook the pressure gauge to the fuel pump test fitting.,
Have a helper rev the engine while you check the gauge.",How to Check Your Fuel Pump2," If the filter gets clogged with sediment, you can have trouble accelerating and might suspect your fuel pump has got a problem. To check it, remove filter from vehicle and drain excessive fuel from filter. Use a short piece of rubber hose on the filter inlet. Blow through the filter inlet, paying attention to the resistance, which should be minimal. Inspect the screen for debris and replace the filter if necessary by blowing through the outlet side of filter into a white rag or towel., Commonly available at most auto parts stores for $20-30, a pressure gauge is a good investment, useful on most makes and models of cars. If you don’t want to buy one, you can also often borrow one from machine shops or auto shops who have them to lend. The test only takes a few minutes.

, Locate your fuel pump test point, which is usually near the fuel injectors, and locate the point at which the pump hooks up with the filter injector rail. There should be a separation joint or a test port, where the pressure gauge attaches.


Different gauges may have slightly different instructions, and the location of the fuel pump varies from vehicle to vehicle, so consult your owner’s manual for more specific instructions., Let the engine warm up slightly, then check the pressure both at idle speed and at the rated speed listed in your pump specifications. If you don’t know the rated speed, just rev the engine and see how the pressure reacts. If you have a serious problem, the needle won’t go anywhere or goes down below specifications, meaning the fuel pump needs to be replaced.


The pressure should match the specifications listed in the repair manual, and should increase as you rev the engine. If it doesn’t, you need to replace your fuel pump and filter.

Understand how Honda oxygen sensors work.,
Check your oxygen sensors regularly.,
Find out how many Honda oxygen sensors your vehicle has.,
Test your Bosch oxygen sensors if you've been using leaded gasoline, have a problem with coolant leaks or frequently add oil to your car.,
Pay attention to any of the following signs of trouble coupled with a check engine light on the dashboard:

Emissions test failure.,
Borrow or purchase a good quality digital voltmeter.,Connect the positive lead of the voltmeter to the sensor output wire.,Attach the negative lead to the accessory bracket or clean engine block.,
Turn the key without starting the engine.,
Start the car and run the engine at at least 2,000 RPM for a few minutes to warm up the sensor.,
Look for rapid voltage changes from 0.2 to at least 0.7.,
Unplug the voltmeter if you don't see the correct voltage changes.",How to Check Honda Oxygen Sensors,"

A rich fuel mixing with little oxygen in the exhaust leads to a typical voltage of 0.8 to 0.9 through the sensor's platinum electrodes.
A lean fuel mixture with more oxygen in the exhausts causes the voltage to drop 0.1 to 0.3 volts.
A balanced air and fuel mixture averages around 0.45 volts.;
, Honda oxygen sensors usually last at least 50,000 miles (80,000 km), but older cars, or contaminated sensors, may affect their ability to reduce emissions. The sensors should be checked at these intervals:

Unheated oxygen sensors (1976 to early 1990 models): Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles (48,000 to 80,000 km).
The first generation of heated oxygen sensors (mid-1980s to mid-1990s): Every 60,000 miles (97,000 km).
The second generation of heated oxygen sensors (since the mid-1990s): Every 100,000 miles (160,000 km).

,

Some vehicles introduced two Bosch oxygen sensors on V6 and V8 engines in the late 1980s.
The number of Honda oxygen sensors doubled when Onboard Diagnostics II was developed in the mid-1990s.
Check for extra oxygen sensors near the catalytic converter.

,

A Honda oxygen sensor may fail if it becomes contaminated by silicone (from gasket sealers), phosphorus or lead.
Check oxygen sensors for other causes of failure, including mechanical stress or environmental factors such as road splash.

,
Drivability issues, such as hesitation.
Increased fuel consumption.

,

Analog voltmeters don't work well enough to check oxygen sensors.

,,,

Check the connections and repeat the process if you don't see a change in the voltage.

,

You may need to rev the engine a few times.
Look for several cross counts (passing the 0.45 volt mark) per second. This indicates closed looped operation and tells you the engine is warm enough.

, If this occurs, the Honda oxygen sensor is good.

If the voltage stays steady below 0.45, it is steady low.
If the voltage stays steady above 0.45, it is steady high. Allow air to enter the PCV valve. If this moves the voltage to less than 0.3, the sensor is probably good.

,

Reattach and repeat the steps.
You have a bad oxygen sensor if there are still no rapid voltage changes.

Locate the air filter and remove it.,
Find the adjustment screws on the front of the carburetor.,
Start the engine and let it warm to normal operating temperature.,
Adjust both screws equally and find the right mixture.,
Replace the air filter assembly.",How to Adjust a Carburetor1," On most cars, you'll need to remove the air filter to expose to carburetor and adjust it. Open the hood and make sure the engine is off before locating the air filter and removing the assembly. Unscrew the wing-nut and any other connectors, and then remove the air filter entirely.


Depending on your make and model, and the kind of engine in the vehicle, the air filter could be in any number of different places on the engine. Consult the owner's manual or the shop guide for your vehicle.
On most carbureted cars, the air cleaner housing is attached directly to the carburetor.;
, There should be two screws on the front of the carburetor, which are used to adjust the air and fuel mixture.


Often these look like flat-head screws and you can use a screwdriver to turn them, adjusting the amount of fuel and air mixing in the carb.
Some carburetors, such as the Quadrajet found in most GM vehicles, have a special screw and require a specific adjusting tool. The Quadrajet uses a Double ""D"" carburetor adjusting tool.
Other carburetors may have a 4 corner idle mix adjustment (4 idle mixture screws).

, Check the temperature gauge to know when it's at the appropriate running temp, and listen to the sound of the engine to get some sense of the adjustments that need to be made.



An engine that runs lean will ping at higher RPM, when the throttle is open, as if you were flooding a gear. More gas needs added to the mixture.

An engine that runs rich won't necessarily make a change in sound, but you'll be able to smell it. Bring the gas down some.An engine that runs too rich at idle will cause the plugs to be fuel-fouled, leading to a vehicle that is harder to start cold.

, Adjusting the carburetor is a lot like tuning a guitar or other stringed instrument. You want to turn the screws equally, smoothly, and slowly until you find the sweet spot. Regardless of whether or not the engine is running too rich or too lean, bring it down to a very lean mixture by turning both screws a quarter-turn at a time, counter-clockwise, then slowly bringing them back up to an equal and smooth mixture.


Adjusting the mixture is an imprecise art, requiring that you know your engine well and listen close. Bring both screws up slowly and listen until the engine purrs smoothly. Any raggedness or rattling is a sign of too lean a mixture. Keep turning until you find the sweet spot.

, When you've got the carb adjusted, put the air filter back on and you're ready to roll.


If you need to adjust the idle speed as well, wait to put the air filter back on until you're finished."
"
Find the idle adjustment screw.,
Start the engine and let it warm to running temperature.,
Turn the idle adjustment screw to tighten.,
Listen to the car's engine for sounds of roughness and readjust if necessary.,
Replace the air filter and finish the job.",How to Adjust a Carburetor2," There is an idle speed screw that adjust the opening of the throttle plate, and an idle mixture screw that limits the flow of fuel at idle. You want to adjust this second screw. As always, consult the owner's manual or shop guide for your make and model, if you can't find the screws.

, Just as you did with the fuel/air mixture, let the engine warm up some to make sure you're adjusting at actual running condition.

, Turn the screw clockwise, no more than a half-turn, and listen to the engine. Most owner's manuals will have an optimum speed to set the idle, though you have some wiggle room if you prefer it higher or lower. Consult you owner's manual for the number and consult the tachometer as you adjust.

, It should take about 30 seconds for the engine to adjust to the change you made, so don't get happy fingers and over-adjust. Make slow turns and listen closely to the response.

, When you've got the idle adjusted to the proper specifications, or to your own preferences, kill the engine and replace the air filter to finish the job.

Disconnect the hose from the brake system.,
Remove any brackets or bolts along the flexible line.,
Remove the hose from the brake caliper or wheel cylinder.,
Attach the new hose to the brake caliper or wheel cylinder.,
Attach the new hose to the brake system.,
Bleed the brakes.",How to Change Brake Lines1," The flexible hose will most likely be a rubber hose (sometimes it may be braided steel) leading from the central brake line to the caliper piston in disc brakes or the wheel cylinder in drum brakes. To disconnect the hose, you should remove the retainer clip between the hose and the steel line. Next, you can turn the connector with a wrench until it comes loose.








Do not crank too much on these connections. If you do you may bend the metal brake lines and then have to replace them as well. Instead, drain the line by cutting the brake hose and use a torch to heat the connection. This will break it loose and you can remove it.;
, The brake hose may be mounted to the strut or another sturdy point between the central line and the wheel. You will need to locate any such connections by tracing the line from end to end. Loosen and remove any mounting connections you find.







, Now that the hose is disconnected from the lines to the master cylinder, you need only remove it from the brake itself. To do this you need to loosen the bolt found at the end of the brake line (known as a banjo bolt). This is often done with a 14mm socket or wrench, but the size can vary depending on make and model. There is also a washer on either side of the brake line (between the line and banjo bolt and the line and brake) that needs removed.







, To attach the new brake hose, you will simply reverse the steps you took to remove the original. This means putting the washers in first, then tightening the banjo bolt at the end of the brake hose.







, First, attach the retainer clip. This holds the brake hose in place while you make the connection and is usually attached by sliding it into the appropriate holder at the end of the brake hose. Next, fasten the connector between the brake hose and lines leading the the master cylinder. This should be done with a wrench or flare nut wrench. You should also reconnect any brackets that hold the line secure (often found on the struts or other steering component).







, Bleeding the brakes is necessary to remove air that you have introduced into your brake line. Open up the bleeder cap found on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder and have someone pump the brake to force the air out of the bleeder cap. Wait until you see fluid coming out of the bleeder cap, and then close the cap.








There are also pressure bleeders and gravity bleeders available for bleeding brakes."

This will allow you to put a socket on the fitting and remove it from the distribution block more effectively than with a wrench. If the fittings are stuck on, use penetrating oil to loosen them.The distribution blocks can be identified by the multiple brake lines running into them. They mounted near the front and rear of the vehicle and serve to distribute brake fluid from the main line to each of the wheels.

, There should be approximately four connections to the master cylinder (depending on make and model).These will need to be loosened by using a wrench or flare nut wrench. Be careful not to twist the lines or strip the connections., The steel brake lines are run along the underside of the car and mounted with plastic clips to hold them in place. You will need to remove the line without damaging these clips. The replacement line will need to fit back into the same clips., Once all of the connections are loose, you can pull the brake lines out from under the car. This will make it easier to measure out and cut the appropriate amount of brake line from your roll. , Steel brake pipes can be bought in rolls. This means that you will have to measure the old brake line, straighten out the roll, and cut the appropriate length of line. Be sure to compare it to the old brake line before trying to hook it up. Remember that it’s not a straight shot from one end of the car to the other, and that you have to follow the same path as the old lines., Fittings to connect the line to your distribution blocks or master cylinder should be installed prior to taking the line under the car. There are different types of brake line fittings. Consult your service manual to know whether to use tapered pipe threading, inverted flare fittings, or compression fittings., The new brake line should be run from the master cylinder to the distribution blocks in the same way as the original brake line. That means you will need to follow the path of the original brake line and use the factory mounting clips to clip the new line to the vehicle. Again, the new line needs to be exactly the same length as the old line., You should use the same type of fitting as the one you removed. Oftentimes, the fittings can be salvaged and put onto the new brake line. This ensures that you will have the right fittings for your connections., Use a wrench or flare nut wrench to reconnect all appropriate fittings to the master cylinder. The same applies here as the distribution block connects ― if you can reuse the old connectors that’s fine. If you cannot reuse the old connectors, make sure you get the correct type of replacement., You will likely drain all or most of the brake fluid from you vehicle while replacing these lines. It is important to use manufacturer recommended brake fuel to replace what has been lost and then bleed the air from your lines."

Check your owner’s manual for the exact location if you’re unsure. Low brake fluid is a sign of a leak in the braking system., You will need to loosen your lug nuts while the car is still on the ground. Next jack up your car and secure it with jack stands. Once the car is in the air you can finish removing the lugs and tires. Be sure to slide the tires under your car. This provides an extra layer of protection if your jack stands fail., Look for any indication of damage to the brake line. Rust on the steel lines can be indicative of problems, also dried out or cracked rubber lines will need replaced. Look for a drip or wet place on the lines. You should also pay attention to the ground beneath the lines. If there is a drip, the fluid will be visible on the ground., Sometimes it is difficult to see the brake fluid underneath the car. If you suspect a leak or damaged brake lines, you should always feel the length of the line with your hands. This will ensure that you do not miss any leaks."

Finished.,Never use brake fluid not fit for a specific car

",How to Bleed Car Brakes," It is usually a light colored reservoir with a black cap and is usually is inline with your brake pedal in the engine compartment.;
, Using a clean turkey baster, suck out as much of the old, inky fluid as you can.

, After you've gotten all the old brake fluid out, clean any sediment out of the reservoir, if accessible, with a clean, lint-free rag. Do not spill any brake fluid on any painted surfaces, it will remove the paint almost immediately. Clean up any spilled fluid with a brake clean fluid or soap and water.

, Replace the top of the master cylinder reservoir.

,, Using a box-end wrench (often 5/16"") that fits the bleeder bolt, loosen the bleeder valves, but leave them closed. A little oil drizzled or sprayed on the bolts the day before will help to loosen them.

, Using a piece of clear plastic tubing (aquarium tubing works fine), push one end of the tube over the brake bleeder bolt.


Put the other end of the tube into a small, clear bottle with an inch or two of clean brake fluid in it. (This will keep air from being sucked back into the brake cylinder or lines.)

, This will prevent the pedal from traveling too close to the floor and you begin to bleed the brakes. This is needed so you do not bottom out pistons in the master cylinder and causing internal master cylinder leakage.

, Remove the top of the master cylinder reservoir and top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Keep the master cylinder full during process otherwise air might get into system.

,, The helper should shout ""down"" when the pedal is down as far as it will go.



Note: Not too much force is needed. Press down as much as you would to fully come to a halt before a stop sign.

, Old fluid and air will go down the tubing into the bottle. When the fluid stops, close the bleeder valve.



Note: Warn your helper that the brake pedal he or she is pressing down on will sink down as you unlock the bleeder bolt a quarter turn. This is perfectly natural and your helper should keep pressure and follow pedal down until it stops and hold it down.

,, After every five times the brake pedal is depressed, top off the master cylinder reservoir with fresh fluid. Never let the reservoir get too low, or air will be sucked into the master cylinder.

,,,,, Your brakes have been properly bled. Thank your helper by buying him or her a beer or cream soda. Never take your help for granted.

Socket set
Brake line wrench
Drop light
Screwdrivers
Needlenose pliers
Torque Wrench
Gloves and goggles
Brake fluid
Car jack
Service manual;
,, Ensure the jack is positioned correctly in a safe position under your car, then add jack stands and wheel blocks to keep the car secure. Never work under a car with just the hydraulic jack.It is not strong or stable enough.

Refer to your owner's manual for lifting points if you are unsure where to place the jack.



 



, Turn the wheel to the proper position to where the caliper may be accessed easily.

,, Remove the retaining bolts that hold the caliper's brake hose in place to allow movement with a wrench.


Some cars may have clips in place of the bolts. Use the edge of a Phillips or flathead screwdriver to pry open the clips. Throw away the old brass or copper washers. Never reuse old washers.

, Never clamp or crimp a brake line, as it can be damaged and this would result in brake failure, possibly causing an accident or worse., The fitting shown is also known as a ""banjo"" fitting.

, Some vehicles have 2 bolts, while others may only have one to take out.

, Carefully remove the brake pads from the caliper. Try to avoid dropping brake pads as it can cause serious damage.

, If there is any corrosion or interference be sure to remove before new caliper installation.

, Place the brake pads into the new caliper if they are not preloaded. Do not apply grease to the side of the brake pad that is in contact with the rotor.
, Install new mounting bolts (if supplied) if not reuse the bolts you removed and tighten to your vehicle's specifications. You might need a torque wrench to do this. Be sure not to over tourque.

, Torque to your vehicle specifications.

,, Refill with proper DOT specification for you vehicle, any brake fluid that was lost.

, Snug the lug nuts in a star formation. Carefully lower your vehicle back onto the ground. Refer to the owner's manual for the final torque value and tighten with a torque wrench only after the tires are back on the ground. The use of an impact wrench by an untrained person isn't recommended.

, if brakes don't feel like they are working properly, contact a certified technician immediately.

Please find a safe location, away from traffic, to park your car as you work.;
, To gain access to the brake lines you will need to remove all four of your car's wheels. To do this raise the car on four jack stands, remove the hubcaps, loosen the lug nuts and remove all four wheels.

, The brake fluid reservoir or master cylinder reservoir is located under the car hood. To find the brake fluid reservoir open the hood and locate a small container - usually light colored with a black cap - on the driver’s side of the car. This is the brake fluid reservoir

, To clean the brake fluid reservoir, first remove any old brake fluid from the reservoir. To do this, remove the reservoir's lid and use a turkey baster (or similar siphoning system) to remove all of the old brake fluid from the reservoir. When the reservoir is empty, use a clean cloth to remove any sediment from the interior of the reservoir.


Be very careful that you do not spill any brake fluid on your car's painted surfaces, as brake fluid will damage your paint.
Dirt particles can contaminate brake fluid and cause brakes to fail. This is why it is important to clean out the reservoir.
If you find upon opening the brake fluid reservoir that the brake fluid is low, you likely have a leak in your brake lines. The brake system is a closed system and you should not lose brake fluid over time . This problem should be addressed by professionals.

, Once the reservoir is clean, refill it with new brake fluid to the fill line. When filled, replace the lid of the brake fluid reservoir.

, Pump your brakes (press your brake pedal down) 15 or more times. This will work down the clean brake fluid.

, Locate the bleeder valves, near where the tires once were. Wipe off any debris from the bleeder valves and loosen their caps using a box-end wrench.


You may need to use penetrating oil (WD-40) to loosen the bleeder valve caps.

, Start with the brakes furthest from the brake cylinder, usually the back right brakes. Locate the brake line's bleed screw and slide one end of the clear tubing over the nipple on the bleed screw . Submerse the other end of the tubing into a few inches of clean brake fluid in a disposable container.


You want to submerse the tubing in clean brake fluid to prevent air from being sucked up into the braking system.

, Get a helper to slowly and evenly press the brake pedal to the floor and hold it down. The helper should signal ""down"", as they continue to hold the pedal down .

, While your helper is holding down the brake pedal, open the brake lines by turning the bleeder bolt a quarter turn. When you do this old brake fluid will travel down the tubing into the waste bottle. As this happens the brake pedal will settle further down under your helper's foot.


Failure to hold the brake down while the bleeder bolt is open, will suck air into the brake system . Do not do this. Make sure that the brake pedal is down when any bleeder bolts are open.

, When fluid stops flowing, close back up the bleeder valve. Only after the bolt is closed again should the helper release the brake pedal.

, After the bleeder bolt is closed again, signal to the helper to release the brake.

, Repeat the steps, ""Depress the brake"", ""Open the bleeder bolt"", ""Close the bleeder bolt"", ""Release the brake"" on the same brake line until the brake fluid runs clean. This may take 10-15 repeats. After the brake fluid runs clean, close the bleeder bolt for a final time.


After every five repeats make sure to top off the brake fluid reservoir. This is important, otherwise you risk sucking air into your brake system.

, Repeat the ""Bleed the Car Brakes"" section on the other three brake lines, left-rear, right-front and left-front, until the brake fluid runs clean.

, Make sure no brake fluid has spilled on the rotors or brake pads. If any has spilled, use brake cleaning spray to remove it.

, Replace all four wheels and hand-tighten the lug nuts. Engage the parking brake. Lower the vehicle to the ground and tighten the lug nuts. Replace the hub caps if present.

, Tap the brake pedal a few times without the motor running until all the slack in the line is removed. Go for a slow test drive to see if the brakes are functioning correctly before going for a long drive.

, Park your bike in a flat, safe place. Turn your bike's front wheel into the position needed to make the brake fluid reservoir, also known as the master cylinder, level. Lock your wheel into position.


Make sure you find a safe location to park your bike as you work, away from traffic.

, If your brake levers are adjustable, set them at their most open setting .

, Remove the rubber caps from the bleed screws. Remove the brake fluid reservoir's cover to expose the brake fluid.

, Using a turkey baster or similar siphoning system remove all of the old brake fluid from the reservoir. When empty, use a clean cloth to remove any sediment from the interior of the reservoir.


Be very careful that you do not spill any brake fluid on your bike's painted surfaces, as it can damage your paint.
Dirt particles can contaminate brake fluid and cause brakes to fail.
If you find that the brake fluid is low upon opening the brake fluid reservoir, you have a leak. The brake system is a closed system and you should not lose brake fluid over time . If you have low brake fluid, the leak needs to be addressed by a professional to insure safe riding.

, Once the reservoir is clean, refill it with new brake fluid to the fill line.

, Attach the first vacuum hose from a bleed screw to the pump bottle using an adapter as needed. Attach the second vacuum hose from the bottle to the vacuum pump.

, Squeeze the pump handle until the pressure registers between 10 and 20 mmHg . While under pressure, loosen the bleed screw a quarter turn. Fluid should be seen filling the bottle.


Tighten/loosen the screw for an even, controlled flow. If the bleed screw is too loose the fluid will flow too rapidly and air will get into the system.

, As the brake fluid drains, you will notice the brake fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir falling . Continue to pour new brake fluid into the brake fluid reservoir to maintain the fluid level. If you do not maintain the brake fluid in the reservoir air will enter the braking system.

, When there are no air bubbles visible in the hose and the brake fluid runs clean, you are done. Tighten the bleed screw, before turning off the vacuum .

, Repeat the steps ""Attach the vacuum hoses"", ""Vacuum out brake fluid"", ""Keep reservoir full"", ""Stop"" on the alternate side caliper.

, Repeat steps ""Vacuum Pump Method"" section on other tire's brake lines.

, Slide one end of the clear tubing over the nipple on a bleed screw . Submerse the other end of the tubing into a few inches of clean brake fluid in a disposable container (an old water bottle works).


You want to submerse the tubing in clean brake fluid to prevent air from being sucked up into the braking system.

, Pump the brake lever about five times.

, Hold the brake lever down with one hand, and open the bleed screw with a box wrench with your other hand. This will allow old brake fluid to flow into the catch bottle .

, Only after closing the screw are you safe to release the brake. If you release the brake while the screw is open you will suck air into your braking system.

, Repeat the steps ""Pump the brakes"", ""Hold the brake and drain"", ""Close the bleed screw, then release brake"" at least five times.


While repeating this process make sure to regularly check the fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir. If you do not keep the reservoir full, air will enter the braking system through the empty reservoir. Add brake fluid as needed to keep it full.
Repeat this process at least 5 times. Repeat until the brakes feel solid, if you just want to bleed the brakes; or until the brake fluid run cleans, if you want to replace the fluid.

,,, When satisfied, make sure the expansion gasket on the reservoir is clean and close the topped-off reservoir. Press the gasket into place. Remove the catch bottle and tubing, and replace the rubber caps over the bleed screws .

, Make sure no brake fluid has spilled. If any has spilled, use brake cleaning spray to remove it.

, Squeeze the brakes a few times without the motor running until all the slack in the line is removed. Then go for a slow test ride to see if the brakes are functioning correctly before going for a long ride."

When the brake fluid becomes clear, direct your partner to hold the pedal to the floor.,
In order to make sure your brakes are not spongy and there aren't any leaks in the system, perform this test when your are finished bleeding the brakes.,
Get rid of any surplus brake fluid in a proper and safe manner.,
Replace all four wheels and hand-tighten all the lug nuts.,
Go for a test drive to verify that the brakes are functioning correctly.",How to Bleed Brake Lines," The sinking brake pedal often does mean the brake lines need to be bled. However, it is very important to confirm that the sinking pedal is not caused by something else.


Try this simple test when you are stopped and waiting at a red light. With your foot, keep an even pressure on the brake pedal. Does the pedal sink lower, even a little bit? If so, then you should have your car's brake system inspected by an ASE Certified Master Auto Technician to confirm the root cause is not something else. If the pedal holds constant pressure, then there is no air in the system.
A sinking brake pedal could also be caused by other things that could be very dangerous. For example, brake pedals can also sink if there is a hydraulic problem, like a failing master cylinder, a leaking rear wheel cylinder, a bad caliper or bad ABS. So it is important to rule out these dangerous possibilities via professional inspection before proceeding.;
, Cars with automatic transmissions should be in park and those with standard transmissions should be in first gear. The emergency (or parking) brake should be on at all times.

, Remove all four wheels.

, It's a fist size (or larger) transparent container that is bolted to the firewall on the driver’s side of the car. It will be connected to an aluminum object the has metal tubes coming out of its sides. These metal lines are the brake lines that direct the hydraulic brake fluid to your individual wheels. There the brake fluid activates either the disc or drum brake components that stop your car.

, Fill the Master Cylinder with fresh, clean brake fluid, making sure that it's the proper type for your car. If you have questions, ask the parts person to look up your car's brake fluid when you purchase it.

, Using a box-end wrench, loosen the bleeder screw. Take a piece of rubber vacuum hose and put it on to the end of the bleeder screw and put the other end into an empty clear plastic bottle.

, Have your partner pump the brakes slowly until the dirty fluid comes out of the brakes lines and into the bottle. Allow enough fluid to exit so that the end of rubber hose is submerged in brake fluid. (Check the Master Cylinder frequently to make sure there is plenty of brake fluid.)

, Close the bleeder screw with the wrench and have your partner pump the pedal 3 times and hold it. Open up the bleeder screw briefly to allow the brake fluid to exit the rubber hose. Have your partner tell you when the brake pedal is on the floor, and, have him/her keep it there while you close the bleeder screw. Repeat this process two more times. (Remember periodically check the Master Cylinder fluid level, so it does not go dry!) After the third time, tighten the bleeder screw and repeat this process on the other three wheels and, in this order; Left Rear, Right Front and Left Front.


Depending on the vehicle, the bleeding procedure will vary in which wheel is bled first, second and so on. The above sequence will work for a large portion of vehicles, however you should check with a website like Alldata or similar to verify bleeding sequence.

, With the engine off, have your partner push down on the brake pedal and go around to all four wheels and check for leaks. Then, push the brake pedal with your foot. It should travel about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) and stop. The brake pedal should feel very hard at this stopping point.

, Remember that brake fluid is considered hazardous waste and therefore should never be poured down the sink or toilet, onto the ground in your yard, in the garbage, or down the sewer drain or septic tank.Talk with your local auto shop or look for a household hazardous waste (HHW) recycling collection site., Lower the vehicle to the ground and properly torque the lug nuts. Replace the hub caps if necessary.

, If there are still problems, have your car inspected by an ASE Certified Master Auto Tech.

They're listed in the Things You'll Need section of this page. Most should be available with a basic garage tool set. If you don't have a specific one, most auto parts stores will allow you to rent one out by paying a deposit which is returned after the tool is.

.
, Now that you have all the tools to do the job you'll need to make sure it's done safely. Safety glasses, closed or steel toe shoes, working gloves and preferably pants are all recommended., Place chocks or a solid piece of wood behind either of the rear wheels to prevent the car from moving.

, Loosen the front lug nuts using a breaker bar and a 19mm socket. Do not remove the lug nuts completely! A quarter of a turn in the counter clockwise direction should be enough.

If you have a wheel lock nut, always remove it first and install last!

, This will unlock the wheel and keep your battery off.

Make sure to roll down a window or keep a door open so you don't lock your keys in the car.

, Place a small wooden board between the jack and the frame to prevent any damage. You don't have to worry about this if the lifting surface of your jack is rubber., Watch for any movement or slippage of the jack. If positioned properly it will lift the vehicle straight and directly upwards. If you see any tilt or slippage, stop immediately. Assess the situation and lower the car very slowly. Re-position the jack properly and repeat the lifting procedure., This should be enough the position the jack stands underneath the support location. It is identified by two cutouts in the pinch-weld of the car., Then lower the jack onto them until they touch. It is always a good idea to leave the jack just touching the lifting spot, it provides additional safety and saves time later on when lowering the car., Do this by giving the car a slight push down on the hood and sideways on the fender.

, Turn the steering wheel in the direction such that it gives you better access to caliper bolts. (Working on the drivers side, turn the wheel to the left)., Using a ratcheting wrench and a 15mm socket. On this model they are integrated with caliper pins so put them on a rag to be cleaned and re-greased later. Notice that the pins are different. One of them has a rubber insert on it and that one always goes in the top caliper hole., Do this by tugging on it or placing a small pry bar between it and the rotor to pry it off. Use a rubber strap or a piece of wire to secure the rotor to the suspension spring. This will prevent any potential damage to the brake hose.



If the caliper pin bolts do not move and appear to be seized, stop immediately! Put the wheels back on and have an automotive shop perform the brake job. Removing seized caliper pins requires additional tools.

, Using a 15mm socket. These may be very tight and it might be easier to loosen with a breaker bar. Remove the bolts and remove the caliper bracket. Use a small hammer to make the pads come out of the bracket. Although sometimes they can be removed by hand.

, Do this by pulling and wiggling it side to side. If it is stuck use penetrating oil in the holes where the lug studs come out, let it rest for a few minutes. Proceed to tap the back of the rotor with a hammer while alternating sides to gradually remove it from the hub.

, It does not have to be perfect, as long as major rust is removed.


If your pads came with hardware (metal shims) you can remove the old ones from the caliper bracket and use a wire brush to clean the rust off from underneath the old shims.
If you do not have new shims, do not remove the old ones. Just use the wire brush to clean the rust off from the top of the old shims.

,, You will notice it is oily. This is done by the manufacturer to prevent corrosion while storing and transporting parts. This oil film needs to be removed by spraying all rotor surfaces with brake parts cleaner. Be very careful using this spray since it is a strong irritant to the eyes and skin. Always use protective eye-ware and gloves.


Brake parts cleaner usually dries and evaporates pretty quickly but if it does not just wipe it off with a clean rag. It is always a good idea to compare the new rotor to the old one and verify they are the same size.

, Take one of the lug nuts and thread it on any stud by hand as far as it will go. This will make the rotor stay in place and ease the rest of the installation.

, Your caliper bracket should be free of rust on the shim surface at this point. If you removed the old shims, install the new ones now. A good set of brake pads usually comes with a small packet of high temperature brake grease. Apply a very small amount of grease onto the shim surfaces as shown in the picture.


Manufacturer calls to put thread locking compound onto the caliper bolts.

, Torque the bolts to 133 lb.ft (180 N.m).

, If you look closely you may notice the brake pads are not the same. Two of them should be with small tabs on them and two without. The pad with a small tab goes on the inside surface of the rotor.

, This might be a little tricky. Install the far part of the pad first and gently push in the middle of the pad. It should slide right in. Do the same on the outer side of the caliper bracket.

, In order to do this you need to compress the piston first. It is recommended that you open the bleeder and let the fluid drain out into the drain pan below. Use a 10mm wrench to brake loose the bleeder. Do not use excessive force. If the bleeder does not come loose, stop immediately! Breaking the bleeder will render the caliper unusable and you will have to purchase a new one. If the bleeder does not come lose, open the hood of the car and remove the cap from the brake fluid reservoir, this will release pressure as the caliper piston is being compressed., Position the large C-clamp on the caliper as shown in the picture below. Begin to turn the handle of the C-clamp to compress the piston until it is flush with the surface of the caliper. If the piston is very hard to move, your caliper might be seized and will have to be replaced.

, Discard the old brake pad., Failure to perform this step correctly will cause your brake pedal to be very soft and may become a safety issue.


Ensure that the pin boots are not folded over and are positioned in the way that the pins will fit in them.

, Remember that the pin with a rubber insert goes in the top hole and through the rubber pin boot. Tighten the bolts and torque them to 70 lb.ft (95 N.m).

Remove the lug nut supporting the rotor on the hub.

, Afterwards replace the cap of the brake fluid reservoir., Put the wheels back on the studs and hand tighten the lug nuts. Remember to keep the wheel flush on the surface of the rotor. Tighten the lug nuts as much as you can by holding the wheel with your free hand., Stop lowering immediately after the wheels make contact with the ground. There should be minimal weight on the wheels. Just enough to prevent them from moving., If you have a locking nut make sure to install it last and never toque it; just hand tighten. A good way to retain the star pattern and make the locking nut last to be tightened is to start torquing the lug nut directly opposite of the locking nut.

, It is a good idea to check or remove all the tools and old parts from underneath the car before lowering it., Repeat this 3-4 times or until the pedal gets stiff.,, Make sure everything is working properly and that there is no abnormal noise. Brand new brake pads might cause a slight hissing noise upon braking. You may also notice a strange smell after driving. This is all normal and should only last one or two days. Follow brake pad manufacturer recommendation on break in procedure."

It is also much less expensive than taking your master cylinder into a mechanic, who will quickly (and expensively) do it with vacuum pumps. It is also necessary if you are installing a new master cylinder. To bleed your master cylinder from the bench, gather the following supplies:


Your master cylinder with bleed kid
Fresh brake fluid
A workbench or table with a fixed vise. If you have neither of these, it will be more cost-effective to go to the next method, which does not require a specialized workspace.
A wooden or plastic dowel. Make sure this is strong, because you don't want it to snap while you're working.;
, Set aside the bleed kit that comes with the cylinder, as you will need it later.


If the new part didn't come with a reservoir, be sure to remove the one from the old part.

, Steadiness is key when bleeding your master cylinder in this way. Before doing anything else, mount your master cylinder in the vise on your workbench or table, and make sure it is level.


Hold the master cylinder by its flared mount, and make sure it is level. This way, the air will leave properly, and it will fill with brake fluid evenly without gaps.
It needs to be firmly secured, but not so tight you crush or damage cast aluminum parts. Make sure the plastic fittings are not crushed or blocked when putting the cylinder in the vise.
If your table does not have a pre-installed vise clamp, you can buy a separate vise that clamps on to the table if you do not have one pre-installed.
If you like the appearance of this table, it might be best not to use it, as vise clamps leave a mark on wood or metal. If you have no other usable tables, wedge a rag in between the vise clamps to avoid leaving a mark. This may not work, so proceed at your own risk.

, This should come with your master cylinder, and consists of two rubber hoses and two plastic threaded inserts.


The inserts will be threaded on one side, and the other will be a smooth adapter for taking the hose.
Check the color of your hose, too. If you have opaque hose, you might want to replace it with clear hose, because then you can see the air bubbles passing through the fluid more easily.
You can also opt not to use the bleeding kit, as it isn't necessary. However, this guide will assume that you are using the bleeding kit.

, These are located on the side of the cylinder past the flared mount.


Install these into the bosses (the threaded holes) without cross threading them. Make sure they are finger tight.

, Once you have attached the inserts into the cylinder, you can attach the rubber hoses to these inserts.

, This container will be used for catching the excess brake fluid, so make sure you don't mind that it gets dirty.


Consider attaching the hoses to the container in some way. Once you begin pumping, they will begin flailing about and spray blake fluid everywhere if they are not anchored down in some way.
An old coffee can works especially well for this, as does any cylindrical container with a wide, flared opening.

, If your reservoir runs out of brake fluid at any time during your bleed, you'll have to start from the beginning.


You should only put clean brake fluid that is less than two years old into the reservoir.
Make sure it's in between the ""max"" and ""min"" marks and covers the ends of the hoses. Brake fluid is very hygroscopic, which means it absorbs moisture and will degrade, and this damages the seals. Do not reuse brake fluid

, Make sure you do this slowly to avoid allowing air into the apparatus, or allowing the wooden dowel to snap.


Don't bottom out the piston, otherwise this might allow the entrance of air.
You have to pinch the rubber hoses closed each and every time you release pressure on the cylinder.

, This will compress the brake fluid, so it will shoot out when you release the hoses.


This also prevents air from entering the master cylinder by not providing a vacuum for it to fill.

,,


You will know you're finished pumping when there are no more air bubbles rising in the reservoir or present in the container of spent brake fluid.

,,


When installing it in the vehicle, keep it level and remove the bleeding kit as you install the lines. If you did this right, you shouldn't need to bleed the entire system, but you may want to to flush the system of old fluid.

, These should have come with the cylinder, and will prevent leakage.

, Otherwise brake fluid will leak out from the reservoir.

, You need to make sure that your brakes actually work before you begin driving your car.


If you've done it right, the brakes should feel clean and crisp when you pump them.
If you've done it wrong, the brakes will feel ""squishy"" when you pump them from your car, indicating there is still air in the master cylinder

"
"
Gather your supplies.,
Jack up the car.,
Place a container or jar underneath the master cylinder's bleeder nozzle or the place for the hose attachment.,
Ask your helper to slowly pump your brake pedal several times.,
Have your helper press and hold down the brake pedal.,
Detach the hoses connecting the brakes and the master cylinder.,
Examine the brake fluid.,
Reattach the hoses to the master cylinder.,
Have your helper release the pedal.

,
Repeat until the air is out of the master cylinder.",How to Bleed a Master Cylinder2," Unlike with bleeding a separate or new master cylinder, you can do this without gathering new parts or equipment. You will need:


A brake bleed screwdriver or wrench. You will have to loosen the screws that hold the hoses in place in order to bleed the master cylinder.
Pliers. You will need these to pinch the hose attached to your master cylinder in between pumps
WD-40 or other water-displacing solvent. Your brake bleed screw may be caked with oil or other contaminants and be difficult to unscrew. You'll use the WD-40 to remove this material and allow yourself to loosen the screw.
Jacks. Since the master cylinder is underneath your car, you'll want to jack up the car so you can get underneath it. Just make sure that the jacks are sound, so the car doesn't come crashing down on top of you.
A helper. He or she will pump your brakes while you fiddle with the hoses and screws underneath your car.

, This will allow you to get underneath it to work with the master cylinder.


Immobilize the car by blocking the wheels, and make sure it won't roll by parking it on a flat surface.
Don't detach the wheels, because if the jacks fail the wheels will give the car some bounce and perhaps prevent your untimely demise.

, This container will be used for catching the excess brake fluid, so make sure you don't mind that it gets dirty.


Consider attaching the hoses to the container in some way. Once you begin pumping, they will begin flailing about and spray blake fluid everywhere if they are not anchored down in some way.
An old coffee can works especially well for this, as does any cylindrical container with a wide, flared opening.

, Have him or her indicate to you what he or she is doing by calling out ""down"" when pressing the brake pedal and ""up"" when letting it go.

, Now you will begin doing some work on the master cylinder.

, This isolates your master cylinder and keeps you from bleeding your brakes as well.


You're trying to bleed your master cylinder, and not your brakes, so you don't want to affect the latter by messing with the former.
Likely, brake fluid will instantly fly out. This is why you want to have a container attached.
Before your helper releases the pedal, make sure you have the hoses back on.

, If there is air in the fluid, you will see air bubbles in what was discharged.


This is also why it is important to have a container or jar, because without collecting the fluid, you will have no idea whether there is fluid in the brakes or not.

, Failing to do so will allow air back in to the cylinder.

,,


Don't forget to continue topping up the master cylinder with brake fluid. Otherwise, you may introduce air into it and have to begin again.

Make sure to roll your window all the way down to be able to expose the window run.,
Once the window is down and you have access to the window run.,
Let it stand for about 30 to 60 seconds.

,
Start rolling the window up and down two to three times to allow the window to run smoothly on the run, causing the lower run to be lubricated also.

Start the vehicle.,
Release and set the parking brake repeatedly.,
Tap the parking brake lightly.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake1," Turn the key and start your vehicle. This will start warming up all of the car's components via heat from the engine and exhaust. It usually takes around ten minutes for the engine to warm up, but that does depend on the outside temperature.Revving the engine will speed up the process.;
, This is the easiest way to dislodge ice from your parking brake.It also has the added benefit of not requiring that you get out in the cold. If you have given your car time to heat up as suggested above, and tried five or ten times to release the brake without success, you should consider trying to tap the ice off of the brake.

, Consult your service manual to see which wheels the parking brake holds. Try gently tapping the brake drum or caliper with a hammer or mallet to dislodge any ice. You can put cardboard or a block of wood between the hammer and your bake components, though this is not necessary. You can also try gently wiggling the brake cable in an attempt to dislodge ice."

Just let them know the year, make and model of your car and select a pad in your price range. In general, the more expensive they are, the longer they last.


Some very expensive pads with a higher-than-desirable metal content may be aimed at the 'Rally' market for use with performance Rotors. You'll probably want to avoid these because they are likely to cause premature wear of standard Rotors. Also, some people find that less expensive pads are noisier than ""brand name"" pads.;
, If you have recently driven, you may be working with extremely hot pads, calipers and rotors. Be sure that these parts are safe to touch before moving on.








, Using the lug wrench provided along with the car's jack, loosen each of the lug nuts that hold the wheels onto the car about two thirds of the way.









Don't loosen all the tires at once. Generally, you'll change at least the two front pads or the two back pads, depending on your car and how evenly the brakes wear. So either start with the front or the back.

, Consult your owner's manual to determine the correct position for the car jack under your car. Put some blocks behind the other wheels to stop the car from rolling forward or back.









Place a jack stand under the frame of the vehicle. Do NOT trust the jack alone. Repeat for the other side of the car so that both sides are securely supported.

, Finish loosening and removing the lug nuts when the car is raised. Pull the wheel straight out towards you to remove it.









If the wheel rims are alloy and on the studs, you should clean the studs, stud holes, rotor mounting surface, and the rear mounting surface of the alloy wheel with a wire brush and apply anti seize compound before refitting the wheel.

, The brake pads will create friction with the rotors to slow the vehicle to a stop. Calipers generally come in one-piece or two-piece designs, secured with between two and four bolts at the inside of the stub axle housing, where the tire fits onto the axle.Spray these bolts with WD-40 or PB Penetrating Catalyst to aid in removing them.









Check the caliper pressure. The caliper of a car at rest should move back and forth a little bit. If not, the caliper is under pressure and it may fly off when you remove the bolts. Take extra precaution when checking to keep your body to the side of its path, even if it is loose.
Check to see if there are any shims or performance washers fitted between the caliper mounting bolts and the mounting surface. If there are, remove them and keep track of them to replace later. You will need to refit the caliper without the brake pads and measure the distance from the mounting surface to the brake pad to replace them appropriately.
Many Japanese vehicles use a two-piece sliding caliper that only requires the removal of two forward-facing slider bolts, with 12-14mm heads. You will not need to remove the entire caliper.

, The caliper will still be connected to the brake line, so hang it up with a small piece of wire hanger or other scrap metal, so that it won't hang and put pressure on the flexible brake hose.








, Finally! Note how each brake pad is attached. They typically snap or clip in with attached metal clips. Remove both pads. They may take a little force to pop out, so take care not to damage the caliper or brake line while getting them out.









Inspect brake rotors for warped, heat damage or cracks to surface and replace as needed. Rotors are recommended to be replaced or resurfaced during brake pad replacements.

, At this point, you can spread anti-seize lubricant on the metal contact edges and on the back of the pads. This will prevent a lot of squeaking. However, do not get any lubricant onto the inside of the brake pads. If any lubricant touches that material, the brake will not provide friction, and will be useless. Attach the new pads exactly the way the old ones were attached.








, Check your vehicle's brake fluid level and add some if necessary. Replace the brake fluid reservoir cap when finished.








, Slide the caliper slowly back over the rotor, proceeding easily so as not to damage anything. Replace and tighten the bolts that hold the caliper in place.








, Slide the wheel back into place and hand tighten each of the lug nuts snug before lowering the car.








, When the car is back on the ground, tighten the lug nuts in a ""star"" pattern. Tighten one lug nut, then one across from it until each nut is fully tightened to torque specification.









Check the owner's manual to find the torque specifications for your vehicle. This will ensure the lugs have been tightened enough to prevent the wheel coming off or over-tightening.

, Making sure the vehicle is in neutral or park, pump the brakes 15 to 20 times to make sure the pad is seated properly. Top off brake fluid levels or follow bleeding of brakes section to flush out old fluid and replace with new fluid.








, Going no more than 5 mph (8.0 km/h) on a quiet residential street, brake like normal. If the vehicle seems to stopping normally, repeat the test and go up to 10 mph (16 km/h). Repeat several more times, gradually going up to 35 or 40 mph (56 or 64 km/h). Also check in reverse. These braking tests ensure there are no issues with your brake-pad installation, gives you confidence when driving on main streets and helps ""seat"" the brake pads into place.









Listen for problems. The new pads may squeak a bit, but i you should hear a grinding, metal-on-metal sound, you probably have the brake pads reversed (i.e., the inside surface is incorrectly facing out). This should be corrected immediately.

, It will also absorb moisture from the air, dangerously lowering its boiling point. You'll need to bleed the brake fluid from the system before changing your pads and calipers, but you'll also (counterintuitively, perhaps) want to make sure the fluid is topped off before you do this. Check the fill line and add a little if you need to. Leave the cap off while you bleed the system.









The reason you need to add fluid is that you're bleeding the fluid from the calipers themselves--the fluid trapped in the line--and you still need a steady supply in the master cylinder.

, Generally, you want to bleed the brake most distant from the master cylinder first, so you'll need to check the owner's manual before you do this. All cars differ in the particular order. If you don't have the owner's manual, check with an auto parts store.








, Cheap aquarium tubes work well for this. Place the other end of the hose in a small bottle or pan to catch the fluid. To keep air from flowing back into the system, you should hang or hold the bottle above the calipers and keep gravity on your side.







, With the engine off, have your friend continually pump the brakes until they experience resistance. They should shout to you to let you know they're feeling resistance, at which point you should unscrew the bleeder screw slightly and tell them to hold the brake down.









The fluid should drain down the hose into the bottle or pan at this point. Screw the bleeder screw back in when your friend's foot touches the floor.
Repeat this process until you see no air bubbles in the tube., If compressing the brake pedal results in the fluid gurgling in the master cylinder, there are still air bubbles in the system. Start bleeding them again before you continue.

Locate an appropriate heat source.,
Apply heat to the brake components.,
Try to release your brake.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake2," A heat gun or hair dryer will usually work, but you may have to run an extension cord out to your vehicle. Another option is to use hot water, but be conscious of the current temperature. If it is still below freezing, you should not use water as it may refreeze., Look at your service manual to see which wheels the parking brake holds. Then use your heat source to apply heat to the brake cable and the calipers/drums at that wheel. You should apply the heat long enough for the brake components to be warm to the touch. The amount of time this takes will vary based on how cold it is outside.

This will have to be done from underneath the vehicle so you may need to lift your car.
For safety reasons, you should turn off your engine and chock your wheels before getting under the car.

, After applying heat to the brake system, immediately try to release the brake. Do not give the braking components time to refreeze."
"
Roll all of your windows down.,
Create a “tunnel” underneath the car.,
Allow the vehicle to warm up.,
Attempt to release the brake again.,
Take down your “tunnel."",
Allow the cab to ventilate before driving.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake3," You will be blocking off the spaces under the car, and running the risk of putting excess carbon monoxide into your car. You should roll your windows down and turn your fan on high to allow circulation., Shovel Snow or arrange other materials along the sides of the vehicle to block as much of the open space between the ground and sides of the vehicle as possible. The objective is to give the heat created by the engine a path to the rear of the vehicle where most of the parking brake components are located., Wait outside the vehicle while it is running. You want to allow the engine time to warm up and produce the heat necessary to melt any ice underneath the car.

, If still frozen, allow more time for thawing and/or block open spaces at the front and rear of the vehicle, too (this is particularly helpful if it is gusty or windy). Pushing down the accelerator slightly will increase heat by working the engine harder.


Leave your door open while pressing the accelerator and then get back out of the car. If you have any exhaust issues at all, or have the exhaust blocked off, you run the risk of filling the car with carbon monoxide. This can be deadly.

, Once the ice has thawed, you can remove the walls that you created to block the underside the car., Leave your windows down and your fan on high and allow the cab to displace any possible carbon monoxide buildup before sitting in the cab or driving. Again, carbon monoxide is deadly."

Purchase a replacement cable from a local parts dealer.,
Pull the car onto level, solid ground.,
Remove hubcaps from the wheels you will be working on.,
Loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench (tire iron) or impact wrench.,
Jack up the car.,
Remove the wheels.,
Remove the grease dust cap.,
Pull out the cotter pin.,
Remove the retaining nut.,
Inspect the drum.,
Attempt remove the drum.,
Retract the brake shoes.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake4," Park brake cables sometimes become corroded or get dirt and grim in them. If this happens, it can cause your brake to get stuck and not function properly. Your best option is to replace the cable., It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands., Consult your service manual to see which wheels are held by the park brake. If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them., It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs., Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the car up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the car are:

Your owner’s manual will recommend jacking points
The most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack.
You should use jack stands to stabilize the car.
If you have access to a hydraulic lift, it will save you time.

, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail., This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck, lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant., Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case, you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should:

Check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed.
Check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes.

The adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction.
Once the shoes are retracted, you can remove the drum and continue.

"
"
Remove the return springs.,
Remove the retaining rings that hold the brake shoes in place.,
Pull the brake shoe off.,
Remove the emergency brake line.,
Slide the emergency brake line out of the backing plate.,
Follow the length of the cable back to the brake lever.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake5," These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them, use the round part of the brake tool with a little notch. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe., One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., There will be a hole in the backing plate where the emergency brake line comes in from under the car. Use a flat screwdriver to depress the tabs on the brake cable that hold it in the backing plate and then pull it through the hole., Whether your brake is operated by a hand lever or a foot pedal, it will connect to the brake cable. Once you find this connection, use a flathead screwdriver to release the cable from its clip. Now that the cable is loose on both ends, you are ready to install your new cable."

Grease the new cable.,
Connect the new cable to the park brake lever.,
Run the cable to the backing plate.,
Connect the new brake line to your brake shoes.,
Grease the backing plate.,
Slide the bottom spring onto the brake shoe.,
Slide the shoe into place against the backing plate.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake6," It is important to lubricate the cable before installation to ensure that it works properly., Connect the front end of your new cable to the lever assembly by sliding it into the same clip that held the old cable., Be sure to fasten the cable to the body of the vehicle whenever called for in your service manual. You want to keep the correct amount of tension on the cable at all times to ensure that it functions properly. Slide the cable into the hole in your backing plate., Fasten the emergency brake cable to the brake shoe on the same side you removed it. To do this, pull up the cover and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed from it)., You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate., There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot., Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring."

Tighten the lugs to the specified torque.,
Add brake fluid if needed.,
Test the brake.",How to Free a Frozen Parking Brake7," Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring, press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place., Now, it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring., You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever., Use the flat end of your brake spring tool to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes., Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place., This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster., Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw)., You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now., You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening., The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly., You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands., Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly., Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual., You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work., Before you drive or park your car, you want to be sure that your park brake is working properly. Set the park brake and put the car into drive. The brake should hold the car still, or at the very least provide resistance. Release the brake and make sure that the resistance is gone."

;
, Damaged windshields are illegal to drive with and can impair your vision. If you have any cracks, replace your windshield as soon as possible to prevent tickets or more serious damage.









Before embarking on this project, check with your insurance company to see if a windshield replacement is covered. If so, you may be able to take your car to a body shop and have it replaced without a hefty bill.

, Using a heavy blanket or tarp, cover the front seats and dashboard to protect them from glass, debris, or any dripping urethane — a chemical used to seal the windshield in place. You and an assistant should always wear gloves and protective glasses while working








, Set these aside to be re-attached later.








, These may be on the inside or outside of the car. Since you will need new ones for your new window, you can throw these out. 







, You may need to use a small knife or crowbar to get it off at first; some trim will require special trim removal tools to prevent trim damage. Remove the urethane weather stripping as well so that only the windshield remains.









You may also use a knife to cut the seal along the perimeter before you try to pull it off. , This will make it easier to slide the windshield out later. Apply lubricant around the edge between the windshield and the car frame.









Wait several minutes for the lubricant to seep into the cracks before you move on. Make sure the seal all the way around the windshield has been cut with a windshield removal cut tool.

, Attach large suction cups, which you can buy online, tightly to the glass. Pull up with even pressure while a friend pushes the windshield from the inside.









It may be easier to have the person inside push the window out first, loosening the window, and then you pull with the suction cups.
Have the person inside the car recline the seat back so he can get their feet onto the glass and use his legs to push.
Do not stand on the hood or roof of the car — this will damage the body.
The windshield may come out suddenly, so make sure you are steady and balanced and don't fall backwards.

, Windshields should be disposed of in a landfill, not in your backyard. Check if your state offers windshield recycling programs, or if your local auto mechanic will dispose of it for you. 








Tape the windshield up in a thick blanket while you transport it to prevent cuts on any broken edges. , Make sure you get one that fits the make, model, and year of your car.









Use a water and a brush to clean the new windshield of dust before you start working.

, If there is still sealant or weather stripping attached to your car, remove it carefully with a knife and gloves and dispose of it.








, Using a paintbrush, add a thin amount of primer along the entire the inside edge of the window. You only need a strip about an inch wide. Then apply some primer to the windshield socket as well.









Allow the primer to dry. Do not touch the primer or the oil in your fingers can prevent the sealer from sticking to window or frame.

, While they come in many different forms, they all attach by sliding onto the tabs on the top of the windshield socket and hammering snugly into place.








, Apply the urethane evenly throughout the entire frame, working quickly to prevent it from drying.









Using a V-shaped nozzle will help the urethane sits higher, forming a better seal with the windshield. , Have the new windshield nearby — suction cups already attached — so that you can rapidly put it on the car before the urethane dries out. Push it gently but firmly into the window once you have it in place.








, This is also a good time to push any bubbling urethane back in between the car and the windshield. You want to create a perfect seal to keep the windshield in place and hold out rain. 







, Pop in your cars molding (you may need to buy more) and push it securely into the frame, closing off any exposed areas between the windshield and the car. Reinstall your cowl panel and windshield wiper arms.








, You want the windshield to be firmly in place before you move the car so that it doesn't pop out during an accident or acceleration. Refer to the directions on the sealant to see how long you need to wait.

Inspect all windows on your car including the back window and windshield.,
Purchase a specific type of windshield repair kit called a bridge kit.,
Clean the crack and its surrounding area so that it is free of dirt, loose glass, and other debris.,
Use the metal probe to create bull's-eye cracks at each end of the hairline crack.,
Load the specified amount of resin into the injector as instructed on the bridge-kit packaging.

,
Position the bridge apparatus so the injector is directly above the crack.,
Allow the resin to completely harden and dry.,
Apply a generous amount of resurfacing resin directly to the repaired hairline window crack.,
Clean the window with glass cleaner.

",How to Fix Hairline Cracks in Car Windows," There may be additional cracks that require your attention.;
, Bridge kits have suction cups at each end of the bridge that latch onto the window and are the best option for hairline cracks on vertical car windows. These kits are available at various auto supply, hardware, or retail stores.

, A metal probe works best for the cleaning process.

, Gently tap the metal probe so that the inner plastic layer of the glass is not damaged. This prevents further widening or spreading of the crack.

,, Secure the suction cups in place. Add resin into the crack using the injector or use the pressure and vacuum controls of the injector to suck air out of the crack while forcing the resin in. When the crack has been filled with resin, remove the bridge from the window.

, Windshield repair kit resin does not air-dry; it requires UV light from the sun or an artificial UV lamp to adequately dry.

, Use a cellophane patch, and cover the area that you just applied resurfacing resin to. Expose to direct sunlight or UV lamp, and allow the area to dry. After it is dry, remove the cellophane patch and gently scrape off the excess resurfacing resin with a razor blade to make it level with the surrounding glass to complete the car window hairline crack repair.

Note the signs of carbon build-up: longer start-up time and a gradual decrease in power.
,Do the following two steps to postpone cleaning the engine.,
Clean the spark plug and adjust the gap.,
Remove the muffler and clean the exhaust port.,
Keep using the engine, after doing the above two things.,
Besides the tools, buy a piston ring (or two) and some solvent - do not use gasoline or any other very volatile solvent.,Spray some lubricant on the cylinder head nuts and the muffler bolts and let it sit for awhile,
Remove the muffler and the cylinder head.,
Put the cylinder head back on.,
Clean the muffler and exhaust port.,
Put the muffler back on and replace the gasket here if necessary.,
When using those paste gasket seals with the gasket, be prepared to change the gasket for each decarbing work.",How to Decarbonize a Two Cycle Engine,",, Unscrew the spark plug and with a thin metal scrapper, scrap off the carbon. A close gap makes the engine easier to start but there is a resultant loss of power. The smallest pocket knife's blade could be used as a scrapper. Clean the carbon off the spark plug, replace if necessary. Spark plug do not have to changed frequently, as long as the gap keeps getting readjusted. The messy, time-consuming task of decarbonization keeps an engine going at optimal capacity., Use the metal scrapper or a small pocket knife., Eventually the engine will have to be decarbonized., Tools and Equipment: a ratchet set with and extension, paint brush, wire brush, assorted screwdrivers and a shallow pan to hold the solvent (kerosene, paint thinner, or some water soluble solvent are good choices).,, Remove all carbon. If the piston ring(s) is worn, replace it. It easier to clean the piston when it is removed. Whatever the case, be careful when sliding the ring over the piston, the ring breaks easily. The gasket between the cylinder head and the rest of the engine will not have to changed each time the engine is disassembled. If the gasket breaks, replace it., Look at the size of the four cylinder head nuts, they are small. Evenly tighten the nuts and have it seated evenly so there will be no leakage and to avoid warping the cylinder head. Do not apply excessive pressure when tightening the nuts, a torque wrench is not necessary. It is easy to break the rod (with threading on both ends) that the nut fastens on. If the rod does break, it will break at the threaded area. When the rod breaks on the other end it will have to replaced and may shear off to the extent that a vice grip will not be able to grasp it and twist it out. So,if the four rods with the threaded ends looks worn out, replace them., Disassemble and decarbonize the muffler is fast, because it is hardy and work on it can be rough and fast., Here also, do not overtighten the bolt and break it. If the bolt is worn, replace it, the cost of a bolt is trivial compared to the trouble of having to deal with a broken bolt., Gasket seals makes the gasket for one time use only. Any leakage can be seen by a carbon trail, so if there is no carbon trail, do not use a gasket seal. Bigger gaskets cost money."

Find out how long they have been in business at this location


Good tint shops prosper despite local competition by offering good service at reasonable prices.,
Inquire about the types of film they carry, and what type of warranty they offer.,
Try to visit a few tint shops to see a sample of their work.,
Get price quotes from a few dealers for the exact darkness, color, and type of window film you want.,
Make your decision and then remember to make an appointment with the tint shop before you tint your car.",How to Choose a Window Tint Installer,"






Find a tint shop that has been in business for 5 or more years at the same location. This shows a stable business that will be there years down the road if somehow the tint goes bad.






Often times, successful tint shops open car tinting branches in neighboring cities. Although the installers of the branches may not be the master tint of the bunch, since opening new shops means training new employees; however, branches are a sure sign of a successful tinting business.





;
,


Quality tint shops carry complete lines of window film from one or multiple window film manufacturers. They should carry dyed, hybrid, and metallic in a variety of colors and darkness. Beware of tint shops that only carry one or two lines of film, and sells them aggressively. They may have acquired this film on sale, and may not be thinking of your unique requirements and concerns.






The warranty on the car tint varies depending on the window film you choose. Try to install only window film backed with a lifetime warranty for materials and labor. Most films don't guarantee color and fading, it is recommended that you also choose one that does.






For the warranty to take effect, check out the window tint laws for your state. Illegal tint can nullify any manufacturer's warranty. When you purchase your tint, be sure sure you get a manufacturer's warranty card from the dealer with the date, the window film used on each window, and the total cost of installation as well as the receipt.







,


Tint shops can sound like the best shop on the phone, but 15 minutes on-site should tell you all you need to know.






Good dealers pay attention to customer service. They should be happy and willing to spend the time to talk to you and explain how their shops work. Remember, if they don't spend time with you now, they might not spend time with you when something goes wrong with your tint job down the road.






A tint shop's work area should be indoors and clean. Their tools and window films are organized in a professional manner. If the tint shop is outdoors or in a parking lot, this is a negative since it is critical to remove all dust and dirt from the windows before applying window film.






Take a look at a car they have already tinted, and look at the rear window. Is the window film applied in a single piece or is it cut into strips that surround the defroster lines. The best tint shops always apply film in a single piece. Look at the borders of the rear window, in many cars there is a black 'frit' edge on the window, Make sure the window film is securely attached to the frit as well.






Look for slices in window gasket material inside and out.






Look for nicks in the paint around the windows.






Pay attention to side-windows. The window film should be applied to the inside and be completely flush against all 4 edges of the window. Now look at the window film itself. Don't worry if the film looks slightly streaky and discolored, window film takes a couple weeks to dry out and become completely clear. If there are bubbles of air under the film or the film itself is not complete flat against the window, this is a sure sign of sloppy tinting.







, Never compromise because there are plenty of other dealers out there that will offer your perfect tint. With these price quotes and your research on each tint shop, make the decision.

, Even if they say ""drop-ins accepted"" or ""bring it over any time"", you want your tinter to be calm and prepared for you when you arrive. Tinting may take a couple hours to half a day, so either arrange a ride or go to a nearby coffee shop with a good book. Enjoy!

Remove any debris caught in the engine bay.,
Disconnect the battery.,
Cover exposed wiring or electronics.,
Let the engine run for five minutes.",How to Clean a Car Engine1," Before you begin cleaning the engine, remove any leaves, grass, twigs or other debris from the engine bay. This debris can become an issue and even cause fires if left to sit on the engine or electrical system long enough.It is common for pine needles and leaves to collect at the bottom of the windshield and then fall into the engine bay.
Look for small animal nests, particularly as the weather becomes cooler.;
, Spraying water directly into your engine bay could cause some of the electrical components to arc, blowing fuses or causing other damage. Prevent this by loosening the bolt on the negative terminal on the battery and sliding the ground cable off of the terminal.You may choose to disconnect the positive terminal as well to remove and clean the battery outside of the engine bay.
If you leave the battery in the vehicle, tuck the ground cable to the side to prevent it from coming into contact with the terminal.

, While your engine is fairly waterproof, wrapping plastic around some electrical components can offer you a higher degree of safety. Cover the spark plug inlets, loose wires and the distributor cap if your vehicle came equipped with one.Small plastic bags or plastic cling wrap work well to offer protection from water.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual if you are unsure if it came equipped with a distributor or where to find the spark plug inlets.

, Grease on the engine will be much easier to remove when heated. Start the vehicle and allow it to run for five or so minutes. This will allow the engine to get to normal operating temperature and loosen any stuck on grime.Don’t leave the engine running for too long, or you may burn yourself when you begin to clean again.

Apply engine degreaser.,
Avoid getting any degreaser on painted components.,
Allow the degreaser to soak in for three to five minutes.,
Use a stiff bristled brush to scrub stuck on grime.,
Rinse the engine with a regular hose.,
Wash the car.",How to Clean a Car Engine2," There are many brands of engine degreaser you can choose from, but most of them tend to work in the same way. Spray the degreaser on the engine from the bottom up, as this will ensure total coverage.Most degreasers come in a spray bottle to make spraying it on the engine easy and simple.
Read the instructions on the degreaser you purchase to ensure you use the best method for the specific cleaner.

, Engine degreaser can remove clear coat from paint, so be careful not to overspray while covering the engine. If you do get any degreaser on the fenders or other painted areas, rinse it off quickly to avoid damaging the paint.Degreaser can remove the shine from automotive paint.
Rinse degreaser off painted surfaces as quickly as possible.

, Engine degreaser works by eating away at the stuck on grime on the engine. For fairly dirty engines, three minutes is sufficient to loosen up stuck on grease and oil. For especially dirty engines, allow the degreaser to soak for five full minutes before rinsing.If the instructions on the degreaser you chose states a different amount of time, follow the instructions on your bottle.
The longer the degreaser sits, the better job it will do.
After five minutes or so the degreaser will begin to drip off of the engine.

, With the degreaser still soaking on the engine, use a stiff bristled or steel toothed brush to scrub away at any large deposits of grease, burned oil or grime. It should break loose fairly easily with the degreaser already applied.Wear eye protection while scrubbing the engine to avoid getting degreaser in your eyes.
Wear gloves to prevent prolonged contact with the degreaser on your skin.
You only need to scrub the engine if it has unusually large deposits of stuck on grime.

, Do not use a high pressure hose to rinse the engine, as it may disconnect wires or penetrate the plastic you used to cover electronics. A regular garden hose with the nozzle set to stream will rinse the engine effectively and remove most of the grime.If you rinse the engine completely and it still looks dirty, reapply the degreaser and allow it to sit for another few minutes.

, Once you have rinsed the engine off, you should begin washing your car immediately. This will ensure you clean any engine degreaser off of painted components before it has the chance to do any significant damage.Be sure to use a different bucket, sponges, rags and towels on the body of the car.
Wax any areas of the car that may have come into contact with degreaser.

Use a wire brush on battery terminals.,
Apply baking soda and water to battery acid.,
Use a stiff bristled brush and a sponge on plastic parts.,
Use brake cleaner to spot clean grime deposits.",How to Clean a Car Engine3," Battery terminals often corrode, which can lead to issues with the electrical system of your vehicle. Remove the cables on the battery and use a wire brush to scrub the terminals until they are clean, exposed metal.Soaking the ends of the battery cables in an anti-corrosion chemical like CLR can also help ensure a strong electrical connection.

, If the battery has corrosion caused by leaking battery acid, you can neutralize it as you clean by using a combination of baking soda and water. Pour a bit of baking soda into a bucket of water and mix it thoroughly. Dip your brush in the mixture and use that to scrub the battery terminals and any other areas acid may have leaked.Baking soda makes for an effective cleaning solution as well as a neutralizer for the battery acid.

, Plastic parts of your engine, such as engine covers and reservoir caps may be difficult to scrub clean. Start by using a stiff toothed, plastic bristled brush along with car wash soap or degreaser. Once the hard to remove grime has been removed, use a sponge with car wash soap to get the last of the grime off before rinsing the pieces with water.You may choose to remove the components to clean them out of the engine bay, but it is not required.
Avoid using steel toothed brushes on plastic as it may cause scratches.

, Brake cleaner breaks up grime and evaporates quickly. Insert the straw into the nozzle of the brake cleaner and direct it at hard to clean spots or areas where the grime is particularly thick. Use a hard toothed brush to scrub the grime away, then spray it again with brake cleaner to rinse it.Be careful using brake cleaner in enclosed areas as the fumes can be hazardous.
Brake cleaner is extremely flammable, so don’t use it while smoking or near flames.

Look for a high engine idle.,
Pay attention to low idle or stalling.,
Look for signs of a vacuum leak.,
Take note if the check engine light comes on.",How to Check an Idle Air Control Valve1," A common symptom of a faulty idle control valve can be a high idle. Start the engine and look at the tachometer on the dashboard. Most vehicle’s engines will idle at our below one thousand RPMs. If you are familiar with your engine’s normal idle, compare that to its current RPMs.If the vehicle’s engine is idling well above 1,000 RPMs, it’s probably too high.
Vacuum leaks can also cause a high idle.;
, Aside from high idle issues, low idle and even sporadic stalling can both be attributed to a bad idle control valve. Again, start the engine and compare how it is running at a stop to how it normally runs. If the idle is low and inconsistent, it may be due to an issue with your idle control valve.
Low idles could also be caused by vacuum leaks.

, If your engine is idling poorly, try to diagnose any possible vacuum leaks that may be causing it. Visually inspect the vacuum lines in your engine bay for signs of damage such as cracks or overly worn areas.Remove a vacuum line and connect it to a vacuum gauge to measure the level and consistency of the vacuum.
You can also try spraying a soap and water mixture on the lines to look for bubbling at the point of a leak.

, The check engine light in your vehicle is designed to turn on if the Engine Control Unit (ECU) identifies an issues with how the engine is running. Look at your dashboard; if the check engine light is on in conjunction with idle issues, it may be because the idle control valve is malfunctioning.The check engine light looks like a simple drawing of an engine.
A check engine light in conjunction with idle issues can be indicative of a faulty idle control valve.

Use a code scanner to check error codes.,
Start the engine and take note of the idle RPMs.,
Shut the car off and disconnect the Idle Control Motor.,
Restart the engine.,
Look for a difference in idle speed.,
Shut off the engine and reconnect the Idle Control Motor.",How to Check an Idle Air Control Valve2," If your vehicle was built prior to 1996, you will need an OBD I scanner. Vehicles made after 1996 will need an OBD II scanner. Connect the code scanner to the port beneath the dashboard and turn it on. Once connected, use the scanner to bring up the error codes making the check engine light come on.In some code scanners, it will provide the English description of the error code on the read out.
If your code scanner does not, you will need to look up the code the scanner shows you to find out what it is.

, Insert the key into the ignition and start the engine. Wait a minute for the engine idle to level off, then use a pen and paper to write down the RPMs that your engine settles and idles at.You may need to let the engine run for a few minutes in order for it to come down to its normal idle speed.
Keep the paper you write the RPMs on handy so you can compare it to the engine’s idle as you continue the test.

, With the idle RPMs noted, shut the vehicle back off and remove the key from the ignition. Open the hood and locate the Idle Control Motor. Once you locate it, disconnect it.The way to disconnect your Idle Control Motor will vary from application to application; refer to your vehicle’s service manual for more specific instruction as to how to disconnect it.
You can usually disconnect the idle control motor by unplugging the wiring clip going into it.

, With the Idle Control Motor disconnected, get back into the vehicle and start the engine again. The engine should still start and run without any issue despite the idle control motor being disconnected.Be sure to tuck the wiring you disconnected up in the engine bay so it doesn’t get caught in any moving parts.

, Allow the engine to run for a minute so it settles to a consistent idle, then take note of any difference in the idle RPMs versus the idle you observed earlier. If the idle has not changed at all, it’s likely because your idle control motor has not been functioning.If the idle control motor was working, disconnecting it should have created a difference in the engine’s idle.
This test confirms there’s an issue with the idle control motor, but not what the issue may be.

, If you identified a difference in engine idle RPMs with the Idle control motor connected and disconnected, confirm your hypothesis by reconnecting it and starting the engine again.The idle should go back to what it was when the idle control motor was last connected.
Refer to the note you took about idle RPMs to compare it to your first reading.

Use a test light to check the wiring on a GM idle control motor.,
Measure the resistance of the solenoid in a Ford.,
Use a bidirectional scan tool to increase idle speed in a Chrysler.",How to Check an Idle Air Control Valve3," Take a test light and connect the negative lead to the body of the vehicle. Press the test light into each of the four circuits on the GM idle control motor. Each circuit should make the test light flash or go from bright to dim while the engine is running.If the test light doesn’t flash on each circuit, the issue is coming from the ECU, not the idle control motor.
If the test light flashes properly, it means the idle control motor needs to be replaced.

, Locate the idle control motor in your Ford vehicle and identify the two electrical pins on the solenoid. Connect an Ohm meter to the two and measure the resistance between them.Fords are designed to operate with the resistance in the solenoid in a range between 7.0 to 13.0 ohms.
If the resistance is outside that range, the idle control motor needs to be replaced.

, Connect a bidirectional scan tool to the same OBD port you would plug a code scanner into. Use the command in the scan tool to increase the engine’s idle. If the engine idle does not increase, it means there is an issue at the idle control motor of its circuit preventing the signal from changing the idle.You can purchase a bidirectional scan tool at your local auto parts store.
Make sure the wiring harness is firmly connected to the idle control motor before conducting this test.

Learn to read the ID tag appropriately.",How to Identify a Ford Motor1," Valve cover bolts are the big bolts on the top of the engine, holding down the plate (usually marked ""Ford"") on top of the valves. The number of bolts corresponds to your engine type, which will help you locate the more useful ID tag.



2 bolts: 239/256/272/292/312

5 bolts: 332/352/360/361/390/391/406/410/427/428

6 bolts: 221/260/289/302/351W

7 bolts: 429/460

8 bolts: 351C/351M/400;
, The tag is a series of numbers and letters etched in and used to decipher the year, make, and model of you engine. It is found underneath the bolts on the left or right side of the engine, near the front of the car. You can find the tag here on all six-cylinder engines made after 1964, and on some V8 engines.The tag is roughly three inches long, half an inch wide, and made of aluminum.
If you are unsure what kind of engine you have, think back to the valve cover bolts as you work through the following steps. This will help you narrow down your options.

, Check under the dipstick, which is the small, plastic-handled piece that lets you check your oil.

, These are the last few places the tag might be. If it is not there, it may have been removed, fallen off, or only be visible when the engine is not in the car. Depending on where you find the tag, you can learn something about the engine:Indicator Bulb: 360, 330, 391 engines.
Dipstick Tube: 352 engines.
Carburetor Stud: 401, 477 534 engines., Once you've found the identification tag, you need to know how to read it to get the right information. Luckily, the tags are simple to breakdown. From upper left to bottom right:Cubic Inch Displacement (CID): The first three numbers, found in the upper left corner, tell you the size of the engine.

Manufacturing Plant: The single letter to the right of the CID is where the engine was built. ""C"" is for Cleveland, ""E"" is for Ensite, Canada, and ""W"" is for Windsor, Canada.

Year: The next two numbers are for the year the engine was built. 70, for example, would mean it was made in 1970.

Month Built: This hyphenated number and letter correspond to the month. The months are in alphabetical order, so A = January and M = December. There is no ""i"" so people don't confuse it the number 1. 0-A would mean January 1970, 5-C March 1975, etc. (assuming the year code is for the 70's).

Engine Code Number: This final 3-digit number is the ID of your particular engine. You can look up this code online to see the specs of your current engine."

Looks for nine-digit casting tags to learn more about your engine's make and model.,
Read the first two digits in the identification tag to find the year the engine was made.,
Read the third digit in the casting number to determine the engine design.,
Make sure that the fourth digit is always an ""E."" This digit stands for the type of part.,
Read the next 4 digits, which are the last digits in the motor number.,
Check the last digit, usually a letter, to determine the version of your part.",How to Identify a Ford Motor2," The casting tag is etched into your motor when it is created, and is used to help find the right parts if you need a replacement. This code also packs a large amount of information in it that will help you get to know your engine better.


You may need to clean the engine with a rag and some degreaser if it is too dirty to see the letters.
This code is usually on the side of the engine, but you might not be able to see it when the engine is in a car with older models. Use a light to scan both sides of the engine to find it.Ex.C5AE-9425-B, This will be a letter. If the letter is a ""B,"" it means that the engine was built in the 1950s. Each decade after that has its own succeeding letter; ""C"" designates the 1960s, ""D"" designates the 1970s, and so on. The digit after the letter is the actual year. So C9 would be 1969, E4 would be 1984, etc., This will be a letter, and it signifies the basic design of the vehicle as shown below. Of course, this code should match up with the car that it is in (ie. a Mercury could be coded E5M), but you may be dealing with standalone engines or redesigned cars.""A"" - Generic and full-size engine
""D"" - Falcon
""E"" - Truck
""F"" - Foreign Trans-Am racing
""G"" - 1961 to 1967 Comet/1968 to 1976 Montenegro
""H"" - 1966 to 1982 Heavy truck
""J"" - Industrial Ford
""L"" - Lincoln
""M"" - Mercury
""O"" - 1967 to 1976 Ford Torino/all Ford Fairlane
""S"" - Thunderbird
""T"" - Truck
""W"" - Cougar
""Y"" - Meteor
""Z"" - Mustang
""6"" - Pantera

, E stands for ""Engine,"" so this should always be the fourth digit you see when identifying Ford motors.

, These four numbers will always be between 6000 and 6898, which describes the part numbering of the generic engine assembly. Different parts of the motor will correspond to different four-digit numbers., If your engine is modeled after the original design, this letter will be A. If it is the third manufactured version of the engine, it will be a C, and so on. This digit can be up to three digits long. For example, AB would be the 28th version — 26 for A-Z, then two for A-B."

Break in new and rebuilt motors.",How to Change a Car Engine," While most projects done “under the hood” can be done beneath a hood that’s still in place, removing the engine from your vehicle is likely not one of them. The hood may interfere with your ability to access connections or bolts and will cause problems if you lift the engine out of the engine bay using a cherry picker or engine hoist. The hood will be held in place by hinges on either side, each with two or three bolts. You and a friend will need to support the weight of the hood as you each remove the bolts connecting the hood to the hinges. Once the bolts have been removed, lift the hood off of the vehicle.Removing the hood is a two-person job, as one person will have to lift each end.
Screw the bolts back into the hood to avoid losing them once they are removed.
Place the hood someplace safe, with cloth pads at each point it may come into the contact with the ground to avoid damaging the paint.;
, An engine uses a number of different fluids in regular use and all of it will need to be drained prior to removing the engine. Start with the engine oil, which can be drained through the oil drain plug on the oil pan. The coolant can be drained from the radiator petcock, though it’s important to note that there will still be coolant throughout the system as you disconnect coolant lines. The washer fluid reservoir is likely attached to the body of the vehicle, rather than the engine, and can be left alone.The fluids drained from your vehicle cannot be re-used in the new engine.
Drain engine oil and coolant into separate containers for later recycling.
You can bring oil and coolant to many auto parts stores to be recycled for free.

, The intake draws air into your engine and looks like a pipe or tube traveling from the air filter to the throttle body. Disconnect the pipe from the throttle body, then remove all the fasteners holding the intake in place and remove it from the engine bay. You may or may not need to remove the radiator in order to remove the old engine, but you will certainly need to disconnect the coolant lines traveling from the radiator to the old engine. The exhaust can be unbolted at the bottom of the exhaust manifold.Expect coolant lines to drip or pour coolant as they are disconnected, so place a container beneath each as you disconnect them.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual to ensure you have located and disconnected all necessary coolant lines.
Remember that removing the exhaust bolts can be extremely difficult. Spray the bolts with WD40 and use a breaker bar to remove them, but be careful not to break the bolts.

, Depending on the era of your vehicle, there is a wide variety of wiring possibilities that you may need to address when conducting an engine swap. The more modern the vehicle, the more wiring and sensors you’ll often have to contend with when disconnecting the engine. Be careful not to damage the connectors as you pull them apart, as they are usually made of plastic that can become brittle.Refer to a service manual specific to your vehicle’s year, make and model to ensure you disconnect all of the appropriate connections.
Older, carbureted motors may have fairly few wired connections to contend with, while brand new cars often have many electrical connections.

, Depending on how the engine is mounted in the vehicle’s engine bay, the transmission may either be behind or to the side of the engine. The bell housing of the transmission fits into place at the back of the engine, or opposite where you will find the serpentine or drive belt. Remove all of the bolts that pass through the bell housing of the transmission and into the engine block. Place a transmission jack below the transmission to support its weight once it is no longer connected to the engine.Be very careful not to strip the bolts that connect the transmission to the engine block, as it will be very difficult to drill and tap out bolts with broken heads.
Do not remove the bolts one at a time. Instead, loosen each of them a bit at a time until they are all hand loose before removing them.

, The engine in your vehicle is likely connected by three motor mounts, with the fourth serving as the transmission mount. These motor mounts are usually made up of steel and rubber (to absorb engine vibration) with a single bolt passing through the mount to secure the engine. You will need to use a wrench on one end of the motor mount bolt to hold it in place as you use another wrench to loosen and remove the nut from the other side. If you are using a cherry picker to lift the engine out of the engine bay, use your vehicle’s service manual to locate the points to bolt the chain to the engine without doing any damage, and put the chains in place as you remove the motor mounts.If you intend to lower the engine out of the bottom of the vehicle, you will likely need to remove a cross member and place an engine jack beneath the engine.
With the motor mount bolts removed, the engine will now be supported by the cherry picker or engine jack.

, Depending on the design of your vehicle, it may be easier to raise the engine out of the engine bay using a cherry picker, or to leave the engine where it is and raise the vehicle itself over it. If you are using a professional lift, raising the vehicle above the engine is fairly straightforward, but most home mechanics may struggle to lift the vehicle above the engine.Have a friend jack the engine up using the cherry picker, as you carefully guide the engine to ensure it doesn’t begin to swing dangerously.
Allowing the engine to swing around could cause damage to the engine or your vehicle and can easily injure you.
Be extremely careful not to get a finger or hand pinched between a swinging engine and the engine bay, as most engines weigh hundreds of pounds.

, There are two primary methods of locating a replacement engine: new or rebuilt motors or motors from donor cars. New and rebuilt motors can be purchased from a number of online retailers. Brand new motors are commonly called “crate” motors and offer the reliability of a brand new engine. Rebuilt or refurbished motors were removed from donor cars and disassembled to identify any issues, then reassembled with new gaskets. Both new and rebuilt motors are reliable, and both can often be bought with a warranty. Donor engines are often the least expensive, as they are simply removed from another car and placed into yours.Donor engines can sometimes be extremely easy to install, especially if both your vehicle and the donor vehicle are at your garage.
Crate motors are the most expensive, but offer the highest level of reliability.
Rebuilt and refurbished motors tend to cost slightly less, but are still considered quite reliable.

, Before installing the new engine, compare it to the one you just removed to ensure they match. Because the same vehicle may have come with multiple engines in the same model year and there may be dozens of variations over the years, it’s important to verify the new engine will bolt in exactly as the old one did. Look for the placement of the accessories (like power steering, alternator and air conditioning) as well as the location of the intake and exhaust manifolds and motor mount brackets.If the new engine is missing any accessory components like power steering, it may be easier to remove it from the old engine and install it on the new one before it is placed into the engine bay.
Engine blocks often have engine codes cast into them. If you locate the engine code, refer it to your vehicle’s service manual to ensure it is the proper engine for the vehicle.

, Place the new engine in the engine bay using the same method you used to remove the old one. If you are lowering the engine into place, have a friend slowly and carefully release the pressure in the cherry picker as you guide the engine into place. Take great care to slide the engine into place over the input shaft of the transmission without damaging it.The engine may want to twist in the chains as it is lowered by a cherry picker, so be careful to keep the engine aligned properly.
Do not release all of the tension in the cherry picker once the engine is in place.
If you lower the vehicle down over the engine, take great care to ensure it is lined up properly to avoid doing damage to the body of the vehicle or the engine.

, With the engine in place, slide the motor mount bolts through the motor mounts and secure them using two wrenches. Make sure to have all three motor mounts connected and tight before releasing the tension on the cherry picker and allowing the car to support the weight of the engine.Before connecting the new motor mounts, inspect them for damage. If the rubber bushings are cracked or damaged, you should replace them before installing the new engine.
Reduce the pressure on the cherry picker slowly to ensure the motor mounts will support the weight of the engine.

, Using the same bolts you removed from the bell housing of the transmission, connect the new engine to the old transmission. Make sure the transmission’s bell housing slides into place and is flush against the engine block and is not at any kind of an angle as you tighten the bolts.Refer to your vehicle’s service manual to find out the specific torque specifications required for the bolts connecting your transmission to the engine.
You may need to use a torque wrench to ensure you place the proper force into tightening these bolts.

, Depending on the make, year, and model of your vehicle, connecting the engine wiring harness may be a fairly simple or an incredibly complex endeavor. If the new engine and the old are exactly the same, it will simplify the process of locating and connecting each of the necessary wires, sensors and connections.New model vehicles have far more wiring to contend with.
Failing to connect the wiring harness properly can prevent the engine from running, make it run poorly, or affect the interior operations of the vehicle such as the gauge’s operation.

, Reconnect the coolant lines and all other connections you had to separate when removing the old engine. If you needed to remove components from your old engine to install on your new one, such as the intake manifold or fuel rail, be sure to connect these as well. Use your vehicle’s service manual to locate and connect all coolant, vacuum, and fuel lines that must be present to make your vehicle run properly.This is likely the most time consuming step in the process, as there are a number of connections to address.
Clearances should not be an issue with a replacement motor when running the connections.

, Reinstall the intake, connecting it to the air filter and mass airflow sensor (if equipped) on one end and the throttle body on the other. Many intakes are supported by mounting brackets that will also need to be secured.There should be at least one vacuum line connecting to your intake from the cylinder head, but some vehicles may have others.
There should be no open nipples or nozzles on the intake anywhere once installed.

, Reconnect the coolant lines to the radiator in the same way you removed them. Many coolant lines will require a hand wrench or phillip’s head screw driver to tighten over their respective pipes. Make sure all connections are tight, but be careful not to overtighten them and crack the plastic piping.If any of the hose clamps used on the coolant lines seem unusable, you can purchase replacement ones at most auto parts stores.

, An engine needs air, fuel and spark to run, so start by making sure the intake, fuel lines and electrical system are all installed and intact. Then start running through the rest of the connections you’ve made, ensuring each is tight and in its proper place. Refer to your vehicle’s service manual regularly as you compare its diagrams to what you see in your engine bay to be sure everything has been installed properly.If you see an issue, it may be daunting to take things back apart to address it, but starting the engine with something connected poorly or incorrectly can cause serious damage to your new engine.
You may want to ask a friend to look things over as well, in case they notice something you’ve missed.

, With everything in place, refill your radiator with a 50/50 water and coolant mix and add the appropriate amount of oil to the engine. Refer to your vehicle’s service manual for fluid capacities and ensure you meet them.With everything connected and the fluids refilled, the vehicle should be ready to run.
Turn the car over without letting it start a few times (by turning the key as though you want to start it, and then back quickly) to prime the fuel pump and being pumping oil through the engine before starting it for the first time.

, New internal engine components must wear together under certain conditions before they can perform their best. This is referred to as ""breaking them in."" Start by driving the car at varying speeds for the first two hundred or so miles. Then, take a few medium throttle accelerations up to around 4,500 RPMs and allow the engine to cool completely. Repeat this with heavy throttle a few times, and allow it to cool again. Then change the oil. Drive the car for another 500 miles regularly, without exceeding the red line for your vehicle to finish the break in.Properly breaking in a motor can prolong its life and ensure it performs properly.
Do not drive the vehicle aggressively until after you've broken it in for 500-700 miles.

Determine how the badges are fastened to the vehicle.,
Use hot water to soften the adhesive.,
Use adhesive remover to soften the glue.,
Use a hair dryer to heat the adhesive.",How to Debadge Your Car1," Many automotive badges are held on with a simple adhesive, but some utilize clips or rivets that pass through the body of the vehicle and can leave holes behind. The way the badges are fastened will determine how you go about removing them. If your badges include clips that fasten to the body, removing your badges will require body work that includes filling the holes and repainting that component of the body of the car (at minimum). This should be done at a professional body shop. While you can determine if there are clips or rivets used as you remove the adhesive, you have to remove much of the badge first to see if it is.You can often find out how your badges are attached to your vehicle by conducting an internet search. Try searching something like, “how to remove badges on a 2004 Mustang GT.”
Your vehicle’s repair manual should indicate how the badges are fastened in order to replace them if they are damaged.
Removing the trim on the interior of the body component will allow you to see if there are clips passing through the body of the vehicle.;
, Removing adhesive is much easier when it has been warmed up. One easy way to do so is to fill a thermos with hot water to pour over the badges. Make sure the water is hot enough to be steaming, but not boiling, as that can damage the paint on the car and burn you. Pour the hot water onto the body of the car, just above the badge. This will allow the water to contact some adhesive as well as to warm the rest of the adhesive through the badge. If you don’t have a thermos, you can use any type of water container as long as you get it to the badge before it cools.
Boiling water may damage the paint and could burn you. Use hot water, but not boiling.
Softer adhesive will let go under pressure and can more easily be separated from the body.

, You may also choose to spray an adhesive remover all along the edges of the badge. Adhesive remover can be purchased at most office supply or big box retail stores and can help when removing the badges as well as the adhesive that remains on the body after the badges have come off. Look for an adhesive remover you can spray on like Goo Gone or a similar brand. Spray the adhesive remover along the edges to allow it to seep between the badge and the vehicle, but don’t spray too liberally in the surrounding area. Adhesive remover will also remove the wax and possibly even the clear coat on the paint it comes into contact with.Adhesive remover will also come in handy when getting rid of the adhesive residue stuck on the body of the car.
Be careful not to get any of the adhesive remover in your eyes or mouth when spraying it.

, Plug a household hair dryer into a nearby outlet and turn it to its highest heat setting. Turn the hair dryer on and use it to apply steady, even heat to the badge you intend to remove. Swipe the dryer back and forth a few inches above the badge until the adhesive begins to soften. If the badge can move or twist under pressure, it means the adhesive is now soft enough to begin removing the badge.Make sure to heat the entire badge evenly so all of the adhesive attaching it to the vehicle softens.
Try to wiggle the badge with your fingers to see if the adhesive is loosening.

Pry the emblem from the body with a plastic wedge.,
Use dental floss or fishing line to cut adhesive.,
Use a credit card to cut the adhesive and pry the badge from the car.,
Use adhesive remover to remove adhesive residue.",How to Debadge Your Car2," With the adhesive softened, place a plastic wedge or scraper on the body panel of the car and press the wedge between the badge and the metal of the vehicle. With softened glue, the badge should pry up from the metal with fairly little force. You may want to approach the badge from a few different angles in order to make sure the adhesive lets go uniformly, otherwise you run the risk of breaking the badge.Be careful not to apply pressure to the scraper unevenly or you risk damaging the paint.
This method may result in breaking the badge. If you intend to sell or reuse the badge, you may want to opt for a different method.

, Take a ten to twelve inch length of dental floss or fishing line and wrap the ends around your index fingers. Pull the length of line between your fingers through the loose adhesive on the side of the badge opposite your body. You may need to create a sawing action my moving your hands back and forth to pull the line through all of the adhesive. Once done, there should only be a bit of adhesive residue left on the vehicle, but the badge itself should come off.Pull the line toward yourself, cutting through the adhesive attaching the badge to the body.
More force will be required to cut through the adhesive if it isn’t sufficiently warmed.
You will most likely be able to remove the entire badge without breaking it using this method.

, If you don’t have a plastic wedge or any fishing line, you can also remove the badge with a credit card. Once the adhesive has been properly warmed, slide your credit card under the badge and pry up slightly. Work your way through all of the adhesive by sliding your credit card around at different angles and separating the badge from the metal.Make sure the side of the credit card with the numbers is facing out so you don’t scratch your paint.
The warmer the adhesive, the easier it will be to separate the badge from the vehicle using your credit card.

, Once the badge has been removed from the body of the vehicle, there will still be residue left over from the adhesive that was used to attach it. Spray an adhesive remover like Goo Gone on the residue, then use a clean microfiber towel to rub the remaining residue off the vehicle.Rub the adhesive remover over the residue in a circular motion.
Be careful not to spray the adhesive remover in too large an area, as it will remove wax and can damage clear coat.

Wash the de-badged area with soap and water.,
Allow the area to dry completely.,
Ensure the vehicle is out of direct sunlight.,
Apply the wax in a circular motion.,
Wait for the wax to dry.,
Buff the wax off with a microfiber towel.",How to Debadge Your Car3," First, use warm soapy water to make sure no adhesive or adhesive remover remains on the paint. The wax will serve as a seal once applied, and you don’t want to seal the adhesive to your paint under a coat of wax. Use a sponge to scrub the area lightly, then rinse it thoroughly to ensure it is completely clean.Make sure to use soap designed for automotive applications, as things like dish soap will remove more wax and clear coat from the paint.
Ensure the sponge is clean of dirt and debris before you begin scrubbing. Any debris caught in the sponge can cause scratches in the paint.

, Once the area the badge was is completely clean, use a clean microfiber towel to dry it thoroughly. You may also want to allow it to air dry for a an hour or two before you begin applying wax, as it’s important for the paint to be completely dry before you can begin.Wax will not apply evenly to wet or moist surfaces, so wait until the paint is completely dry.
Some waxes are designed to work on wet surfaces, but these often do not offer the same level of protection.

, For wax to work properly, it shouldn’t be exposed to direct sunlight. Automotive wax performs best in cool, shady environments. It's important that the surface the wax is applied to isn’t too hot. If the temperature is too high, elements of the wax will dry out too quickly for you to effectively wax the de-badged area. Move the car so the portion you are waxing is in a cool, shady space.Waxing your car in direct sunlight will result in a worse final product and lackluster shine.
Be sure the metal of the car has cooled from when you were heating the adhesive.

, With the vehicle completely dry, use the applicator that came with the wax to apply a small amount of it to the area that was once under the badge. If you are using a liquid wax, you will only need a small dab for the area you are working with. Squeeze out enough wax onto the applicator to take up about the space of a quarter. Rub the wax compound into the paint in a circular motion.Ensure you apply the wax evenly to the area.
More wax does not necessarily mean a brighter shine. Only use as much wax as you need to.

, Once you have applied the wax evenly to the surface of the vehicle, you’ll have to allow it to dry completely before buffing it off. Some waxes are designed to dry quickly and may be ready to buff of in just a few minutes. Others may take up to a half hour. You’ll know the wax is dry when it becomes white.Take your index finger and lightly swipe it through the dry wax. If it rubs off onto your finger, it’s dry.
If the wax still sticks to the vehicle, allow it dry for another few minutes and try again.

, Once the wax is completely dry, take a clean microfiber towel and buff it off using a circular motion. As you remove the dry wax residue, you will reveal the newly shiny paint beneath. Rotate the towel as frequently as needed to avoid saturating it with wax residue as you buff the wax off.Do not apply too much force when buffing the wax residue off of the vehicle. If it is difficult to remove, the wax hasn’t dried sufficiently yet.
There may be some wax residue dust left over after buffing. Lightly blow on the body panel of the vehicle to remove the dust.

Keep a complete maintenance record for all repairs to your vehicle.",How to Communicate Effectively With Your Mechanic," You drive it, maybe you own it too. In any case, it's vital that you learn as much as possible as you can about this massive piece of machinery that you trust your life with.


Review the owner's manual of any car you own. Owner's manuals will typically provide a maintenance schedule for your vehicle, location of different parts and part numbers, the meaning of different buttons, and many other things you might have had questions about.
Learn the specifications for your vehicle, like the stock tire size, recommended tire pressure (not the maximum), and loading information. You should be able to find this information on a label inside the driver's door jamb.
Learn the names of different parts on your vehicles. It's most helpful if you have someone knowledgeable who can show you the different parts and what they do, but if not, looking up repair videos for your vehicle can help you with identifying different parts.;
,


Listing any pertinent information will help your mechanic with making a more accurate assessment of the vehicle's problem. You should make note of any abnormal sounds, vibrations, movements, and other tactile feelings. If you notice any lights on the dashboard, report those as well.

, Many mechanics would be happy to show you where and what exactly the problem is and entertain questions you may have as long as it is safe for you. Be sure to ask questions like:


How important is this to fix?
Can the parts be repaired or will they have to be replaced?
Is there a warranty on new parts?
How much time would it take to fix this?

, The estimate should include the costs of parts, labor, tests, taxes, and any other services performed. Note that an estimate doesn't mean that the actual price will be exactly the same - but it should be close, unless they get your permission to perform additional services on your vehicle.,, This is for the benefit of you, your mechanic, and any future buyers of your car.

With the window down, you’ll be ready to create a low-pressure area that sucks hot air out and cool air in., Rapidly push the door toward the car, stopping just short of actually closing it. Repeat six to eight times, then get in your car., Since air conditioning requires air to move over the condenser, running the air conditioning while idling will not cool your car very quickly. Driving around a bit will prepare you to cool your car as quickly as possible., Set the temperature to the coldest setting. Then, turn the air conditioning on to its highest setting. Use the fresh air setting (as opposed to the air recirculation setting).When you first turn the air conditioner on in a hot car, you’ll probably get a blast of hot air. After a few minutes, the temperature will begin to cool.

Use a seat cover.",How to Cool a Hot Car as Quickly as Possible2," If possible, always park beneath a tree, in the shadow of a building, or in another cool location. If you’re parking in a structure, try to stay off the top level (which is not protected by a roof)., Sun shades are foldable covers for your windshield. To use the sun shade, press it against the inside of your windshield. Open your sun visors to secure the sun shade in place.The best sun shades will be coated with reflective chrome to deflect the sun’s rays away from your vehicle.
Some sun shades have small suction cups in their corners to allow them to better attach to your windshield.

, Cracking the windows a bit can allow air to continue moving through the car, thereby preventing your car from heating up. Crack one, two, three or even four windows about one inch (two centimeters).Don’t crack your windows if you’re expecting rain.

, If you have dark brown or black seats, your car will absorb more heat than will a car that has light or brightly colored seats. To remedy this, invest in some white or light-colored seat covers.Seat covers are easy to slip over your seats. Like a bed skirt, they remain secure with built-in elastic bands around their perimeters.

Detach the lid from the grease trap gently with a pry bar.,
Inspect the grease trap's parts once the lid is removed.,
Insert a wooden dowel or measuring stick into the grease trap.,
Use a small bucket to remove any standing water from the tank of your grease trap.,
Remove the waste from your grease trap with the small bucket.,
Scrape down the lid and the sides of the trap with your bucket.,
Clean the lids, trap sides, and parts with soap and room-temperature water.,
Re-install the grease traps parts by following your diagram.,
Copy your FOG report for your records.",How to Clean a Grease Trap," Be sure to go slowly through this process, as there are gaskets for the grease trap located just under the cover. If you damage these, you will have to spend money to replace them.;
, You will be removing and replacing parts during cleaning, and you need to know where the components are located and how to install them to put them back in properly. For better results, it may help to draw a diagram of the trap's interior so that you can refer to during the re-installation process.

, Gently guide it to the bottom of the trap, and swirl it lightly in the trap so that the grease and oils mark the dowel. This can provide you with a guide to how much debris is in the trap.


Remove the dowel, and use a tape measure to determine how many inches of waste are present. Record the results in a FOG (fatty oils and grease) pump out report, which is issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

, If you prefer, you can store the water in a larger bucket or trash bin, and pour it back into the drain after collecting the waste.

, Scoop the bucket in to the trap, and bring out the solidified waste. Place the waste in a water-tight container, such as a heavy-duty plastic trash bag.

, Remove any large pieces of fat or oils that are attached to the trap. To achieve an even cleaner trap, you can use a wet/dry vacuum to suck out any smaller bits of waste.

, Use a steel pot scrubber to remove excess waste and odor. Flush the screens and parts with water to remove the soap and debris.

, Replace the lid once all the parts are secured and working.

, Mail the original to the address listed on the report.

Be prepared: In most jurisdictions every vessel, regardless of length must have at least a minimum amount of safety equipment aboard at all times.,
Be a prudent skipper: Do not take a boat out on a day that is too windy or when the waters are too choppy or rough.

,
Avoid sailing in channels or waters where there are lots of barges, tugboats, and especially speedboats.,
Anchor: Be sure that the anchor (and line/rode) that you have is of sufficient size and length to accommodate the size of your boat, or it could be dragged.

,
Drive a speedboat at a safe speed so that you can control the boat.

,
Stay Out: Do not take a boat in to places that are too swampy, especially if you see tree stumps sticking up out of the water, such as in coves or where the lake branches off.

,
Stay Clear: Do not take your boat into water that is too shallow for the draft of your boat.

,
If your boat has run aground, you'll need to be able to get the boat floating again.,
Tell someone: Be sure to let someone know if you plan to go boating alone, and let them know of your whereabouts.,
Stay Alert:Look out for people that are fishing, speedboats that are pulling water-skiers or tubes and swimmers.

,
Boating and Fishing: If you do some fishing on your boating trip, be careful when casting your line...especially with others on board.,
Be aware: Seaweed, rope or fishing line can get wrapped up and around your boat propeller.,
Be Weather-wise:Always check local weather conditions for boating safety before departure- TV and radio forecasts can be a good source of information.",How to Stay Safe While Boating," Be sure to have on hand one approved life preserver of sufficient size for every person on board and other floating devices. If you are going to be out in the boat after dark, make sure that your lights are working. You should carry a flare gun for any emergencies, carry a container to bail water, if the boat should spring a leak. Experienced boaters carry a wax toilet seal aboard at all times. In the event the hull is holed, form the wax seal into a ball and ram it into the hull from the outside. Simply smooth the wax from the inside to hold it in place. This will usually stem the water ingress until you can make port. If your boat has an engine and a cooking appliance, fire extinguishers are usually required.;
,, Wake/wave action have been known to swamp small craft.

,,,,, Therefore, it is wise to have on hand a large stick or a boat paddle in order to do that; thus you can push your boat off without getting out of the boat. Your anchor and rode can also be used. Simply take the anchor and rode (Don't forget to tie it to a bow cleat) out on a lifejacket as far as you can. Haul in on the rode and your boat should come free.

, Take a VHF radio and/or cell phone if possible.

,, Fish hooks can be very dangerous.

, Therefore, it is best to stay out of waters that have a lot of seaweed.

, If you notice darkening clouds, volatile and rough changing winds, or sudden drops in temperature, play it safe by heading for port as soon as possible."

Measure the area to be wrapped.,
Prepare the boat.,
Apply the shrink wrap film to the boat, starting from the top and working your way down to the hull, first on one side and then on the other.,
Apply belly bands.,
Heat the wrap.,
Check for holes.,
Wait for the wrap to return to the ambient temperature.,
Install a door, if desired.",How to Shrink Wrap a Boat," You may want to do this step with the boat out of the water. The shrink wrap will need to cover the entire top of the boat, including extra height for windshields and other protrusions down to an area on the hull below the rub rail. After you have determined the measurements for your boat, contact a shrink wrap manufacturer or boating supply store to purchase the amount of wrap you need and a heat gun if necessary.;
, You should plan to shrink wrap the boat in a well-ventilated area because of the chemicals that will be released during the shrink wrapping process. If you must install shrink wrap outside, try to do so on a clear, windless day to minimize the chances the shrink wrap will stick to itself before it is attached to the boat.


Tape over all fuel vents. Because you will use heat in the following steps, you need to be sure that there is no chance of fuel vapors reaching the heat source and exploding.
Pad any sharp areas. Sharp pieces sticking up, such as windshield corners, antennas, or ski pylons, could cause the shrink wrap to tear and prevent a good seal. You know your boat best, so be sure to cover any protruding areas with padding before beginning the shrink wrapping process.

, Keep the wrap folded in the box until you are ready to use it. Be sure to keep the wrap off the ground. Try to use 1 piece of wrap to cover the entire boat. If you must use 2 pieces, you will need to join them together with shrink wrap tape and heat, which will take extra time.

, Belly bands are straps that wrap around the boat, keeping the shrink wrap film tight. This allows for a tighter seal when the shrink wrap process is complete.

,


Begin at the bottom on 1 end of the boat. Moving the heat gun in a similar motion to spray painting, move up and down from the bottom of the shrink wrap to the rub rail, and work from 1 end of the boat to the other.
Repeat this process on the other side of the boat.
Heat the wrap on the top of the boat. Be especially careful around corners and on any objects that protrude because of a higher risk of tearing in these areas.

, Chances are, you may burn a few holes in the shrink wrap. Repair any holes with shrink wrap tape, following the instructions for your brand.

, Shrink wrap is flammable. You should keep a close eye on your boat until the finished project has returned to the ambient temperature and be prepared to put out a fire in the unlikely event that one occurs.

, Most shrink wrap manufacturers offer zippered doors that you can install after the shrink wrapping process is complete. These doors allow you access to the boat while maintaining a shrink wrapped seal.

Attach the Trapeze to the Pivot Stand with the provided spring pin, preferably to the first hole above the Trapeze level position.,
Attach the hook from the Winch Stand cable to the eye nut on the other end of the Trapeze.,
Install the provided safety chain around the base of each stand leaving 2 to 3 links of slack.

,
Lower the tongue of the boat trailer slightly to bring it down to lessen the bow end of the boats’ contact with the trailers boat hull supports while the bow is now starting to be suspended by the Trapeze.

,
Continue cranking the winch until the boat is separated from the trailer.

,
Use the raising and lowering of the tongue of the trailer and the lifting action of the Trapeze to accomplish the minimum amount of total separation needed from all trailer supports to safely pull the trailer out from under the boat.,
If your boat is on any incline the trailer will have a tendency to roll at this point.,
Immediately install boat stands as instructed by your boat stand manufacturer in accordance with their recommendations for your particular boat before going under the boat.

,
Leave the Portable Boat Lift attached to allow you to slightly raise the boat to reposition the boat stands for access to the boat hull where the stands were placed initially, or remove the Boat Lift while supported with your stands.

",How to Remove a Boat from a Trailer with a Portable Boat Lift,";
,,,,,, It is beneficial to start the operation with the Trapeze slightly higher than level at the Pivot Stand.

, Crank the winch one turn past a snug/tight cable; both stands should have their back legs pointing out, away from the center.

,,,, Check thoroughly that there is total separation from the front to the rear of the boat hull from all trailer supports before and during the entire removal of the trailer; your boat trailer guides may need to be removed.

, Be very careful when removing the wheel chocks and while pulling the trailer out so as not to have it jump right, left, backward, or forward while safely guiding the boat trailer out under the Trapeze and between the two Stands, and clear of the Boat Lift.

Study the methods of how to tie up a boat.,
Prepare the proper rope (or line) and use stern lines to secure the stern, spring lines to control movement fore-and-aft, fender ties to tie up the boat fenders and the correct bow and dock ties to fit the type of dock you will be using.

,
Slow down the speed of your boat when approaching the dock.

,
Determine the location of other boats in the area to avoid coming too close to them.

,
Locate the best part of the dock that will provide plenty of space for your boat.

,
Check wind and water currents to be sure you won't be thrown off course when preparing to tie up a boat.

,
Navigate your boat slowly to the docking location.

,
Turn off your boat's engine and begin to tie it up in the proper locations, depending on the type of boat and dock.

,
Tie each line with secure knots on the parts of the boat you are securing it to, as well as to the dock.

,
Work as quickly as possible to avoid any damage when tying up your boat to the dock.

This is especially important if you will be out of town during part, or all, of the hurricane season.;
,


Many factors go into this decision. Some factors include the size of your vessel, the strength of the threatening hurricane and the location of your mooring or a safe anchor area.

Consult your boat's manufacturer, if it is a lightweight boat, about filling it part way with water to weigh it down.

,


Secure your boat in all 4 directions if possible. Remember that trees are often blown down during hurricanes and might not be safe anchor points.

"
"
Move your vessel into a mooring field or ""hurricane hole"" if one is near your marina and set the anchor.,
Double all your lines and secure them to the sturdiest and highest pilings.,
Use chafe guards on the lines where they might rub against the boat and dock.

,
Install fenders on the boat to minimize chafing the sides of the boat against the lines or docks.

,
Remove items from the boat deck that can become debris during the storm.

,
Tether any items that cannot be removed and ensure any weight on the deck is distributed evenly.

,
Remove all cowlings and seal all openings on your boat.,
Charge all batteries and install backups to run bilge pumps during the storm.

,
Leave the boat and take shelter.

This will help prevent damage from docks, pilings and other boats.

,


For example, if you usually use 2 docking lines for your boat, you will want to use at least 4 to secure it to the dock pilings.
Use longer dock lines to account for rising tides and storm surges.

A successful boat transport company and their drivers must have combined experience working with DOT, permit agencies, marinas, boat yards, and ports offers better savings to you, by avoiding costly delays.,
Experienced, dedicated drivers have the knowledge and driving skills to transport your boat safely and professionally.",How to Prepare Your Boat for Transport," Proper preparation of your boat for transport requires careful planning and attention to detail on both the part of the owner and the boat transport service companies involved. It is the responsibility of the owner. Boat Transport companies do not typically prepare boats for transport. Marinas and boat yards personnel prepare boats and yachts for transport and typically will only allow their employees to prepare boats while on their property. If you need assistance with Preparing/De/Re-Commissioning your vessel, boat transport agents can help by working with you to select a Full Service Marina, Boatyard, Captain, or Marine Surveyor to accommodate your needs. If boat is not properly prepared for shipment, boat will typically be transported “as is” and carrier will not accept responsibility for any resulting damage.;
, A successful boat transport company and their drivers must have combined experience working with DOT, permit agencies, marinas, boat yards, and ports to offers better savings to you by avoiding costly delays.

, At the sole discretion of the driver, he may decline to accept any load which he believes to be inherently unsafe for any reason. Experienced, dedicated drivers have the knowledge and driving skills to transport your boat safely and professionally. They are all highly trained and experienced at transporting over width and over height boats nationwide. It is critical to the safety of your boat to be sure oversized yachts being moved use the required escorts and high poles when state regulations require them. Professional boat hauling and yacht transporting drivers know how the boat must be supported, balanced, stabilized and secured. They know how to properly distribute the weight on both the boat, and the trailer axles and how to correctly secure the boat to the trailer.

, The driver will complete a thorough condition check of your boat prior to loading and again at offloading.

, These boat transporting companies are grateful for:


Have the boat ready to load when the truck arrives at its scheduled time. Besides having to pay the driver for unnecessary delay, this also causes the boat transporting company to get behind on the other boats they have scheduled for transport. Transport companies do their best to deliver the boat at the estimated time. However, this is an approximation only due to the many factors beyond their control such as weather, traffic, permitted re-routes, and availability of marina operations for loading and offloading schedules.
Your participation and cooperation to prepare your boat for a safe transport as outlined in this document.
Boat transport preparation done by an experienced boat yard. We recommend for boats 30 feet (9.1 m) and up, the preparation be supervised or inspected by a licensed marine surveyor (see below for How to Prepare for a Marine Survey).
Understand that transporters will not be responsible for damage to or caused from improper preparation or loading by the shipper for faulty or defective cradles, trailers, chains, binders, or other equipment provided by the shipper to secure the cargo. This includes anything that shakes loose, becomes unattached, drops, falls or breaks.

Bear in mind these are not the result of driver negligence but are due to road vibration and high winds that are a normal part of boat transport and would happen no matter who was transporting your boat.


Your consideration that if your boat is being moved at 60 mph (97 km/h) into a 14 mile (23 km) per hour head wind, it is experiencing hurricane force conditions, as well as any inclement weather that may be encountered en-route. Please expect normal road dirt on the boat.

, When requesting a quote to transport your boat, the dimensions are extremely important. Please follow these guidelines for measuring your boat accurately:


In order to transport your boat for the lowest possible price, boat transporters try to carry more than one small boat going in the same general direction at the same time. That is why it is important for the boat transporter to know the full overall length of your vessel in order to know what boats will fit on the trailers.

, If on a trailer, include from the tip of the tongue to the end of the motor.

, The maximum height of many overpasses is 13 feet 6 inches (15.2 cm). Many oversized yachts require wide-belly low-boy trailers in order for the keel to set down low. Using these type trailers for tall yachts can sometimes be low enough to avoid using a pole car if the boat loaded is less than the state-by-state height restraint (the New England area has many low bridges and re-routes may be dictated by the Department of Transportation. Boats with an overall height greater than 13.6’ loaded on the trailer require special handling and routing. It is critical to measure from the bottom of the keel to the highest non-removable part of the boat. The DRAFT(from the waterline to the bottom of the keel) + clearance (from the waterline to the highest part of the vessel) equal the total standing height. Depending on your model, the fly or command bridge may need to be removed. It is important to measure the vessel without the bridge and also provide bridge dimensions to ensure appropriate transport space. Remember measure twice – cut once!!! #*The bridge should be placed somewhere suitable on the boat and make certain it is safely secured. If it must be placed on the trailer, a frame should be prepared for it to rest upon. If your radar arch is removed, it should be secured against your boat.


Consider using carpet to protect areas where surfaces may ""touch"".

, separately or securely stowed in your cabin, with all cabin doors, windows, and any other access, locked.

, The beam of your boat is the measured as the widest point of the boat including anything attached to the boat.

, Here are some basic questions to ask when choosing a marina for your boat:


Do they have a travel lift or forklift to load or offload your boat?
If necessary, can they shrink-wrap or cradle your boat for international transport?
Do they have a service bay for disassembly or reassembly of the radar arch or fly/command bridge?
Can they assist with the preparation of the boat for transport?
Does the facility have enough overhead clearance, free from low-lying trees and branches?

, Typically, once a rate to transport is agreed upon, a deposit payable to the Boat Transport company is taken to secure booking, boat coordination fee, and in some cases permits and escorts. Prior to delivery the full balance due is paid by certified check, cash (receipt provided), or wired direct to the Boat Transport company prior to offloading your boat.


Arrangements should be made to leave the check with a contact at the marina or the balance be paid ahead of time, prior to offloading if you will not be at the offloading destination. The driver will prepare a condition report upon loading and again at offloading, noting any obvious damage which you or your designated Agent will be asked to sign before the driver leaves. If there is damage to your boat, the freight must still be paid in order to file a claim with the insurance company.

, When in doubt pull it out! This includes valuables, all exterior electronics, Anchors, Antennas, Propellers, Flagstaffs, Outriggers, any item that extends beyond the stated length, width or height of your vessel, all canvas, screens, cushions, and weatherboards, radar transmitters, hailers, and dinghies.


Check the drain plugs. There should not be any water in the bilge while it is being transported.
Drain fuel and water tanks as much as possible. Be sure the tank is no more than ¼ full. During winter months, water should be drained from water systems, pumps, and air conditioners.
Disconnect the batteries and the cables tied off to prevent contact. If engine hatch covers are battery operated, they should be secured to prevent their opening while in transit.
Check for any loose items or items that could become loose.

, All locker doors should be well secured and locked. All items on deck should be securely lashed down. Normally the driver won't have a key, so any loose items will cause damage. We recommend, you lock the cabin and YOU keep the key.

, The carrier will not be responsible if they are damaged or if they vibrate off.

, The latches should also be taped securely to prevent the hatch from coming open while in transit and to prevent damage to the boat caused by rainwater through a missing or leaking hatch or deck. A boat will not sit in the same position on the carrier's trailer as it does in the water.

, Canvas covers, or loose cushion, can be damaged, or do considerable damage, flapping or banging around loose in/with the forced winds and truck movements, which may be even more greatly magnified, if added to any naturally occurring winds, and/or other weather conditions encountered during transport. Canvas covers must be removed as they will tear or fly off during transport.

, If you are moving your boat from an infected State, thoroughly inspect your boat. Check engine intake strainers, and all other through-hull fittings. Check drain scuppers, out-drives and all possible areas of attachment. DOT officers are checking boats for Zebra mussels at weigh stations. If zebra mussels are found, your boat will be seized. You will have to arrange for hot water removal, and you may also be required to have your boat launched first in salt water if your intended destination was fresh water.

, Shrink-wrap on oversize yacht transport is NOT RECOMMENDED. While Shrink-wrap can protect the boat from road tar and dirt, it is RECOMMENDED your money be spent on a good wash down at delivery. Shrink-wrap can and does tear or fly-off during transit. This can cause considerable damage from beating against the boat and chaffing. Drivers carry tape, and will try to repair it if possible. If they can't, they will have to remove it. Keep in mind that the driver's view is often obstructed, and at night he can't always see that the shrink-wrap has torn. Nor can the driver hear the shrink-wrap flapping or ""wind-milling."" They are not responsible for damage caused by shrink-wrap, canvas covering or any other cover. In some cases, you may be charged for the boat transporter’s time to remove the Shrink-wrap. Shrink-wrap is recommended for international boat and trailer shipping. While it is not necessary it is a good deterrent for break-ins and provides some base security.

, Dinghies can not be transported on its davits. The dinghy should be stored in the cabin or securely lashed and padded in the cockpit. If you are shipping a dinghy on board or if you have had to remove any superstructure, these items should be well padded. DO NOT leave dinghy on davits.

, It is highly recommended that wood boats be transported on their own custom cradle. This is suggested because there may be inherent structural weaknesses that are not readily visible or detectable. A well designed cradle will spread the weight of the boat over a much wider contact area. Wooden boats can be expected to dry out. A coat of linseed oil will help. Most boat transport companies will ask you to sign a release of liability for wood boats.

, Make certain that your wind-shield is strong enough to withstand the rigors and wind of travel. Confirm the seal is tight and screws holding it in place are not corroded. In some cases, oversize yachts are hauled backwards creating an even greater force of wind pressure. When in the least doubt ... REMOVE and SAFELY SECURE IT. Please NOTE: If not removed ... frame-less Plexiglas wind-shields WILL BREAK!!! Take precautionary measures!!! Any inboard/outboard or outboard motors should be raised and locked. It is sometimes prudent to place a 2 x 4 securely between your out-drive and bracket. Whenever possible, you should consider removing the props and safely storing them.

, Make certain that all Mast Poles are un-stepped and de-rigged. All cables and spreaders should be bound to the pole. ALL rigging, winches, wind indicators, and lights must be removed from the mast. The strongest side of the mast should be left ""clean"" to rest on our trailer. Wrapping of poles is optional, but should be considered. Carpet should be provided for the mast at the points of tie down. Expect some chafing at these points. If the mast is painted, it is almost impossible to keep the paint from chafing. The carrier will not pay to repaint masts if chafing occurs. Do not secure the mast to the boat, as there is a space on the carrier’s trailer for the mast. Should the mast be secured to the boat, the carrier will not be responsible for any resulting damage to the mast or the boat. Life lines, stanchions, bow and stern pulpits should be removed if they render the boat over height. On center board sail-boats, make sure the board is secured and will stay up in transit. Keel sail-boats may expect some separation where the keel joins the hull. This is not structural damage, but rather is the paint or filler cracking at the joint. Light built or racing sail-boats can expect some hull indentation from the support pads. These indentations generally disappear when the boat is returned to the water. Rudders, sticks, ladders, outboards, and anything else that can turn or flap in the wind, should be removed and/or well secured.

, There are options available for different types of overseas shipping: Ro/Ro (Roll-on / Roll-off): This requires your boat to be on its own trailer, or a trailer provided by the ship line. The cargo moves as one piece on a specialized trailer from port to port. Enclosed Container: Most liner vessels around the world today are full container vessels. If your boat fits the dimensions of a standard container (40' long, 7'8"" wide and 7'10"" high). These vessels are perfect for cargo that fits neatly into a standard 20'or 40' container. Flat Rack: This option is typically used for oversized boat. A cradle is built to support the vessel. A flat rack and strap is used to secure your boat to the vessel. We recommend shrink wrapping the boat to protect if from damage or debris getting into your boat during its international shipment. When shipping an oversized boat, we recommend that the manufacturer will disassemble certain parts from the boat such as engines in smaller boats, upper cockpits, bimini top, etc. Submersion: Your boat is loaded and unloaded directly from the water. Ship lines are on a first-come/first serve booking system and estimate the ship sail schedule and delivery. The time frames given are estimations and not guaranteed schedules.

, If you have a cradle for transporting your boat, please inspect it carefully for fit, loose bolts, strength and structural integrity. If your cradle breaks in transit, causing damage to your boat, the carrier cannot accept responsibility. They will not assume liability for any damage that results from the failure of your boat's cradle. If you are shipping your boat overseas, it is critical to use a knowledgeable, experienced agent well versed in overseas and international requirements.

, If you are transporting your boat on its own trailer, inspect your trailer to ensure it is roadworthy. Check tires for wear, dry rot and proper tire inflation pressure and be sure the tread is sufficient and that there are no cracks, bubbles or gouges in the rubber. If the tires are dry rotted, replace them. Old tires are tired, so replace them and avoid a costly and dangerous blowout. A spare tire is required. Remove wheels and hubs; inspect hubs for wear and rough surfaces, turn drums if necessary. Service or replace the wheel bearings. Many breakdowns occur due to neglect in this area. If the bearings have not been maintained on a strict schedule or it has been more than 6 months since they were last checked, please have this professionally done. Travel builds up tremendous heat in bearings that have not been properly maintained, easily causing their failure. Bearings exposed to salt water are especially vulnerable. Remove bearings; inspect bearings for wear. If you replace bearings, also replace races and seals. If bearings are OK, repack and install new seals. Trailers with surge breaks: inspect brakes and hubs for wear, replace brakes and turn hubs if necessary, also check brake fluid level. Check springs, shackles and bushings for wear and corrosion, replace as necessary. Remember, salt water will destroy trailer wheels, springs and axles if not properly rinsed after each use in salt water. Check all lights, plug must be in good condition, turn signals and brake lights must work properly, all marker lights must work properly, repair or replace as necessary. Check the lighting system for proper operation and make sure wires are in good condition. If repairs need to be made, have them done well in advance of the pick-up date. This work should be done by a professional or someone very knowledgeable on trailers. Please take the time to make your trailer TRULY ROADWORTHY. It is much more expensive if you break down on the Interstate. The Boat Transport Company cannot be responsible for your trailer if it is not in excellent condition. Please do not ask them to transport a boat on a trailer that is not fit for travel. They cannot afford to jeopardize their safety or equipment, or your boat. You will be responsible for any repairs, damage or problems caused by your trailer. Unnecessary breakdowns are far more costly than routine maintenance.

, Time and additional expense can be saved by preparing the vessel for inspection and making her more accessible. Arrange to present a clean, shipshape boat, and have all papers and miscellaneous gear ready. If applicable, you will need to make arrangements with the marina to haul the vessel for bottom inspection, and retain a captain for sea trials. Lockers and cabin areas should be cleared of all miscellaneous gear. The surveyor should never be asked to prepare a boat for inspection. The surveyor may request minor dismantling of interior ceilings, headliners, flooring, etc. in order to gain access to the suspected areas. Random removal and examination of below-the-waterline fasteners on wood boats may be required. Any dismantling and re-installation of parts should be performed by qualified personnel and is the responsibility of the person ordering the survey. Written authorization from the owner may be needed to board and/or to remove part of the vessel the vessel. Once you retain the Surveyor, he or she works only for you and reports to no one else. The Surveyor is there to protect your interest. Marine Yacht Surveying does NOT ""pass"" or ""fail"" vessels. The findings are reported, basic recommendations are given, and an opinion as to the ""Fair Market Value"" of the vessel is stated. As a buyer only you can determine whether the vessel meets your requirements based on our report. Marine Yacht Surveying does NOT make insurance or financing decisions. The surveyor reports observations which insurance or financing companies take into consideration to arrive at their decisions. Marine Yacht Survey Report should include:


A detailed description of the yacht and its systems.
Notes on conditions which affect the vessel’s value and suitability for its intended service.
Recommendations regarding safety, necessary repairs and maintenance.
Estimated current fair market value of the vessel. • Estimated replacement cost.

NOTE: These instructions are intended for those using an all chain rode.,
Pick the spot to drop your anchor by circling round the area watching the bottom contours on your depth sounder and looking for rocks or obstructions in what will be the swing radius of your anchor rode.,
Return to your intended drop spot, motoring very slowly, directly up wind.

,
Using reverse, stop all motion of the boat.,
If there is a breeze the bow will begin to swing off in a line, roughly downwind.,
When the appropriate scope has been released (approximately a 5 to 1 ratio, scope to depth) snub off the chain and let the boat settle back, bow to wind and anchor location.,
Put the engine in reverse at idle and allow any slack to be pulled out of the chain.,
Very gradually increase the engine speed in reverse to pull tension on the chain.,
During this process, observe two fixed reference points ashore, perpendicular to the boat and watch for any drag.,
If there is any drag at all go back to neutral, let the boat rest a moment and return to step 6 and try again.,
If there is not sufficient breeze in the anchorage to cause the boat to swing off fast enough to allow paying out chain evenly, you must use the engine in reverse to back down.",How to Set a Sailboat Anchor," (see ""tips"" below);
, Remember, you may well swing a full 360 degrees over time.

,, At the moment the boat stops, drop the anchor straight to the bottom as quickly as possible. Do not allow excess anchor chain to fall on top of anchor as this is likely to cause fouling.

, DO NOT USE THE ENGINE to back down because this will cause the chain to be laid down in an arc rather than a straight line. Instead allow the wind to drive the head straight downwind as you pay out chain. Do not release chain too fast to avoid creating piles. (If there is no breeze, see step 11, below, then return to step 6.)

, This may take a few minutes in a light breeze.

, (You should be able to feel this happening with a foot or hand on the chain in front of your windlass.)

, Start at about 1000 RPM. You will see the chain pull taut and then the weight of the chain will pull the boat back forward a bit. When this happens, increase the RPM by 500 RPM increments until you reach 2000 RPM.

, If there is no movement at full power for one minute and you can feel no little jerks in the chain you are well set. Shut down power and go fix a margarita.

, If this attempt is unsuccessful you must either try to find a better holding spot or start over. Chances are that either the anchor is located in poor ground or perhaps the anchor is fouled in some way.

, Do this at no more than idle speed. If you back down under more power the anchor is much less likely to take a good set and you will wind up just plowing a furrow in the bottom. This is the biggest mistake made in most people's anchoring technique.

Prepare the boat.,
Make a plan together.,
Unplug the trailer towing light assembly.,
Put the drain plug in the boat.,
Undo the hold down straps.,
Have your dock lines and fenders ready to go for immediate use.

,
Back the trailer down the ramp.,
Ensure that your tow vehicle has the parking brake set before exiting the vehicle.,
Lower the lower unit (for boats with outboard and inboard-outboard engines).

,
Turn on the bilge blower to remove any gasoline fumes that may have accumulated in the bilge.

,
Ensure that no person is near the engine when starting and that no person or boat is in your path before you put the boat in reverse.

,
Pay attention to currents, wind and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock.

,
Crank the engine.,
Secure the boat to the dock.,
Slowly pull the vehicle out.,
When pulling away from the dock, it is important to understand that unlike a car, the stern of the boat is pushed to one side or the other, whereas a car's pivot point is in the front.",How to Launch a Boat," Prepare as much as possible while the boat is on the trailer, and on dry land. Prepare the engine, fuel, safety gear, mooring lines, fenders, etc. You should be ready to drive the boat off the trailer right after it's backed down the ramp. Other people want to launch as well, and tempers will flare if you use dock time to do things you could have done in the parking lot. It is a good idea to have your own written checklist.;
, If bringing along guests, brief them on where to go and what tasks to do. If bringing along children, forbid young children and pets from playing or loitering on a boat launch ramp as this is a roadway that transitions into a waterway. Keep children and pets supervised by an adult in a different area than at the boat launch ramp. NEVER let children or pets play or be unattended at a boat launch ramp.

, Unplug the trailer towing light assembly from the vehicle's electrical system.

, This is very important!

, Undo and stow the hold down straps, but leave the winch hook in the bow eye.

,, This is easiest done with two people: one driving and one as a spotter. With a truck or SUV it can be easier to see when backing up if you put the tailgate down or open the rear hatch/door/window. Drive slowly, making tiny fine-tune steering corrections as you go. How far to back the boat trailer into the water depends on many factors - type of trailer, depth of the water, type of boat, etc. A good rule of thumb is to back in until the water is just above the hubs on the trailer. Be careful about backing in too far otherwise the tow vehicle might become stuck.


When backing down the ramp, have the vehicle in neutral. This makes it easier to control the vehicle quickly. If something fails, quickly put it in gear and go forward.

,


When getting out of the vehicle on the ramp, apply the handbrake first, check that it is holding fast, and then put it in park. When the vehicle is sitting in park, the whole weight is sitting on a little piece of metal in the trans (parking pawl). Should this break and the park brake doesn't hold, you launch the whole rig.

,,,,, Make sure the engine is in the water, and turn it over. Once it's running, undo the winch hook from the bow eye, and back the boat out of the trailer. For smaller boats, you can just push the boat out while holding a mooring line.

, Tie the mooring lines to cleats on the dock. Use fenders to prevent the hull from being scratched.

, Boat ramps can be slippery with moss and algae and it is important to not let the vehicle's tires spin. If your tow vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive, this can be useful if your back tires start spinning. Once the boat is afloat and secured to the dock, drive the vehicle back up the ramp and park it at the landing, in the designated parking area.

, Do not turn the boats steering wheel in the opposite direction of the dock, with the boat a mere few inches from the dock, and just hit the throttle - or your engine's outdrive will push your boat right into the dock, scratching or gouging the gelcoat in the side of the hull. Make sure that you have pushed away several feet from the boat dock before driving away, so that your stern has ample room to turn the boat without scraping the boat alongside of the dock.

Practice backing the trailer.,
Ask questions.",How to Load a Powerboat on a Trailer1," Backing boat trailers is essential to the powerboat loading process. The biggest key is to go slowly, which can be difficult when many other boaters are waiting to use the ramp. For this reason, it makes sense to practice somewhere else. Take your trailer (with or without the boat) to an empty parking lot and practice backing until you are comfortable.;
, Your relationship with your boat dealer shouldn't end when you drive off the lot. Ask for specific tips about loading your powerboat.

"
"
Back the trailer slowly onto the ramp.,
Stop when the wheels are almost completely covered by water.,
Put the car in park and set the emergency brake.

,
While piloting the boat, on the final approach to the trailer, pay special attention to wind, currents and waves that can easily pull your boat off course and into a collision course with another boat or dock.,
Pilot the boat slowly towards the trailer, alternating between a slow idle, neutral and reverse if necessary.

,
Drive the boat onto the trailer until it is close enough to attach the winch hook to the handle on the bow of the boat.,
Attach the winch hook to the handle.,
Stop when the bow of the boat is touching the winch.

,
Secure the boat to the trailer.,
Take out the drain plug.,
Very slowly drive the tow vehicle with trailer and boat forward and out of the water.",How to Load a Powerboat on a Trailer2," If possible, have a helper ensure you are centered on the ramp and backing straight.

, The precise position depends on your boat, but this is a good starting point.

,, Anticipate the direction of these forces and steer into them to offset their effects on the direction that your boat will travel with the idea towards landing squarely between the rails of your trailer.

,, Drivers who are inexperienced at powerboat loading tend not to give the boat enough gas when driving onto a trailer. Don't be afraid to drive what feels to be a little too fast.

, Working as a team, the powerboat driver should slowly drive the boat forward while the assistant cranks the winch.

,, You will make sure your boat is safely attached to the trailer with different clips and straps depending on the make and model of both your boat and your trailer. Be sure to check your boat owner's manual to be sure you are attaching the boat to the trailer correctly.

, The drain plug at the stern of the boat needs to be in when you are in the water, but excess water will drain out of the boat if you remove the plug before you drive away.

, Boat ramps can be slippery with moss and algae and it is important to not let the vehicle's tires spin. If your tow vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive, this can be useful if your back tires start spinning.

Before you start you do have an easy option: Bring the boat to the company who put the lettering on and have them remove it.,
If you don't want to take the boat to a company, then you can try for yourself.,
This way also works but will leave a sticky adhesive residue.,
Of course, even if you get all the letters off with the razor blade there will be a sticky residue.,
Spray with GooGone or WD 40, either of these substances will remove almost anything with an adhesive backing.

",How to Remove Stick On Lettering from a Boat," This is usually very cheap and convenient if you need new graphics put on anyway.;
, Start with a hair dryer or heat gun. (Be very careful when using a heat gun as they have the power to blister gelcoat.) Heat up the surface of the sticker then while heating the sticker slowly start to peel back the sticker with your nails or a razor blade once you have it started it is best to use your hands and slowly pull while heating what is still sticking this method will leave no sticky residue.

, Start with a razor blade It is usually best to get the long, skinny razors with extend able blades, but this does depend somewhat on personal preference. The short fat ones work as well. Try slipping the blade under the letters. Most letters you should be able to get off this way. As long as you are careful, you shouldn't have a problem scratching the fiberglass, but watch what you're doing with the blade.

, This is an easy problem to solve. A product like mineral spirits, lacquer thinner or a cleaning alcohol on a rag should make the sticky residue rub right off.

If your rear wheels start spinning try to get more weight in the back if possible.
If all else fails then you'll have to do a burnout to get the tires hot so they will stick to the ramp better.

"
"
Put the car in 1st gear.",How to Get off a Slippery Boat Ramp5," On Automatic cars just put the Shift Handle all the way down to 1 or L in some cars.


Give it gas and hold the brake a little too so you won't slide back into the water.
Give enough gas to get the wheels spinning real fast but don't over rev your engine. Watch the RPM meter to make sure it doesn't redline.
Shortly your vehicle should start inching forward up the ramp. If you're still not moving then let off the gas and hold the brake. Then slowly give it gas trying not to burnout.
If all this fails then you'll need to find someone that's capable of pulling you out.

Put your vehicle in 4WD.,
Put the vehicle in drive and give it gas to get up the hill.",How to Get off a Slippery Boat Ramp6,",, 4WDL will help too, it's a lower gear so it will help give you torque for climbing the ramp hill.

, If 4WD isn't enough, load as much as you can into the back of the vehicle for more traction and get as much weight out of the boat as you can so it will be easier to pull out.

Wash off its exterior thoroughly with fresh water as soon as possible, after safely removing the PWC from the water, Use some car wash and a wash mitt if you have time, but be absolutely certain that no salt water remains on the PWC.,
Allow the engine to cool down before flushing.,
Unscrew your PWC's drain plugs.,
Hook the hose up to the water injection port (the flushing port).,
Ensure your PWC is secure to the trailer.,
Open the port on the carb silencer - it is usually a small rubber gasket that can easily be opened by hand.,
Coat the entire engine, the ""business end of the PWC"" (including the impeller, the jet gates, the reverse gates, and all the exposed metal in the rear of the PWC), and all cables and linkages with a thin coat of silicone lubricant.,Apply a vinyl treatment to your vinyl seats - this can be from an automotive store, or a boating supply store, but protect those seats from cracking, fading and wearing thin!,
Fill your PWC with gasoline and Oil (especially if it's a two stroke).,
It is a very good idea to use a fuel stabilizer gasoline additive.",How to Properly Flush a 2 Stroke Jet Ski/Sea Doo/Waverunner/Personal Water Craft," Spend extra time washing out the ""business end"" of the PWC - the jet nozzle, the reverse gate, the impeller, the ride plate.
, Flushing a hot engine can cause small stress cracks in the cylinder due to the differential expansion between the aluminum cylinder and iron liner., Open your PWC's hood - wash the engine bay down with fresh water - be sure not to hit the electrics with direct spray., Do not turn on the water. (IF you force water into the motor without it running, water can and will backtrack up into the carb and cylinders causing hydro-lock.) Start the engine; let it idle for a few seconds. Then, with engine running, turn on the water. Ensure that water is flowing out of the exhaust, the impeller grate, and the cooling port(s). Let the motor run at idle for approximately 8-9 minutes. After this time has passed, remove the hose. Let the engine run another 5-6 seconds, then stop the engine., Tilt the PWC back on its trailer. This allows all the gathered water inside to run out. Hold the trailer at an angle for approximately 3-5 minutes. Once it is back level, use shop towels or rags to dry off the entire engine bay/battery compartment/exterior., Start the engine, and let it run for 1-2 seconds. With the engine idling, shoot a little bit of ""FOGGING OIL"" into the port. (The engine will bog down for a second, and then resume its normal idle). Spray another little shot of fogging oil in, the engine bogs down, and then it picks back up. Once the engine is idling again, stop it., (Many people use WD-40 for this, or CorrosionPro Lube.) Any light oil that displaces moisture will work - this is just to seal the metal off from any corrosion causing moisture.,, Leaving these tanks with empty space is just asking water and condensation to form. Be safe, keep them stored full!, While it is almost imperative to treat your gas if you are not planning to use your PWC during the off-season, etc., it is a good practice to always treat your gas since the stabilizer significantly slows the absorption of water vapor from the air. You are done - cover your PWC with a tarp or a provided cover and call it another great day on the water."

Remove your boat from the water.,
Use a handheld, stainless steel scrubber to scrub gently until all barnacles are removed and all you see is the ship's hull.

,
Remove larger barnacles with a plastic putty knife.,
Remove remaining barnacles with a stainless steel scrubber.

,
Purchase a pressure washer to remove large colonies of barnacles.,
Spray parallel to the boat hull rather than directly at the barnacles.,
Apply a small amount of hydrochloric acid to any barnacle remnants after pressure washing.,
Apply a lime remover after applying the acid.

,
Wash the boat's hull thoroughly.

,
Apply a product designed to make the hull of your boat slick.,
Finished.

",How to Remove Barnacles," Barnacles can only be removed when the boat is still moored if you have the proper diving equipment.;
,,


Start with a plastic knife so there is less chance of gouging or scraping the hull of your boat. If it is ineffective against the barnacles, move up to a metal knife with dull edges.

,, Allow your boat several weeks to dry, if possible, before pressure washing.

, You want to get underneath the edge of each barnacle. Focus on small patches until you've pressure washed the entirety of the boat.


This pressure washing process will likely remove some of the paint on your boat. You should be prepared, therefore, to repaint after a thorough pressure washing.







, After applying, scrape off remaining barnacle plates with your plastic or dull-edged metal knife.

,,, This will make cleaning barnacles off your boat that much easier in the future.

Note that there are a number of methods used to apply vinyl boat lettering to the transom of your boat.,
Go online and search for wet release boat name decals.,
Look for a wet release system, you can nearly guarantee a perfect job every time.,
Clean your boat transom or the sides of your boat that will receive the decals.

,
Mix a solution of 1 cup of water and about 6-8 drops of Palmolive dish washing detergent.,
Hold your decal into position and play with it with the backing still on until you get it in the exact position you want.,
Spray the boat with a good heavy coating of your solution mix.,
Place the decal in position.,
Starting in the center, gently squeegee out the solution first working to the right, then to the left.,
Notice that the application masking that holds your boat name letters in place will begin to turn milky and break down with the solution (the letters themselves are not water soluble, they bond firmer as they dry while the pre-masking breaks down) This process can take a few minutes to an hour or more.,
Wait.",How to Install Boat Name Lettering and Decals," While it is fairly easy to install small letters using a dry method, you are far better off using a wet release method providing your supplier offers this goof proof method of installation.;
, Some websites allow you to actually design your boat name lettering online, see it on a boat, then order it.

, The most difficult part of installing the boat name is that boat names are fairly large decals and it's real easy to tangle them or accidentally seal in large bubbles of air, which is a disaster. Not so with a good wet release system.

,, Place this solution in a spray bottle. Bring this along with your wet release boat name lettering or registration number decal and a Rubbermaid kitchen spatula or other rubberized straight edge.

, Once in place, use black tape or any contrasting color tape to mark your position.

, Also spray the decal (sticky side) as you pull the backing away. This will prevent the decal from immediately bonding to the boat or to itself if you should fumble finger the thing.

, Slide it around until it hits your marks made in step 6.

, Once you are comfortable you have pushed out all the solution you can begin to push firmer and firmer. Go slow. The solution may be pushed out but the decal still has not bonded yet.

, Take a break. Cover the whole decal with a moist towel or at the very least, shade it from the sun. Time and moisture will cause the pre-masking to release both from the boat and from the decal.

, In about an hour, you should be able to pull the pre-masking off the decal and the letters will stay firmly in place.

Get the boat ready for caulking.,
Clean out all the old putty and caulking cotton with the raking iron, taking care not to damage the wood.

,
Prime the seams with the oil based paint or with red-lead paint.

",How to Caulk an Old Wooden Boat1," If you intend to repaint your boat, strip off the paint before starting to re-caulk.;
,,"
"
Different builders have differing ideas on where to start caulking.

,
Some like to do all the butt ends first then start on the lower seams and finish off with the rabbet and garboard seam.

,
However, here is no reason why you should not start on a seam above the water line, if you want to get into the swing of it first.

,
The main thing is remembering which seams have been done and which are still to do.

,
How many strands of cotton you use will depend on the size of the seams.

,
Ideally the cotton should fill the deepest third of the seam.

,
This means that when tapping it home the iron should go in by about two thirds of the plank thickness.

,
Add or subtract strands as needed.

,
But always remember that it is to be tapped in not hammered.

,
Don’t over caulk, the cotton and the wood are going to swell when wet.

,
Some authorities suggest laying out enough cotton to do a full seam.

,
That is fine if you are laying it out in a perfectly clean floor.

,
The cotton is rather hairy and will pick up any and every bit of dirt or wood shaving on the floor.

,
I found that it was better to feed it straight from the ball, but keeping the ball in a cardboard box which can be pushed along with your foot as you go.

,
If you have to join strands mid seam do not tie a knot, this will produce a thick, hard lump.

,
Simply roll the ends together between finger and thumb.

,
Start off by using the paying iron to tack or loop the cotton loosely into a foot or two of the seam.

,
Then go back and using a rocking action with the iron tap the cotton home with the mallet.

,
If there are any wide seams leave them for last.

,
By caulking all the tight seams first you could find that this has caused the wider ones to close up.

,
Wide seams can be caulked in two runs, thus increasing the number of strands.

,
Some builders suggest priming the cotton before applying the putty.

",How to Caulk an Old Wooden Boat2,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"
The traditional compound for stopping seams is linseed oil putty mixed with red led powder.

,
When mixing this caulking compound take a tennis ball sized dollop of the putty mix enough red lead powder to give an even red color add linseed oil if needed to keep it soft.

,
Then add a thumbnail sized dollop of multi-purpose grease, mix it well and push it into the seam with a putty knife.

,
The grease will help keep the putty soft and flexible thus preventing any hardening and cracking later.

,
You can either smooth the putty flush with the planking or used a curved scraper to produce a concave seam.

",How to Caulk an Old Wooden Boat3,",,,,"
"
When it comes to launch day you might find that some of the seams have opened up.

,
Do not be tempted to add any more caulking cotton.

,
You can add some more of the paying compound but this will probably end up being squeezes out as the wood and cotton take up.

,
Providing the gaps are not excessive its better to use a temporary method of stopping.

,
Taping over the cracks with masking tape will slow water intake sufficiently while the planks take up.

,
Or fill the cracks with soap, use bar soap rubbed into the crevices this will eventually just wash away.

,
How quickly she takes up will depend on the wood of the planking.

,
Soft woods will usually take up faster than hardwood.

,
My first attempt at re-caulking a complete hull was on Mignonne, she has been in the water now for three years and she is still afloat and watertight.

,
If I can do it anyone can, with a little care you can do it too.

Wash your boat regularly.,
Use soaps and cleaners made just for boats to protect your boat’s finish.

,
Change your boat's oil regularly.,
Check the propeller as part of your pre-launch routine (If you have an outboard or stern drive boat).,
Remove the propeller several times during the season to make sure discarded fishing line hasn’t become wrapped around the propeller shaft.,
While you have the propeller off, inspect it for nicks, dents and other signs of damage.,
Put a liberal amount of waterproof grease on the propeller shaft and re-install the propeller and hardware in the same order that you took them off, and tighten the propeller nut to the manufacturers specifications.",How to Maintain Your Boat," And if you boat in saltwater, rinse your boat thoroughly with fresh water after every outing to remove salt residue.;
,, Four-stroke outboards, inboards and stern drive boats require regular oil changes. The frequency will vary by model, but a good rule of thumb is to change the oil every 100 hours of operation or at least once a year.

, Use a deep socket to make sure the propeller nut is secure.

, If it has, have your dealer inspect the gear-case, because fishing line can cause gear-case leaks and gear-case service is not a do-it-yourself job.

, It’s OK if your prop is missing paint, but send it out for repairs if you find signs of impact. The smallest dent can cause your boat to lose 10% of performance and will burn more fuel than normal.

, Do NOT forget to put a new cotter pin in if you have an outboard.

The most important features are the ability to play mp3 and WMA format files burnt on a CD but also from a USB drive (thumb drive or removable hard drive). Another important thing to consider when upgrading your head unit is what aftermarket unit will fit best.


Head units come in three sizes - Single DIN, DIN and a half, and Double DIN. If your unit is Single DIN it will likely be compatible with most aftermarket head units. Otherwise you may need a mounting kit for your vehicle.;
, This will allow the car radio wiring to plug into the back of the new radio. These can sometimes be found for $4.99. Make sure that the plug is compatible with your car (check the list on the back of the box).

, Twist the correct wires together and then solder them (or use wire nuts if you do not have soldering equipment). Cover the exposed wire with electricians tape or heat seal tape., This will likely consist of having to pry away a plastic cover panel on the front of the radio and take out two screws. This will then allow you to slide the radio out of the dash. If you are unsure how your radio comes out, you should consult a service manual for your specific model.

, This will be easily done once you slide the radio head out of the dash.

, These plugs go to the back of the radio and can be released by pressing the release tab and pulling out.

, If the sides of the radio have mounting brackets, remove them from the factory radio. make sure that you mark which one goes to the left of the radio and which one to the right.

, This will allow you to fit your wiring harness to your new aftermarket stereo head., There is a place on the back of the radio head for a plug. That is where you will plug the adaptor in., Do not forget to plug the antenna wire into the large round hole in the back of the radio head. This will allow you to pick up AM/FM stations.

, Be sure that you can hear sound through the speakers. See if the radio lights come on. This indicates that power is getting to the radio. Also confirm that the antenna is plugged in properly by tuning to different FM and AM stations.

, Mount the new radio with the same screws as you took out of the old head unit, unless you had to use a mounting adaptor. Now you have installed your new stereo head unit.


For most Toyota models, including Corolla, you will need to use a dash install kit for single or double DIN stereos., This step varies by model, so be sure to consult your service manual if you are unsure about how to proceed.

Depending on the size of the boat, often people will create a framework in order to support a tarp or when shrink wrapping a boat.

Uncover the boats tarp or shrink-wrap carefully, avoiding rips or tears.
If needed, take pictures and label parts of the framework so it can be reassembled and reused the next year.
Disassemble the framework and store materials.



 

;
, Performing a general inspection of the exterior of the boat can be very helpful when determining what things need to be done. If the boat had been covered properly for the winter, a general cleaning, waxing, and painting should be the only necessary procedures needed to make the boat look good again.

Check the condition of the fiberglass for light dirt, dark stains/streaks to determine the type of cleaner needed.
Inspect the exterior wood to determine if it needs to be refinished.
Check the bottom of the boat to see if it had been painted with an anti-fouling paint (this procedure is necessary if the boat stays in the water during the summer season).

, Make a list of supplies you think you need based on the assessments made and head to your local marine store. If you are unsure of the right supplies you need, the employees at the store can help you choose the right products to complete each task.

Take inventory of what supplies you already own.
Compose a list of supplies you do not possess and what you may need more of.

, Boats can be made of different materials (fiberglass, plastic, wood). For each type there are different ways to protect it and keep it looking new. The most common material used to build boats is fiberglass. If the boat is made of fiberglass, it is necessary to reapply wax yearly to keep it protected from the elements of the water and the sun.

Wash the exterior of the boat from top down with a mild boat soap and water (for the stubborn spots, there are stronger spot cleaners you can use).
Let the boat sit and wait until it is completely dry before moving on.
Apply the protective coat of wax, either by hand with a rag or using an electric buffing tool (wax can be in a paste or liquid form, choose what is best for you).












, Many boats are made with the bottom half of the exterior covered in paint. This acts as another form of protection against external elements. When preparing your boat, another way to protect the outer layer of the boat is to reapply a fresh coat of paint to prevent things such as algae growth if the paint is either chipping away or fading. If the bottom of the boat needs painting first get the boat ready to paint.

Use blue masking tape to tape off the top edge of the paint line.
Scrape off any loose paint and lightly sand the bottom.
Rinse off the bottom and let it sit to dry completely before moving on.
Paint the bottom using the proper paint, brush, roller and clothing for the job.







, Many boats have accent wood pieces (such as teak wood) located around both the inside and outside of the boat. A lot of times with the sun beating down on them, those pieces can start to fade, looking dull and slightly grey. They can be restored by sanding and staining them. You can usually mask off surrounding fiberglass and restore small accent pieces without trying to remove them; however, some larger sections may need to be removed and restored outside of the boat.

Unscrew and remove any large pieces of accent wood.
Use masking tape to tape off surrounding fiberglass (if you plan on leaving smaller accent pieces in place).
Sand all pieces of wood (large and small) either by hand with sandpaper, or with a small electric palm sander.
Clean away dust particles with a small vacuum and wipe with a dry cloth.
Apply the new finish of your choice based on the manufactures specifications.
Remove masking tape and reinstall the pieces that were removed.












, Now that the exterior of the boat is prepared and ready for the upcoming season, the next step is to perform a visual inspection on the boats engine(s) and mechanical systems. If your boat has an internal engine(s) it is typical that these engines were filled with some type of antifreeze to protect them from winter temperatures.

Perform a visual inspection of the engines, looking for any leaks (if leaks are present this could be a result of improper winterization).
Contact a mechanic to determine what repairs are needed (if leaking occurs); or if there are no present leaks, proceed on to next inspection.
Open and close the water supply valve(s) located down in the hull (typically at its lowest point) to make sure the valve(s) operate properly.
Leave the valve(s) in the open position (if they operate smoothly).
Inspect all cooling system hosing for cracks.
Check engine fluids for proper levels.







, Many modern boats have more than one battery that are typically located deep in the hull. Depending on the type of charging system you have the batteries can either be left on the boat or they may have to be removed, which can be difficult because they are so heavy. Most larger boats have an onboard charging system, that when plugged into a power source, can maintain a fully charged battery, thus preventing it/them from freezing or breaking. If the batteries have to be removed it is important to store them somewhere inside to keep them warm.

Check to confirm the charger is still in operation and inspect the batteries for any cracks or leaks (If the batteries are left on board).
Re-install all of the batteries, making sure all of the connections are tight (If the batteries were removed and charged elsewhere).

, If your boat is equipped with an outdrive, trim-tabs, or both, your boat has at least one hydraulic system. These systems are typically very reliable year after year, but occasionally an O-ring or rubber seal could fail, causing hydraulic fluid to leak. It is better to know if something is malfunctioning on the outside of the boat before it goes in the water!

Operate either the boats outdrive or trim-tabs with someone standing outside at the back of the boat to make sure they are operating properly.







, A boat typically has a ½ inch screwed plug that screws into the hull from the outside. This plug is usually left out when out of the water (during the winter) to allow any accumulating water to run out.

Re-install the drain plug.
Tighten securely with a wrench.







, Most of the time larger boats have some type of fresh water system (a sink, ice maker, or toilet). These systems would have had to be winterized to prevent freezing. The process of winterizing can be different for every boat based on how complex the boats water system is. Sometimes the water lines or sections are disconnected to allow water to drain out.

If any hose or fittings had been disconnected during the winterization process, reconnect these sections.
Tighten securely with the proper tool.







, Built-in electronics are becoming more and more common in newer boat models (radars, GPS, etc.) However, older boat models normally had separate devices mounted on or around the driver’s helm station. Typically, these devices were removed from the boat during the winter months to prevent possible damage or potential theft.

Re-install these devices (if removed).

, All boats are required to carry certain distress signals including, flairs, fire extinguishers, life jackets, an anchor and anchor lines for the safety of everyone on board. For each distress signal there are different requirements so it is important to make sure all safety equipment is up to code and then you should be good to go!

Check flairs for expiration dates (if expired, purchase new ones).
Check the fire extinguisher (purchase a new one if it is discharged).
Provide life jackets for everyone on board.

Consider your specific needs.,
Know your adaptor options.,
Use an FM Transmitter to play music through your FM radio.,
Use a cassette tape adaptor for a cassette deck.,
Use a CD adaptor just like a cassette tape adaptor.,
Use an auxiliary or USB cord to connect any compatible media to your stereo.,
Purchase the appropriate adaptor.,
Plug in the adaptor.",How to Update a Toyota Corolla Car Radio2," Do you need the ability to play CDs? Do you want to hook up an MP3 player? The type of media that you wish to play will be crucial in helping you decide the best kind of adaptor to buy., There are several types of accessories and adaptors available to allow you to listen to a more varied media collection.The most popular are:

, This is likely the most universal adaptor since most cars are equipped with FM radios. The transmitter identifies an FM frequency that is not being used (at least near your) and casts music from your device over that frequency. The car radio can then pick up the waves and play the music just like any other radio station.The downside is that they are prone to interference.If you choose to use the FM transmitter, you will have to set your radio to the same station the the adaptor is transmitting rather than plugging it into the radio directly.
Though models vary depending on your accessories package, Corollas before 1999 may only have an FM stereo., If you want to avoid the interference of random FM waves but have a very old sound system with only a tape deck, a cassette tape adapter will be your best friend. These adaptors are made to fit into a cassette player on one end and plug into another device at the other end. The music from your device can then be played straight through your tape deck as if it were a cassette.From 1999 to 2009 the base model Corolla was equipped with a cassette deck., Like the cassette adaptor, the CD adaptor is made to go into a CD player and allow you to play non-CD media. This also avoids the interference of FM waves. You will usually have a need for this if your car’s sound system was built after cassettes when out of style and before MP3 players were popular.


In 2009, the base model Corolla was upgraded to a CD player., If you have a place to plug in other media, you only need an auxiliary cord or USB cord that fits your stereo and your media device. These cords became popular when car stereos were not equipped to play media from all devices, but manufacturer’s wanted to provide options to their clientele. It is the most ideal adaptor if your stereo is equipped with an auxiliary (aux) port.Also starting in 2009, the base model Corolla was equipped with an auxiliary audio jack., All of these adaptors are readily available and fairly inexpensive. You can usually find them at any store that with an electronics section.

, You will need to plug the cord of the adaptor into your media device, whether it’s a CD player, MP3 player, or other device. Then, insert the adaptor into your radio. Once your media is plugged into your radio, sit back and listen.

Any toyota built from that point forward might be Entune capable. If you are unsure if your vehicle has this software capability or not, contact your dealer or Toyota customer service.

, Unfortunately, your Toyota isn’t yet connected to wifi. You will need a way to transfer the update file from a computer to the car., It is ideal to name the file the same way that Toyota names it. “FAT32” is the name Toyota uses when they send out the Entune update files., Start your car, but keep it in park. Also, do this in a well ventilated area. It is dangerous to leave a car running in a closed space.

, If your car does not have a USB port, it is not likely Entune capable., When your system recognizes the Entune update file, it will ask you to confirm the update., Do not turn off the car or drive until the update is complete. Once it displays on the screen that the update is complete, you can remove the flashdrive and turn off or drive the car."

Turn up the music.",How to Wire Subwoofers," There are two ways to connect your wires, and it matters which way you choose. You will want to wire in series whenever you would like to raise the impedance of your system and wire in parallel whenever you would like to lower the impedance of your system.


Wiring in series means that you start by connecting the positive output terminal of your amp to the positive wire on speaker A. Then you connect the negative wire of speaker A to the positive wire of speaker B. Finally, the circuit is complete when you connect the negative wire of speaker B to the negative output terminal of your amp. This can be done for any number of speakers, so long as you follow the pattern (amp+ +speaker- +speaker- +speaker- +speaker- ……… +speaker- -amp).Wiring in parallel means that you will connect the positive output terminal of your amp to the positive wire of all speakers in your system. Then you would connect the negative output terminal of your amp to the negative wire of all speakers.;
, These two wiring schemes have dramatically different effects on the impedance and power output in your system.


Wiring in series increases the impedance of your system. This decreases the amount of power received by each speaker. Each speaker added will also raise the impedance of the system.Wiring in parallel decreases the impedance of your system. This means more power will go to each speaker because adding speakers to the circuit will lower the impedance of the system., The stereo head serves as the control panel for the system and sends signals to the amp. The amplifier, or amp, magnifies the signal from the stereo head and sends it to the speakers, which produce sound. The sub-woofers are the speakers responsible for producing sounds at a very low frequency., Your amp should have a label near the speaker output jack that indicates the output power (measured in Watts) and the minimum impedance (measured in Ohms). Your sub-woofers should also be labeled with an impedance value (in Ohms) and a value indicating the maximum power input that they can handle (in Watts)., You should have at least four different values written down.


Amp Output Power
Amp Minimum Impedance
Speaker Power Rating
Speaker Impedance

, To do this you should add together the speaker impedance number for all of your speakers. You want the impedance to be at least equal to the minimum impedance value of your amp on each channel, but not to exceed 16 Ohms unless your amp is specifically rated for impedance values above 16 Ohms.The formula for finding total impedance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 …. = Ztotal. Where Z is the impedance of a given speaker.
For example, if you have three speakers with impedance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total impedance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18).
The formula for finding total impedance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3…) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3…) =Ztotal.
So say you have two speakers with impedances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total impedance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded)
You can also use an impedance calculator such as this one http://www.speakerimpedance.co.uk/.

, This will be based upon the total impedance and the power output of your amplifier. You can use variations of Ohm’s Law to do the calculations yourselfor you can refer to the online calculator above.

, You do not want the system to have live power while you are making your connections. Turn the vehicle off and remove the cables from your battery.

, Connect the positive output wire to the positive wire of your first speaker. This may mean splicing the two wires together, but more often the amp is made to have the wire of the speaker inserted into an output jack. This step will be the same regardless of whether you are wiring in series or parallel. , Each of the speakers that you are wiring in series will be connected to each other. This can be done by splicing the wires together. Each of the speakers that you are wiring in parallel will be connected to the output jack on the amp. You can wire some speakers in series and some in parallel within the same system to reach the desired impedance/power values., This will be done by making the final connection and creating a “loop.” Connect the negative wire of the last speaker in any series, and the negative wires of all speakers in parallel, to the negative port of the output jack on the amp., Now you can connect the ground cable on your battery and restore power to the vehicle.

, This step is what it’s all about. Enjoy your music, and make sure that everyone else does to!

Reinstall the trim.",How to Wire a Car Stereo," Your new stereo will come with a diagram indicating what each wire is and what it needs to be connected to, but that process can be made much simpler by using a wiring harness clip adaptor. These adaptors are made to make it easy to connect your new stereo to the car’s existing clip. Use the diagram provided with the stereo as well as the diagram provided with the clip, to loosely connect each of the wires to the new adaptor.You can order adaptors online or at most auto parts or electronics stores.
Using the adaptor greatly reduces the chances that you will make a mistake wiring in your new stereo.;
, If you are not using a wiring harness clip adaptor, you will need to identify the wires coming out of the stereo, as well as those coming out of the car. Without an adaptor, you will need to cut the wires on the back of the car’s harness clip, but do so one at a time as you connect them to their corresponding wire on the stereo to prevent confusion. Use the repair manual for your car or locate a wiring diagram for your car online to aid in your efforts to identify each wire. Most car stereos will require the following connections:The power wire coming from the stereo is usually red, and likely will connect to a red wire from the car.
The ground wire for the stereo will be black, as will its corresponding wire from the car. If there is no ground wire, you can secure the ground cable to bare metal in the body of the car to serve as a ground.
The 12 volt constant power wire is usually yellow or blue, though it may be a number of colors coming from the car.
The rest of the harness wires are for the speakers. Use the diagrams to properly match each with its appropriate wire from the car.
The antenna wire is much thicker with a metal head and can be connected separately before you install the stereo. These wires are usually short and won’t be reconnected until you are about to install the new stereo.

, Some vehicles will require an output converter to make it work properly with components of the car that are not common industry wide. Some automakers use external amplifiers the stereo’s signal will need to compensate for. Your stereo may have come with an output convertor, but it’s more likely that you will need to order it from an auto parts or electronics store. Be sure you order an output converter designed specifically for your year, make and model vehicle.If you are unsure if your vehicle utilizes external amplifiers, refer to the owner’s manual.

, Once all of the wiring has been connected to their corresponding wires, you will need to make those connections permanent. There are a number of ways you can permanently bond two wires together and while some may be more resilient than others, most will work just fine for car stereo applications. Be sure there is no bare wire metal showing from any of the wire connections by wrapping them in electric tape or heat-shrink wrap.Soldering two wires together requires a soldering iron and solder. You melt the solder onto the wires to stick them together and as the solder cools it forms a permanent bond.
Twisting wires together and then covering them with heat-shrink wrap or electric tape will suffice for car stereos.
Connectors can be purchased that you simply slide both wires into and either crimp them together with pliers or twist them together with your fingers.

, Because you will be working on the electrical system of your car, it’s important to disconnect the battery before you get started. If you aren’t sure where to locate the battery in your vehicle, refer to your owner’s manual; most car batteries can be found under the hood, but some are kept in the trunk. Once you locate the battery, use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the black cable from the negative terminal on the battery. You will not need to remove the bolt entirely, instead simply loosen it enough to pull the cable off of the terminal. Tuck the cable down to the side of the battery so that it can’t come back into contact with the terminal.You do not need to remove the battery or disconnect the cable from the positive terminal.
To be sure the battery is disconnected, check to see if the lights come on in the cabin of the car. Nothing electronic should work with the battery disconnected.
Disconnecting the battery will prevent you from doing damage to the electrical system as well as protect you from shocks.

, You will need to gain access to the sides of the stock head unit (or stereo) in your center console. In some cars, that will require the removal of some pieces of plastic trim. Be careful when removing trim pieces, as they may be brittle and subject to cracking. Whenever possible, try to pull the piece of trim out slightly to get a look at what kind of clip is used to attach it. You may need to slide the trim piece in a certain direction to separate it, you may need to hit a release with a screw driver, or you may need to simply pull on it hard enough. Checking first will prevent you from breaking off the clips and having to replace the piece of trim.Consult your car’s repair manual if you want to determine the best way to remove pieces of trim that are in your way.
Set the trim aside where you won’t accidentally sit or step on it as you work.

, Car stereos are all held in place using one of two methods: spring clips or bolts. Each method requires a different technique for removal. In order to determine what method your car uses to secure the stereo, you can consult your car’s repair manual or look closely once you’ve gotten the trim out of the way. Spring clip mounts may not require the removal of any trim pieces and can be identified by the matching pairs of holes on either side of the stereo. Stereos that are bolted into place may require more trim removal, as you will need to gain access to the space behind the stereo.Look for two pairs of matching holes on the left and ride side of the stereo. If they are present, your stereo is held in place with spring clips.
If there are no holes, remove the trim below, above or to the side of the stereo to gain access to the bolts.

, If your stereo or head unit is held in place using spring clips, you will need to purchase a pair of DIN tools. DIN tools look like thin pieces of metal bent into the shape of the letter “U” with slightly hooked ends. Insert one DIN tool into the two holes on the left, and another into the two holes on the right. Press them both in until you hear the click of the spring releasing. Spread the tools apart slightly to grip the back of the stereo and pull the tools toward yourself. The stereo will slide out of the console of the car along with the tools.In a bind, you may be able to use pieces of a metal coat hanger to create your own DIN tools.
If the stereo doesn’t come out, it is likely stuck by a piece of trim. Don’t force it out, instead look for any obstructions that may be preventing it from moving.

, You will likely need to remove quite a bit more of the trim to access bolts that hold your stereo in place than you would have with spring clipped stereos. Once you are able to see the bolts, removing the stereo should be fairly self-explanatory: there will likely be four bolts, either attaching the stereo to a bracket at the back or on either side. Determine the size of the bolts, then use a hand wrench to remove them. Some brackets won’t require that you remove the bolts completely, but may just need you to loosen them sufficiently to slide the stereo out.There may be a trim “faceplate” over the stereo that pops off, revealing bolts in the face of the stereo instead of behind it. Unscrew these bolts and slide the stereo out.
Remember that the stereo is still connected to the car with wires, so be careful not to rip any out as you remove the stereo from the console.

, If you are removing a stock head unit, there will likely be at least one plastic clip with a number of wires going into it that you will need to disconnect. There may be a second clip and an antennae cable as well in some cars. These few clips consolidate all the wiring required to connect the stereo to the car’s power source, the antennae and each of the speakers. If you are removing an aftermarket stereo, there is a possibility that there will be no clip and the previous stereo was wired loosely. If that is the case, you may have to cut the wires in order to connect them to the new head unit.Do not pull the wires out of the clip. If you are able to purchase a harness adaptor for your new stereo, it will plug directly into the car’s existing clip.
Be careful when removing the wire harness clip from the back of the stereo. It may have a plastic button or tab holding it in place.

, Before you install the stereo in the center console of your vehicle, reconnect the battery and turn the car on to make sure it is functioning properly. With the stereo completely connected, turn it on and try a few functions. Make sure all speakers in your vehicle are working and that CDs or your MP3 player play properly. If you have been able to connect the antennae cable already, check to make sure the radio works.


Checking the stereo’s functions now will prevent you from having to take the console apart again to address any issues with the wiring.
If something does not work properly, review the connections with the wiring diagrams that you have to make sure all of the wires are connected to their corresponding match.
Remove the keys and disconnect the battery again after you’ve tested the stereo.

, You may have noticed that most of the wires you connected to your stereo allowed for quite a bit of slack. Take the connected car stereo in one hand and use the other to tuck all of the extra wire back into the dashboard as you set the stereo in its opening. If you have not been able to connect the large antennae cable yet because it was too short, connect it now as you sit the stereo in its place.Be careful not to pull any wires out of the back of the stereo as you tuck them back into the dash board.
Try not to let the wiring get in the way of the bracket you will need to bolt the stereo too (if your stereo requires being bolted into place).

, Slowly slide the radio back into the opening in the center console of the vehicle while being careful not to apply too much pressure to the face of it. If you encounter resistance, do not force the stereo in any further. Instead remove the stereo and identify what was in the way, move it, and attempt to slide the stereo in again. As you slide the stereo into place, wires may snag or plastic brackets may come out of place. Forcing the stereo past a snag can break things and make the stereo fail to function or seat properly in the vehicle.Some vehicles may require an adaptor to properly fit the new stereo in the hole for the old one. These adaptors can be ordered at auto parts and electronics stores.

, If your stereo utilizes spring clips, it will click as it locks in place and you will not need to take any further action to secure the stereo. If yours uses bolts and brackets, reuse the bolts you removed earlier to secure the new stereo in the same place. If you had to use an adaptor to properly fit the stereo in its space in the console, ensure the stereo is secured to the adaptor and that the adaptor is secured to the car.If you use bolts, make sure they are snugly tightened before reinstalling the trim.
Once done, try to wiggle the stereo. It should hardly move at all when properly secured.

, Being careful not to break any of the plastic clips that hold the trim in place, reinstall each piece in the opposite order you removed them. That means you should install the last piece you removed first, followed by the second to last, and so on. This will make sure overlapping pieces are layered properly.If you break a clip and the trim won’t stay in place, you can use a hot glue gun to secure trim pieces to your car, but be aware that it will make it more difficult to remove those pieces again in the future.
If you break an entire trim piece, you will likely need to special order a replacement from the dealership, as most auto parts stores don’t carry trim components.

, Match the colors on the harnesses or follow the included diagram. This makes it much easier to install and later remove the head-unit should you decide to take it to another car, and a wiring harness adapter usually only costs around $20 or less.You may also need to purchase an antenna adaptor for your new head unit and vehicle., You will need a service manual such as Haynes, but any manual that provides details for your make and model should work. Every stereo is different, and sometimes it is required that you remove parts of the dash/console to remove the stereo. This is where the manual will be most helpful.It can also be helpful to have a comprehensive guide on aftermarket stereo installation.

, This will cut power to the car and allow you to safely work on the electrical components (like stereo wiring).

, This will usually consist of taking off some portion of the dash and or faceplate (consult your service manual) and then taking out the mounting screws that hold in your head unit. Once you’ve done this, the unit will slide right out., It will be plugged into the back of your head unit. You will have access to it when you pull the head unit out. Some people choose to cut these wires away (especially if they didn’t purchase a wiring adaptor) but this can void the warranty., The wires will be clearly marked, as the adaptor is designed to make your car and head unit fit together. Crimp the wires as instructed in the wiring harness adapter's instructions. After crimping (or soldering as some choose to do), twist on appropriate sized wire nuts and make sure to keep your wires as neat as possible., This part is even easier than connecting the adaptor to the head unit. It literally is designed to plug right into your factory wiring harness. Do that now., If you needed an antenna adaptor, you can plug it into the back of the head unit and plug the antenna lead into the adaptor. Otherwise, your antenna should plug directly into the back of the head unit., The size of your original and aftermarket head units may be different. They typically come in one of three sizes - Single DIN, DIN and a half, Double DIN. If your aftermarket head unit is a different size than the original, you may need an adaptor, or DIN cage, to mount it.If they are the same size, the aftermarket stereo should bolt into the original mounting brackets for the head unit., This is where your service manual will come in handy again. Now you need to put back together any pieces of the dash that were removed to get the stereo out., This will restore power to your car, and by extension, your new head unit.

, Now you should be able to turn on your stereo and enjoy a crisp, clean sound.

This rating needs to match the load you put on your amp. A low quality or low power amp matched to high speakers would not take full advantage of the speakers quality. A too powerful amp will blow your speakers in a couple months., This can be done by disconnecting the battery ground cable. This will prevent injury or damage to your vehicle while working with wiring within the car.

, This is important to get right. You want the amp to be somewhere where it can safely disperse heat. Otherwise, it will burn up and potentially start a fire. If you have an open trunk space that is usually ideal. Sometimes, another alternative is to put the amp under or behind seats, but be sure there is enough room for the amp to vent.

, Using RCA cables is recommended for connecting the amp to the head unit, as they insulate the wire and dampen any distortion of the signal. It is also recommended that the cables be run on the side of the car opposite of the amp’s power wire to avoid signal interruptions that negatively  impact sound quality., The amp should be connected to a switched power supply. This way, power is only provided when the car is turned on. The power wire (also known as the remote turn on wire) will sometimes plug directly into your head unit. If not you will need to connect it to a switched power supply such as the head unit power supply or the ignition switch., You will need to connect the amp’s ground wire to another grounded wire or to any grounding point on the car. Grounding points are bare (clean, unpainted) metal surfaces. Be sure to do this somewhere that no one will incidentally touch it., There purpose of the amplifier is, after all, to amplify the signal coming from the head unit to fully utilize the speakers. You may have to cut the speaker wires from a spool of wire and strip enough insulation off of the end to fit into the amp’s terminals. Each wire should then be run to its corresponding speaker and connected to the speaker’s positive terminal., For all speakers wired in series, connect only the last speaker’s negative wire to the amp’s negative terminal. For all speakers wired in parallel, connect the negative wire of each speaker to the amp’s negative terminal."

Match your speakers to your amplifier.,
Purchase the best quality speakers in your budget.,
Find a home for your speakers.,
Wire the speakers to the amp.",How to Upgrade Your Car's Sound System3," The amplifier has a specific power rating and impedance rating. The speaker load needs to fit within these ratings or you will blow your speakers and/or burn up your amp. You need to understand the basics of wiring speakers before your start the job., No matter how much you are spending on an amp or a head unit, if you have low quality speakers, you will get low quality sound. Speakers come from 1"" tweeters to 15""+ subwoofers. Generally, a smaller speaker gives clearer highs and bigger speakers give deeper lows. Mid-range speakers come in 2 way (plays high and low) and 3 way (plays highs mid and lows)., Speaker placement is important to consider. The difference in distance between the listener and one speaker as opposed to the others will change the perceived sound. It is recommended that speakers go in the kick panel when possible.However, it is sometimes necessary to put them in other locations, such as the trunk, for space purposes.

, As described in the “Upgrading by Installing an Amp” section, you will need a spool of wire to run from the speakers to the amp (unless you are replacing a pre-existing speaker and the wire is already there). Your wiring will differ depending on whether you are wiring in series or in parallel."

Install the two speakers, one on each side of the front of your audience.,
Place your single cardioid microphone on its stand where you plan to place the person speaking but never in front of the speakers.,
Connect the microphone cable to your mixer/preamp at input one.,
Connect the preamplifier/mixer mono output to the mono input of your amplifier.,
Connect the output channels of your amplifier to the left and right speakers.,
Now that you're all connected, you can set levels.,
When you've got your proper settings on the preamplifier, slowly turn your amplifier volume controls up until a good listening volume is achieved.",How to Set Up a Simple One Microphone Sound System," Aim the speakers so that the left speaker covers the left side of the audience and the right side speaker covers the right side of the audience. This is for mono use. If you choose stereo, you'll need two sound sources such as a left and right channel of music. One microphone should always be hooked up mono.;
, When you place the microphone in front of the speakers, your chances of producing feedback (that squealing sound) are greatly enhanced. A microphone placed behind the sound system has a much better chance of rejecting feedback. The cardioid microphone is another name for a directional microphone. Its pick up pattern is directed away from the back of the mic and helps to reduce feedback as well. Another type of mic would be an omni which has a pickup pattern that's close to equal in front and in back of the mic. Not a good mic for preventing feedback in your system.

, You may have a ""line"" or ""mic"" switch above the volume knob or slider. Use the ""mic"" position. The ""line"" position is normally used for music sources such as a CD or Cassette player. If you have a gain control knob, sometimes called trim) above the slider or volume knob, set it at halfway for now. It's a good starting point to allow enough signal into this input and should keep you from ""overloading"" the input from too much signal. ( some united will have a red flashing light if signal is overloaded)

, If there is no mono input on your amplifier, you may use the left channel of the amp to drive both speakers (assuming you have enough power in the amp) or ""Y"" the Left and Right inputs to the amplifier. This means that the mono out of the preamp is ""Y"" connected to both left and right amplifier inputs. Set the amplifier volume controls to minimum until we get a good level coming out of your preamp.

, Keep cables neat and taped down. They are easy to trip on and cause injury to someone.

, Take the mic and talk normally into it. Watch the meter on the preamplifier as you raise the slider (or volume knob)up slowly. Have your master control set at 3/4 or ""7"" as a good place to begin. Raise the input one control until you reach the maximum allowable setting on your meter. this would be ""0"" on a needle meter (VU Meter) or to the yellow light on an LED meter. If you get into the red, lower your gain setting on the ""input gain"" knob. Your ideal setting should be with your input one slider or knob at 3/4 or ""7"" for correct mixing board operation. Never run your input way down low and your master way up high. This will only overload your console and give you distorted sound. Your meters should ""Peak"" at 1 or 2 or just when the first red LED lights up. When you go higher, your asking for distortion or that ""fuzzy"" sound in the speakers.

, If your mic goes into feedback, lower the volume or move the mic further away from the speakers.

, Pick something that you play often in your car, so you know what to listen for. This will help you spot anything that sounds unusual. You could also pick a song that has a clear and familiar bass line.

, If the audio is too low, it will be hard to tell if you have a blown speaker. This doesn't mean that you should blast your whole neighborhood with your tunes to diagnose your vehicle.


Adjust the treble and bass, if necessary. Make sure that their levels are equal in the twelve o'clock position. When you hear a lack of range, it might just mean your system isn't equalized properly., If you have trouble recognizing distortion, play a track on headphones or on another device. Then, play that same track through your car's sound system. If you hear crackles or the song sounds slightly muffled, one or more of your speakers might be blown.


Listen for rattling. If the speaker is blown, you will likely hear a shaking, rattling sound., If a certain bass, mid, or high speaker is blown, you will notice certain registers don't come through. This is easiest if you are familiar with the song, and know what to listen for or expect., If possible, use your audio system's fader controls to attempt to isolate the faulty speaker. By narrowing down one section of the car, you'll have a better chance of determining which speaker is blown. Always try to isolate the problem so you don't overspend and replace the entire system.Use the pan function to switch the sound from left to right. When panning, go 100% to either the left or right side to fully isolate it.
Use the fade settings the same as the pan setting. Go 100% to the rear or front of your car.

, Listen out for a brief popping sound form the speaker.This might require you to unscrew the speaker out of its holder.
Only remove the wires if you're comfortable handling electronics.

, Remove the speaker cover so you can inspect the speaker itself. Attach the wires to a 9-volt battery again and observe the speaker. If the cone moves, your problem is in the connection, not the speaker., These simple electronic tools help measure ohms and voltages. They can be found at your local electronic store or hardware store.


You can also use an ohmmeter.

, Set your device to reading ohms if you're using a multimeter. Make sure that the speakers are turned off. Touch the lead of your device to each terminal of the speaker. The terminal is the part of the speaker where the wires attach.If you get a reading of 1.0 ohms, then that speaker is not blown and the problem is somewhere else.
If the device reads infinite ohms, then your speaker is blown., If there is something wrong with the amplifier, you will likely hear some sound distortion when you turn on your speakers, or nothing at all. This is usually because there is something wrong with the fuse or the capacitor.

, If you don't know where the fuse box is, you can check online or in the manual that came with your car, as each car will be a little different. A fuse box will usually be located in the front of the knee-well or under the dashboard, however., This will help you figure out whether or not the fuse is good or needs

, Touch the multimeter's red wire to one of the poles on the fuse. Touch the meter's black wire to the other pole.

, If you hear a beep, then the fuse is good, and your problem is likely with the capacitor. If you don't hear a beep, then the fuse is blown and needs to be replaced. Be sure to get the exact same fuse model.


If you hear a beep, consider replacing the amp first. They are usually less expensive, and don't require soldering irons and desoldering pumps like new capacitors do.

, They should be working now. If they don't, then there might be something else wrong with your car's speakers. Consider taking your car in to the repair shop, and having a professional take a look at it.

, Visually take a look at the speaker once you've determined the speaker is faulty. Look for holes, tears, or splits on the speaker. Make sure the cover of the speaker is off so you can truly inspect it. Most damage that you'll be able to see will be on the cone of the speaker, or the soft part.


Gently run your hand along the cone to make sure there isn't any scrapes you can't see.
Dust or dirt shouldn't effect the quality of the speaker, but it might be a good idea to clean them out.

, If you only have a small tear, you can fix the damages with a sealer designed for speakers. If the damage is overwhelming, you'll probably need to replace the speaker.

, Once you've determined one of your speakers is blown, you'll want to see if any of the other speakers are blown. Remove the faulty speaker, if you haven't already done so. Play a track in your car and listen for speaker irregularities.


If the problem persists in multiple speakers, consider replacing the entire system.
Follow the above steps to test any other suspicious speakers.

, Take your car or speaker to an automotive audio specialist. Explain the tests you gave and ask them what their estimate would be to inspect and repair the speaker or speakers. Be frank and ask if she thinks it'll be more price effective to replace the set.

Set the volume to zero on your car stereo.,
Turn the gain on your amplifier all the way down.,
Power up your stereo and either play a CD or a radio station.,
Turn the stereo up to 2/3 the max volume.,
Twist the gain dial on your amplifier.,
Adjust your volume to a normal level.",How to Set the Gain on a Car Amplifier1," You want to be sure that you are starting with no sound distortions.;
, The amplifier is usually an aftermarket part that is installed trunk of a car or the rear of a truck. There will be a knob that labeled ""gain."" Turning down the gain means that the amplifier is not amplifying the signal coming in from the stereo head (the part mounted to your dash).

, You will not be able to hear anything yet, since your volume is set to zero.

, This is the best range to use when setting gain because you avoid overworking the stereo head. If you overwork the stereo head you could end up sending distorted sounds to your amplifier. Digital displays make it easy to tell when you are at 2/3 volume, but if you do not have one you can turn the volume all the way up (counting the number of turns) and then turn it back 1/3 of the way. For example, if you turn the volume knob 3 times to get to max volume, you would turn it back down 1 full turn to get to 2/3 volume.

, Turn it up (clockwise) until the sound (music, talking, test tone, etc.) is as loud as you might ever want to listen to it, so long as you do not hear any sound distortion or overload your speakers. If you do hear a distortion, turn the gain back down until the distortion is gone. Some amplifiers will have a knob that can be turned by hand, but others may require the use of a screwdriver to adjust the gain.

, Now that your gain is set, you can go back to the driver’s seat and enjoy the music.

Enjoy music.",How to Set the Gain on a Car Amplifier2," You will need to use a variation of Ohm’s Law, v=√(P∙R), to calculate your target voltage. To see the math behind this you can look at an electrical engineering formula wheel. If you do not want to do the math, you can use an online converter to plug in the wattage of your amplifier and the resistance of your speakers to get your target output voltage., This can dramatically change the voltage reading you get and is worth knowing.


Speakers wired in series are all connected in a chain and increase the resistance of your system. This decreases the amount of power received by each speaker. Each speaker added will also raise the resistance of the system.The formula for finding total resistance for speakers wired in series is Z1 + Z2 + Z3 …. = Ztotal. Where Z is the resistance of a given speaker.
For example, if you have three speakers with resistance values of 4 Ohms, 6 Ohms, and 8 Ohms your total resistance wired in series would be 18 Ohms (4+6+8=18).
Speakers wired in parallel are all connected to the amp directly. This decreases the resistance of your system. This means more power will go to each speaker because adding speakers to the circuit will lower the resistance of the system. Do not decrease resistance too much or you will damage your amp. The formula for finding total resistance of speakers wired in parallel is a little trickier. It is (Z1 x Z2 x Z3… ) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3…) =Ztotal.
So say you have two speakers with resistances of 6 Ohms and 8 Ohms. This time it would look like this: 1) Multiply the values. 6 x 8 = 48 Ohms 2) Add the values. 6 + 8 = 14 Ohms 3) Divide the top by the bottom to find your total resistance. 48/14 = 3.43 Ohms (rounded)

, You will need to create a tone that will allow you to test your system. This can be done using a program such as audacity, or downloading the appropriate tone from the internet. You should use a sine wave that is 50-60 Hz to test a woofer or subwoofer amplifier and use a sine wave that is in the range of 1,000 Hz to test a mid-range amplifier., You will need to play this tone through your car’s stereo system, so it will need to be put on a CD or MP3 player.

, Any speakers, additional amplifiers, etc. should be unplugged from the back of the amplifier you are testing. This should leave only the stereo head (the piece mounted in your dash) and the amplifier hooked up.

, You amplifier has the ability to filter out certain bandwidths of sound. To set the gain you want the maximum range of bandwidth, so you should turn the equalizer settings off or set them to zero. This prevents the filtering of any sound waves.

, This usually means turning the dial counter-clockwise as far as it will go., If your multi-meter has multiple settings for A/C volts, make sure you choose the range in which your target voltage resides.

, Put in the CD or connect the MP3 player that holds your test tone. Turn the stereo on. Remember that the volume and gain are set to zero, so you will not hear your test tone yet.

, This will prevent the stereo head from sending distorted sounds to the amplifier, and allow you to adjust your amplifier to a crisp clean sound.

, This will allow you to measure the voltage coming out of the amplifier.

, Turn the gain dial clockwise until your multi-meter reads your target voltage. Once you reach the target voltage, the gain is set on your amplifier.

, You no longer need the test tone. You can save it for another time.

, Anything that you removed prior to setting your gain (speakers, amplifiers, etc.) should be plugged back in.

, This is why you purchased your amplifier in the first place right? Now you can enjoy it!

Grab a blank or useless CD.,
Place the second CD about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the slot.,
Press the 'Eject' button and gently wiggle the CD around.,
Apply pressure to the unit.",How to Remove a Stuck CD from a Car CD Player2," This method involves inserting a second CD into the player, so, to prevent damage to a beloved album, try to procure a blank CD or one that you otherwise don't care about.


Turn the CD player on before proceeding. If this requires you to start the car, then start the car and turn the CD player on.

Note: This method, like several others in this article, carries the risk of damage to the stuck CD or the player itself. Use caution when inserting any foreign objects into your CD player. If you're ever worried about damaging your CD player, stop and take your problem to a professional.

, Your CD should be above the stuck CD. With luck, you'll be able to feel the stuck CD slide beneath the one in your hand.

, By doing this, you are attempting to give the stuck CD traction against the mechanism that the player uses to eject it.If you feel the stuck CD start to eject, to care to ensure that it doesn't become sandwiched between the second CD and the edge of the CD slot.


If this doesn't work, repeat, but try to get the blank CD below the the jammed CD, then gently pry it upwards. CD players can differ in their precise ejection mechanism, so sometimes upward pressure can be more successful in giving the ejection mechanism traction on a stuck CD than downward pressure.

, Sometimes, applying pressure to the unit itself can help the stuck CD gain traction. If the player is mounted in such a way that it's near the upper surface of the dashboard, you may have success repeating the steps in this method while pressing or gently but firmly smacking the area of the dashboard above the player.



Note that, while some have had success by banging on the dash, this can damage delicate components of the center console, so it is not recommended if your car has a GPS, etc. between the CD player and the top surface of the dashboard.

Wait 10 seconds, then reconnect the terminal.,
If the CD player still won't turn on, replace its fuse.",How to Remove a Stuck CD from a Car CD Player3," This method is useful when you can't remove a CD because your CD player will no longer turn on. This method involves disconnecting, then reconnecting the electrical supply to the CD player. For most CD players, this means that any radio presets you've set will be erased and your personal audio settings will be reset to their defaults. If you're an avid listener of music in your car, make sure you record your personal settings so they can easily be restored afterward.

, When manipulating or altering your car's electrical system, it's important to ensure you're not in danger of electrocution. Turn the car off and remove the keys from the ignition, then open the hood for access to the battery.

, The negative terminal on a car's battery is colored black, while the positive terminal is colored red. Carefully disconnect the negative terminal. Some terminals may require you to use a small wrench or pliers to loosen a nut before removing the wire connection.

, After reconnecting the terminal, tun the car on and try to eject the CD as normal. Disconnecting then reconnecting the CD player's power supply can cause the CD player to ""reset"" to its factory default, which, in some cases, can restore its ejection functionality.

, Check your owner's manual - often, a car's fuse box will be behind a panel somewhere on the driver's side of the dashboard. Disconnect the battery, remove the fuse box's protective covering, then, consulting your owner's manual, replace any of your CD player's fuses that may have blown.

Reduce electrocution risk.,
Wrap tape (sticky side out) around the end of a putty knife (or similar object).,
Stick a thin piece of paper on one side of the knife.,
Insert the knife into CD player, sticky side down.",How to Remove a Stuck CD from a Car CD Player4," In this method, you insert a long, flat knife or similar object directly into the CD player. Knives made from metal conduct electricity, so, if you have an object made from wood or plastic that will work (like, for instance, a popsicle stick), use it. If not, be sure to disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and the CD player off and disconnect the negative terminal of your car's battery.



Note: As with other methods described in this article, this method carries the risk of damage to the stuck CD or the CD player itself. If you don't want to put your property at risk, take your car to a trained automotive professional.

, Use a strong tape like Gorilla tape for best results. Putty knives are typically tapered so that if you wrap the tape tight enough, it will not slide off the end. If you're using another object, like a popsicle stick, which doesn't taper, you may need to stick the tape to the object, wrap it around several times, then put a twist in the tape and wrap it around several more times to make sure the tape is adequately secured to the object.

, Because your knife (or stick, etc.) is now covered with sticky tape, it can be difficult to insert it into the CD player. To make this process easier, use paper to make one side of your knife smooth. Stick a small piece of printer or construction paper onto your knife. Trim the paper with scissors so that it matches the size and shape of the knife.

, Delicately wiggle your knife to feel for the top of the CD. Press down gently to get the tape to stick to the CD. When you feel that your knife is stuck to the CD, gently try to lift and remove the CD.

With the card inserted, slide the screwdriver above the card.,
Remove the screwdriver, then slowly pull the card out.",How to Remove a Stuck CD from a Car CD Player5," As above, disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and CD player off and disconnect the battery's negative terminal.



Note: If done improperly, this method may scratch or otherwise damage your CD and/or CD player. As always, use caution, and, if you're ever in doubt, contact an auto repair expert.

, For this method, you want a card that's thin but sturdy. Use an expired credit card or a similar object - preferably, one that's not important, in case you lose it or it breaks. Stick double-sided scotch tape on one side of the card, near the edge of one of the two narrow ends.


Alternatively, you can use single-sided tape, sticking the tape to the card, putting a twist in it, then wrapping it around the card several times.

, This method, though similar to the putty knife method above, differs in that it uses a screwdriver to assist with sticking the card to the CD. You'll want a fairly short, thin flat head screwdriver. Use a screwdriver that's as thin as possible, as you'll need to partially insert it into the CD slot.

, You may need to use the screwdriver to guide the card, ensuring it goes in above the CD and does not stick to the CD until after you get 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) of the card in.

, Use the screwdriver to gently press down on the card. This should cause the tape on the bottom side of the card to stick to the top side of the stuck CD.

, With luck, the CD should come with the card. If not, try repeating the previous steps.

There are 4 main types of speakers in your car.,
Adding tweeters to your current system would give the biggest improvement in your front sound stage.,
High-mids front speakers, usually in your doors, provide the majority of the music you hear.,
Mid-Low rear speakers are mostly there only for rear fill.,
Low Subwoofer bass- A topic one in itself.,
Amps - amps are only necessary when you think your sound level (volume) is too low even at max.",How to Upgrade Your Vehicle's Audio System," You have your high-pushing tweeters, your high-mid fronts, mid-low rears, and low subwoofers.;
, This will pretty much make it feel like the artist is actually in front of you singing. Tweeters only handle a certain range of frequencies, eliminating bass, mids and lows, and providing clear, crisp highs. Tweeters go in your dash to provide a forward sound stage.

, They will cover vocals, especially the little bit of bass that vocals needs to sound realistic. They will also cover most of the music you will hear. These should be the highest quality speakers you can buy. Prices range from 30-150 USD for a pair.

, These will greatly improve the sound quality in your rear seat, but not as much since your sound stage will want to be pushed forward.

, Subs come in a big range and variety. They can be as small as 8"" and as large as 15"" or more. The differences can be very dramatic based on your car. a 15"" subwoofer with the biggest amp money can buy will sound like garbage in a small civic trunk. A dual sub setup may not be the best solution if you are limited on space. ( A little math, a 15"" subwoofer has a surface area of 176"" while a 10"" subwoofer has 78.5"". So a larger subwoofer will greatly increase your surface area (15"" has more than 2 10""), therefore increase the amount of air a sub can push, and increase bass.

, A simple 2 channel wired to your front speakers will improve your sound the most. A fatter wallet will purchase a 4 channel and wire the rear speakers as well. A subwoofer will not work without an amp.

Play music while driving using a cassette adapter if your car stereo accepts cassette tapes.",How to Play Digital Music Files in Your Car1," Here are the steps that you need to follow.


Insert the cassette adapter into your car's cassette player.
Plug in the wire from the cassette adapter into the headphone jack on your external device that can play digital music.
Select and play the songs that you want to listen to. The songs in digital format will be streamed from your music player to your car speakers through the cassette adapter.;
"
"
Connect your digital music player to your car's stereo using an audio cable if your stereo has any audio line in ports available.",How to Play Digital Music Files in Your Car2,"


Look for a line in port on your car stereo. It is usually marked as ""Line In"" or ""Input.""
Purchase an audio cable that can connect the headphone jack on your digital music player to the line in port on your car's stereo. The type of wire you need to get depends on the specifications of the headphone jack and line in port (audio cable connectors are usually measured as 2.5mm or 3.5mm).
Set your car stereo to play the signal it is receiving from the line in port (this can be in the same way you change the setting to any other input signal such as CD, radio or cassette).
Hear the songs that you are playing on your digital music player through your car speakers. In summary, you have simply replaced your headphones by choosing your car speakers as the output device instead while using a very similar connection method.

"
"
Transmit songs in the form of FM signals from your digital music player to your car radio using an FM transmitter.",How to Play Digital Music Files in Your Car3," This device converts the song being played digitally into a song being broadcast on FM radio.


Plug the FM transmitter into the headphone jack of your digital music player.
Turn on the FM transmitter using its power button or switch.
Select the frequency that you want to broadcast your music on. The transmitter should have some preset frequencies that you can select from.
Tune your car radio to the same frequency that your FM transmitter will be transmitting songs on.
Play songs on your digital music player and hear them in your car just like you would listen to any other radio station.

If your car CD player can play digital formats such as MP3, WAV or WMA then you can try to burn your music onto an audio CD to play in your car.",How to Play Digital Music Files in Your Car4," You can use various programs for burning audio CD collections but the method to burn a CD is usually almost the same. Here is the method you would use on Nero Burning ROM that you can follow as a generic example.


Insert a blank writable CD into your CD writer tray.
Open the Nero Burning ROM software.
Select ""CD"" in the drop-down menu of the New Compilation window.
Go to the Burn tab and put a tick next the ""Write"" and ""Finalize CD.""
Browse to the audio files that you want to burn using the File Browser in the Nero Burning ROM program. Simply drag and drop the files that you want to burn from the File Browser to the list below.
Click the Burn button on the taskbar. Nero Burning ROM will show you a status bar while the files are being burnt onto the CD and let you know once the burning process is complete.
Play the burnt CD in your car just like you would play any other audio CD.

Go to the audio shop and buy some wiring adequate for the amperage of your audio amplifier.,
Disconnect the negative battery terminal before any wiring modifications to your vehicle.

,
Install the positive wire.,
Install the negative.,
Put in your RCA and REM.,
Hook up the solid blue REM wire.,
Hook up your amp with the provided instructions (Make sure your negative battery terminal is disconnected) and tell your radio to turn on the subs or just turn on the radio.,
Hook up the sub wires to the subs and amplifier with the car off.

,
Pray a lot, turn on the car and get ready to bump!",How to Install Sub Woofers," The wiring kit you get should include: large amounts of positive and ground wiring, battery terminal adapters, blue remote turn-on wire, RCA interconnect cable, speaker wire, fuse holder with fuses, connectors & wire ties.;
,, You need to run it from the battery to the amplifier. Since the wires are thick and there is no tool big enough to strip them, the best way is to use a straight edge razor blade. Make cuts on 4 sides down the wire then carefully connect the 4 slits with a slit in the middle all the way around the wire. Then the insulation will come off easily.


Make sure you install a fuse in the positive wire to prevent damage to the amp, your car, yourself and others, in case of an electrical fault.






After the fuse has been fitted, run the wire though the car to your amp. Since wires go to your trunk anyway (if that's where your amp is) find them with a repair manual and follow those with your new wires.







, Sometimes any bare metal works. but to be sure it's a good ground. Connect your positive and with a multimeter switch it to 12v dc and touch one end to the end of your positive and the other to your ground. If it reads 12v then it's ok. If it reads OL or 0, you'll need to find somewhere else for the ground.

, The RCA is the wire with two connectors on either end and they plug in to your head unit. They usually go to wires sticking out of the unit labeled sub out or output. the White is always negative. Run the RCA in the same place your negative is going to your amp

, This tells your amp to turn on. You will need to pull the radio and connect it to the wire label System Remote. You can find it in a wiring diagram for your radio or sometimes its blue with a white stripe or solid blue.

, If the power light come on on the amp then you did good. If your going to do this right you should secure the amp with screws. you can do this with a mounting bracket but this take time and fabrication and is not really necessary.

,, If it doesn't work, check your fuse on the positive wire. You did put a fuse in didn't you? If it blew you screwed up the wiring. go back and check it out!

"
"
Raise the hood on your vehicle and look to see which side your battery is located on.,
Look along the firewall and see if there is a good spot to run your power wire through.,
Take out your cordless power drill and steel drill bit.,
Protect the drilled hole with paint from rust.,
Place a rubber grommet into the hole so that it won't harm the wire.,
Run the power wire from the interior of the vehicle, through the hole, and to the battery area.,
Install an inline fuse.,
Pull back the carpet along the driver´s side so you can run the power wire.,
Continue to run your power wire to it's destination point (where the amp is mounted).,
Connect your power wire to the amplifier using the correct hardware (such as ring terminal).,
Use plastic zip ties to secure your power wire to make sure it doesn't move or interfere with surrounding wires.

,
Run the RCA cables and the remote turn-on wire (typically a blue wire but you will need to check your head unit's manual) from the back of your head unit to your amplifier's mounting location.,
Run your speaker wires from your speakers to your amplifier.,
Connect the speaker wires to your amplifier using the appropriate connectors.,
Connect the negative terminal of the amplifier to the chassis ground of your vehicle.,
Check over your work and make sure everything is secure.,
Reconnect the negative battery terminal and you´re done.

",How to Install Car Audio Amplifiers," Disconnect the negative battery terminal.;
, Some vehicles have places that have an empty rubber grommet that hides an unused factory hole. You can just put a hole in this grommet and run your wire through. If your vehicle does not have a factory hole in it, then you will have to make one.

, Check the area very carefully before you start drilling. You don't want to drill into anything unnecessarily. 

, Rust can cause damage to the firewall in the future.

, This is very important. High voltage will be traveling through this wire and if it were to chafe and touch the firewall, problems will occur.

, You must pay close attention during this process. Make sure you do not pinch the power wire or accidentally cut the power wire while you are running it through the engine bay.

, This should be installed as close to the battery as possible. This fuse will protect your vehicle from being destroyed in case of a power wiring shorting.

, You will need to remove the rocker panel and kick panel covers to do this as well.

, Be mindful to avoid any pinch points such as seat tracks or door jambs.

,


Connect the blue wire to the remote.






Then the ground wire (Black)







,, You will need to follow a process similar to that of the power wire. However, run your RCA cables on the opposite side of vehicle. You do not want to run power wires and signal cables on the same side of the vehicle. This could induce noise into your system. Connect the remote turn-on wire to your amplifier using an appropriate connector (such as a ring terminal).

, If your running your speakers from the inside of your vehicle; make sure you run them on the same side as your RCA cables.

, Most speakers have indicators that read either a + for positive or a - for negative.

, The negative wire does not have to be a long piece of wire. If possible, scrape an area that is clear of the gas tank and insert a metal screw. The metal to metal contact will conduct a chassis ground. After you have the negative terminal connected to ground, cover the connection with paint, caulk or a similar protective material to prevent rust (corrosion = noise)., After this is done, you may then insert your inline fuse.

Research head units and pick the one you like the best.,
Buy the unit.

,
Determine if your Explorer has the JBL audio system or if it not upgraded.,
Go to your local car audio shop and ask for the installation kit for your year of Explorer.,
Take out the 2 8mm screws that are located in the stock headunit in your car.,
Open the headunit box and open the wiring harness package.,
The harness' package should have a list of colors and corresponding functions.,
If, in Step 3, you determined that you DO NOT have the JBL audio system, pull both harnesses out of the package.,
If you DO have the JBL audio system, look at the wiring harness's you bought.,
ONLY IF YOU HAVE JBL Take out the passenger side kick panel.,
JBL ONLY (warning: I hold no responsibility if something goes wrong here.,
Now that you know which wire is which, cut the 4 pairs of wires.,
Now, go to the h/u (headunit) in your car and pull the trim around it.,
Unplug the 2 wiring harnesses for the factory h/u.

,
Get the h/u out of the trim by finding the tabs and pressing them and sliding it out.

,
Now, using the mounting piece and it's directions, mount the new h/u in the trim.

,
JBL ONLY Run the 8 wires from the kick up to the hole that is currently in your dash.,
NO JBL Connect the two harnesses that you hooked into the h/u to the harnesses you took out of the old h/u.

,
JBL ONLY Connect the long harness to the other piece that you unplugged from the factory h/u.,
OPTIONAL If you want have any connectors come out in the glove box, do those now.,
Now that all the wires for the h/u are in, reconnect the lighter, 4 Wheel drive, and wiper controls and screw the screws back in.

,
Slide the trim and all back in to place.

,
Put the 8mm screws back in.

,
Put the passenger kick panel back in.

,
Turn it on.

",How to Install an Aftermarket Headunit in a Ford Explorer," Important features are watts, pre-amp outputs (if you want to hook up new amps later), direct iPod connection, and there are many more.;
,, If you have JBL, you will have more work to do, but the end product will sound better.

, You will need a mounting piece, wiring harness, and if you want the tuner to work properly, an aftermarket antenna. When installing a new headunit, you will not be able to get the antenna to go up when it should, so you either need to buy one and mount it or just skip it. For me, my antenna was stuck in the up position, so I could use it.

, They are located under the radio controls, but above the A/C controls.

, Keep all packaging because it has necessary information on it.

, There should be a similar list on the headunit. Ex. Black-Ground, Red-12v (+), etc.

, Using the key in Step 7, connect the wires. You can use solder or you can twist them together. Make sure you use electrical tape to cover the connections. If you don't, wires can SHORT.

, Find the one that is long and skinny. That is the important one. Hook it in the same way. On the key, you will see things like ""Left Rear (+)"" and ""Right Front (-)."" Ignore these for now.

, You should see a bunch of wiring harness's. The one that is closest to the seat and door is the one that you want. Take a 9v battery and connect two wires to it. Then touch the wires to the wiring harness in the kick panel. If you hear a click from a speaker, you got the right harness. Then, you want to determine which speaker is which. Label the wires. If you care a lot, you can determine the polarity of each wire by taking off the door panel and touching the 9v to the wires again and look at the speaker. If the speaker goes out, then which ever wire the (+) end of the 9v is touching is + and the - is -. If it goes in, then the + is - and the - is +.

, You could mess yourself and/or your car up here. Be careful.)

, Cut them about 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the wiring harness. Now, you have 4 pairs of wires sticking out of the wring harness. Ignore these. Take the other side, the ones not connected to the harness and hook a 3 feet (0.9 m) length of 16 gauge wire to each wire. Label these ""Right Front (+)"" etc.

, It all should come out. Once you have it out a little bit, look in the back. On the side with the Rear Wiper controls, you will have to screw two Philip's screws in the back and take off the rear wiper control knob. On the side with the cigarette lighter and the 4 wheel drive knob, you will have to take out one screw. Then you need to unplug the 4 Wheel drive harness. After that, pull the two wires off the back of the lighter. Then, the whole thing should slide out.

,,,, Make sure they are labeled on each end.

,, Then using the key on the new h/u, connect the 8 wires from the kick to the wires on the new h/u.

, You may want to have a direct iPod cable or an AUX cable to be in there. Follow directions on the h/u to connect them to it.

The most cost effective first step is to buy an amplifier wiring kit off of an internet auction site, etc.,
Run the 12v power wire (usually the longest wire in the kit, mostly red, typically ranges from 8 gauge to 0 gauge) from the battery through the firewall and then to the amp.,
Find a solid metal ground somewhere near the amplifier.,
Pull the aftermarket CD player out of the dash.,
Take your remote wire that came in your amp kit and splice/solder it onto that blue and white-striped wire and run it through the dash and then along the door jam.

,
While you have the CD player removed, plug the RCA white and red plugs into the back of the deck where it says ""Subwoofer Output."",
Run all the wires straight back to the amplifier.you should run the power and remote control down the right as factory speaker wires run down the left due to fire risks if the power cable shorts out and you have your speaker cables down the same side it will blow your head deck (cd player).,
Use Speaker Wire to connect sub-woofers to amplifier.,
Hopefully by now you have a subwoofer box/enclosure.,
Be sure to know the impedance of the subwoofer(s) you are using and try to match the amplifier's impedance accordingly.,
Put a fuse into 12v wire in the engine bay no more than 0.5m away from battery.,
Connect the power wire to your battery.,
Lastly, connect the battery cable to the amplifier.,
Do not turn up the volume or gain too high or you may produce clipping in the subwoofers.",How to Install Subwoofers," This will come with a huge power wire, a short ground wire, a remote wire, and many times an inline fuse and various connectors to help keep the install organized and looking clean. Some stereo shops have huge spools of wire available by the foot. This is another cost effective alternative to buying a wiring kit, if you know the dimensions of your car.;
, You can find a hole somewhere in the bottom right of the firewall. Don't connect the power wire to the battery or the amp just yet.

, You'll need to stay within 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) of the amplifier to maintain the best ground connection. A way you can do this is pull up the carpet and scrape the metal until it is bare metal with no paint left on it. If the amplifier is to be mounted in the trunk, many times bolts from the suspension can be found directly above one of the rear wheels. These suspension components usually bolt directly to the frame, making them an ideal grounding point.

, There is a blue wire with a white stripe hanging out of the back of the deck known as the remote wire. The remote wire is a simple 12v signal that the cd player outputs to tell the amplifier to turn on.

,, If your cd player does not have a ""Subwoofer Output"", or if you are using a stock cd player, you will need a device called an inline converter. It's a small box that has 4 input wires and the 2 necessary RCA output that will run to the amplifier. It takes the high level speaker voltage and drops it to a low level signal the amplifier can process. The 4 input wires can be connected to the rear speakers (+ and - for left and right).

, RCA cables should be run down the center of the car as RCA cables can pick up sounds from wire looms and also air con vents power wires.

, Gauge isn't extremely important here, as long as the wire is copper, the resistance-per-foot is in the mili-ohm range, meaning there will be minuscule, if any, voltage drop across the wire.

, There are many different types of enclosures (sealed, vented, bandpass, infinite baffle, etc.). There are numerous articles explaining the pros and cons of each type of enclosure, far too many to list in this article. If you really want the best response possible, your subwoofer manual will list the ideal enclosure volume for each type of enclosure. If you don't want to go through all of the volume calculations, just buy a box slightly bigger, and stuff it with pillow stuffing from walmart until the subs respond the way you want them to.

, For example, if you have an amp that is 500w @ 4 ohms, and 1000w @ 2 ohms, you'll want to try to run your speakers at 2 ohms. Two 4 ohm subs can be wired in parallel to achieve this. If you're new to the impedance calculations, many amplifiers will have specific wiring diagrams in their manuals to assist.

, If your amp kit came with an ""inline fuse holder"", you'll want to find a nice location to mount it in your engine bay. Once it's secure, cut a length of the power wire to reach the fuse, and connect it to one side of the fuse holder. The other side (the side you just cut) is stripped and connected to the other side of the fuse holder.

, There's nice ring connectors and even new battery terminals you can buy (and sometimes come with the amp kit), that make the battery connection much more solid, and looks better too.

, Then under the hood clamp the wire down to the battery. A word of warning, sometimes you'll see a nice big spark the first time you touch the power wire to the battery. Don't worry about it! This is the amplifier charging the huge capacitors contained inside.

, This is where the output of the amplifier peaks and stays there for a split-second. This is bad for the subwoofer because it holds the cone (the big circle part!) in it's fully extended or fully compressed state for the duration of the clip. Not only are you not producing a single decibel of sound during this microsecond, but you're also working the voice coil very hard and damaging it. A good rule for beginners is to play a nice loud song of your genre at your cd players 3/4 volume setting. Now, with the gain at zero, turn it up until it's obvious that it isn't getting any louder. The gain knob isn't a ""volume"" knob by any means. A gain knob should usually never be at it's full position.

Look at the stereo system you are installing your new speakers on.,
Check the dimensions of the existing speakers so minimum modifications will be needed to fit the new ones in.,
Consider quality.,
Select speakers with trim packages you like.,

Remove the factory speaker.,
Connect the new speaker to the car's electrical system.,
Test the speaker.,
Secure the new speaker.,
Install and test any subwoofers.,
Install and test any tweeters.,
Replace all panels and speaker grilles.",How to Install Car Speakers," Some systems are simple stereo audio systems that have limited wattage and two or four channels, so 100 watt speakers, or adding 8 or more just won't make sense. Trying to push too many speakers can, in fact, cause the quality of the audio to be diminished, or even damage the stereo.;
, Speakers come in different shapes and sizes, so a planning to mount a replacement speaker, knowing if the original was a 6X9 inch oval rather than a 4 inch (10.2 cm) round one will help choose the best fit.

, Speakers with composite or fabric cones are usually noticeably better than those with paper, and ceramic permanent magnet speakers will out-perform wound electromagnetic speakers at the same power level.

, You may find many different styles and colors of trim and covers in a similar price range, so it makes sense to pick the ones that look good, not just sound good.

, Some have inline resistors to prevent static and crosstalk, some allow wiring in a series circuit configuration to allow you to add woofers and tweeters where you need them, and some can only be wired terminally to maintain the correct system impedance.

, High wattage speakers may not be able to perform with the factory wiring, and changing these to a larger size may mean considerable work, since factory wiring is concealed in hard to reach places.

, As noted in the intro, there are thousands of possibilities available when it comes to after-market speakers. Because of this, any single list of tools is likely to be insufficient for installing some speakers and redundant for others. The tools you'll need to install your new speaker system will probably include most of the following, but are not necessarily limited to these:A variety of screwdrivers (flathead, phillips head, etc.)
Wire cutters/strippers
Crimping tool
Allen wrenches
Socket wrenches
Hobby knife
Soldering iron (and solder)
Electric drill
File
Torx driver
""Panel popper"" tool
Electrical tape

, Many after-market speakers will fit into the spaces for the stock speakers, while others will require minor modifications, like the installation of a mounting bracket, the drilling of new screw holes, etc. Be sure to take this into account when you buy your new speakers - the installation processes for differently-sized or shaped speakers can vary in difficultly.


Note that many speaker retailers offer online tools for determining which of their products best ""fit"" your car., As with nearly all types of electrical work, it's important to protect yourself and the electrical system before beginning. Disconnecting the battery's negative terminal prevents the risk of injury from electric shock or damage to the car's electronics through short circuiting, so be sure to do so before tampering with any of the car's internal electronics.

, Since there's so many different types of speakers available, it's nearly impossible to write a how-to guide that will perfectly cover all of them. The instructions below are highly generalized and may not apply to every single set of speakers on the market. Whenever necessary, defer to the instructions included with your speakers, as these will be specifically suited to your unique product.

, Nearly all speakers in the interior of a car will be covered with some sort of protective paneling or grill. Before the speaker can be modified or replaced, this barrier must be removed. Pry the grill off with a suitable tool, like a flat head screwdriver, removing any bolts or screws that are holding it in place if necessary.


The work you'll have to do to access your car's factory speakers will vary from car to car. In worst case scenarios, for example, you may need to remove seats, crawl into the trunk to access important bolts or wires, or even remove entire door panels to gain access to the speakers.

, Note that the speaker is usually, but not always, attached to a wiring harness, so take care not to rip it out when removing it. You may also find that you need to unscrew one or more small bolts and/or chip at any adhesive foam or glue that's holding the speaker in place.


If you think you'll need to re-install the factory speakers in the future (for instance, if you sell the car), don't forget to save any screws that you remove!

, Usually, connecting your new speaker is a fairly simple matter of plugging your speaker's wiring harness into the car's wiring harness. However, if your car doesn't have this simple type of connection, you may need to connect your speaker with a soldered or crimped connection.


Make sure you match the polarity of the car and speaker's connections. Usually, the speaker's positive terminal is the larger of the two and is marked with a ""+"" or a small dot.Electrical tape can be a risky choice for wire connections, especially in the dashboard, as changes in temperature can weaken the tape and lead to problems down the road.

, Now that you've connected your speaker, it's important to test the connection so that you don't have to waste time later to fix a problem. Re-connect the battery's negative terminal and turn on the car's radio or stereo. Listen for sound coming out of your new speaker or look for visible vibrations at high volumes. If your speaker won't work, this means that there is a problem with its electrical connection.

, Once you're confident that your speaker works properly, secure it in its seat in the door or dash. If you're lucky, your new speaker will fit in the factory speaker's housing. However, your speaker may require the installation of a specially mounting bracket (usually included with the speaker itself), drilling new screw holes, and/or using adhesives to hold the speaker in place. Refer to the instructions included with your speaker.

, Subwoofers are responsible for the ultra-low, ""booming"" bass sound that some car owners idolize. If your car came with factory subwoofers, installing new woofers can be as easy as seating them in the existing housing and connecting them to the car's wiring harness. If your car didn't come with factory subwoofers, however, or you'd like to install additional ones, your task may be much harder. You may need expand your stock woofer's existing mounting holes or make significant modifications to the car to house large woofers. For instance, many people who want to add multiple woofers to their car custom-install a panel in the trunk to house the woofers.


Subwoofers often have fairly large power demands and complicated wiring schemes. You may want to buy and install a separate amplifier wiring kit to simplify the process of wiring your subwoofers.

If not, you may need to connect the woofer directly to the battery and the car's stereo and ground the woofer manually.



, As with woofers, tweeters, which produce high-pitch frequencies, can be easy or difficult to install based on the factory components of your car. If your car came with tweeters, you may only need to install the new ones in the existing housing and connect them to the existing wiring harness. If, however, there are no spaces to install the tweeters, you may need to make your own (or expand existing ones, use a mounting bracket, etc. if existing housing is insufficient). Luckily, tweeters are much smaller than woofers, so the adjustments you'll need to make will be minor in comparison.


As with woofers, if your car didn't already have any tweeters, you may need connect the tweeter directly to the battery and stereo and ground the tweeter to the car's body.

, When all the components of your new speaker system have been installed, tested, and securely mounted in the car, you may replace any speaker grills or panels that you had to remove to install the speakers. Make sure you've kept any screws that you had to remove to take the grill or panel off so that you're able to re-secure them properly.


Congratulations - your new speaker system is ready to use!

Consider your factory car stereo's options.,
Consider the method of installation into your decision process.,
Consider the expandability options.,
Finally, find the right-fitting car stereo for your vehicle.",How to Pick the Right Aftermarket Car Stereo," You can get a decent car stereo for under $100.00 in most cases.;
, If you own an iPod or iPhone, some car stereos have a USB port that will, in most cases, read files off of your device, play your device, and charge your device, all via the USB-to-30-Pin cable that came with your iPod or iPhone.


If you don't own an iPod or iPhone, the USB port on some car stereos accept USB thumb drives so it can read and play files off of the drive.
If you're looking to not spend a lot, most all car stereos include a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack that allows you to plug a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input cable into both your iPod or iPhone or other device and into the jack on the stereo itself. This method will NOT control or charge your iPod or iPhone, however, and will NOT read files off of the device.

, If you are a frequent traveler, some car stereos offer the ability to add on a SIRIUS or XM Satellite Radio tuner that installs somewhere in your car's interior. Or, in some cases, the car stereo will be satellite radio ready, and will only require an antenna to be run and connected to the back of the unit. You will need to, however, pay via a monthly or yearly subscription, for this service.

, If you are tired of listening to the standard AM and FM radio stations on your current car stereo, consider purchasing a car stereo that has a built-in HD Radio tuner. HD Radio is free to listen to, and has better sound quality than standard AM and FM radio stations do. Instead of only a single AM or FM radio station on one frequency, there are three to five additional AM or FM radio stations on that same frequency.

, If you are always in your car, some car stereos allow you to add-on Bluetooth, or buy a car stereo with Bluetooth standard. The caller's voice comes through all of your vehicle's speakers, and most car stereos include a built-in Bluetooth microphone. You connect your phone wireless to the car stereo in order to use it. Some car stereos even allow you to stream music wirelessly from your Bluetooth-enabled device.

, If you do not find yourself listening to CDs in your car a lot, then you may want to consider buying a ""mechless"", or digital media car stereo. These car stereos do NOT feature a CD player, and only a radio, with integration for iPods, iPhones, and other devices. These are generally cheaper to purchase.

, Do you have a CD changer in your trunk? Does your car have factory satellite radio? Do you have controls on the steering wheel for the radio? Do you have an upgraded factory premium sound system and/or an amplifier? Does your factory car stereo already have Bluetooth and iPod and iPhone and USB inputs? Does your vehicle use its factory car stereo to play the warning chimes through your vehicle's factory speakers? These are only some of the considerations required when replacing your vehicle's factory car stereo.

, Can you install the car stereo yourself? Or will you be paying someone or getting someone to install the car stereo for you? Most consumer electronics retailers or car audio shops will install your new car stereo for a fee. If you ARE installing the car stereo yourself, is it difficult to disassemble your vehicle's dashboard to get to the factory car stereo?

, Do you want to add any features onto your new car stereo later?

, DIN units are the most common type of car stereo, and only take up a small, rectangular space in your vehicle's dashboard. DIN-and-a-Half, or Double DIN units are used in many American and Import vehicles. They take up a larger, more square-like space in your vehicle's dashboard. A factory car stereo may require DIN tools to be removed, available at most consumer electronics retailers and car audio shops for less than $5.00, or you can make your own set of DIN tools out of old metal coat hangers.

Know your vehicle’s capability.,
Choose the class of amplifier.,
Choose where you want to place your amp within your car.,
Disconnect the negative side of your car’s battery.,
Drill a hole into your car's firewall to run your amplifier’s Power Supply Wire through.,
Engage the power cable to the positive terminal of your battery.,
Ground the amplifier for safety.,
Mount your amplifier to the car using self-tapping screws.,
Attach the power and signal cables to the amplifier.,
Connect your amp to the rest of your sound system.,
Connect your battery and power up.",How to Install an Amplifier1," Check the owner’s manual to find out what your speaker can handle. Understand how much power the current system can handle in terms of its electrical capability capacity.


First, how loud do you want your stereo to be? The amount of amp wattage doesn’t necessarily translate to how loud your car audio will sound. However, having a lot of power available is good for ""headroom"", which is the ability to deliver a burst of sound when the music asks for one. Be mindful if you drive a smaller car as a smaller amp will be adequate for its system. For example, an amp with 50 watts RMS per channel or smaller can overcome road noises and add clarity. Ensure you use speakers with a top RMS rating of at least 35 watts RMS with amps of this size.For larger vehicles or for those who just want more volume, look to use an amp with a 75 watts RMS per channel setup. Amps of this size need speakers with a top RMS rating of 50 watts RMS or more.If you want maximum volume, an amp with 100 watts RMS or more per channel will truly set you apart. Speakers or component sets rated with at least 75 watts RMS each can handle amps of this power.;
, Amplifiers can be organized into a 4-class system based on efficiency, size and cost.


Class A is 25% efficient, which means that for every 100 watts of electricity used, only 25 of those watts go to power your speakers. These amps are considered low-quality and should not be used for cars.
Class A/B amps are 50-60% efficient in their power use. They typically are smaller, use less power, and cost less than Class A designs. Most car audio amplifiers use this class of amps because of their efficiency and compact size.
Class D is known as a switching amplifier that works well for subwoofer use. This class has better efficiency at a smaller size than Class A/B amps. This class of amps is 70-75% efficient in their power use.
Class G/H designs use multiple output voltage levels for a 75-80% efficiency. At a low volume, these amplifiers remain at a low voltage. As you increase the volume, the amp utilizes the second (higher) voltage level, and at the highest volume all voltages combine to maximize your output. These amplifiers are smaller in size with relatively higher power output compared to Class A/B amps.

, Your amp should be at least three feet from the receiver to eliminate distortion produced from your vehicle's electrical system.


Don’t bolt your amplifier directly to your car's metal chassis as noise problems, like ground loops that hum or buzz, are easily generated. Use rubber grommets around the mounting screws to isolate the case or mount your amp onto a wooden board and attach it to your car.Keep your amp cool. An amp produces heat, which its heatsink absorbs and radiates, so keep a few inches of air space around it to allow the heat to dissipate. Keep the fins on the heatsink vertical if you’re placing your amp on the wall of your car. Never mount an amp upside down, as this won’t allow heat to dissipate but rather radiate back into the amp.Make room on either side of your amp for wiring connections. You also need enough room to adjust controls like gain, crossover, bass boost, etc.Common places to store your amp are under the seat or in the trunk, as wires can be easily hidden and controls are easily accessed.

, Use a 1/2"" wrench to loosen the negative battery clamp and your fingers to remove it from the battery.If it’s stuck, use pry bars to pry open the soft lead battery cable end.Make sure to disconnect the negative side first; if the wrench slips while you're disconnecting the positive side, it can form an arc that will shock you.
Remove jewelry, especially rings. If you are accidentally shocked, the heat produced can melt jewelry into your skin.Check your owner’s manual, but generally, positive is red and negative is black. You should also look for (+) positive and (-) negative signs., Create a pilot hole with a power drill and steel bit, then use larger bits to expand the hole into the proper width to fit your wire after a rubber grommet is used. Make sure the hole does not have any sharp burr or it will short to the amp wires. Connect your amp’s Power Supply Wire from the positive slot to the corresponding positive terminal on your battery.To determine which is the positive terminal on your amp, look for red or the positive (+) sign.
Use a rubber grommet so that the wire doesn’t rub and chafe as this can cause a fire.
Check the area before drilling as you want to avoid hitting the cables of other components.Insert a fuse at the battery to protect your car from catching fire as well as another fuse at the amp to protect it in case of a short.

, Remove the nut from the battery terminal. Slip the power cable's ring over the bolt that secures the battery terminal to the battery post, and replace the nut. Many cables in wiring kits come with ring terminals. In case you don’t have one, crimp it onto the end of the power cable before proceeding.
Make sure that the wire does not have an opportunity to get pinched, kinked or rubbed as you drive., Use a bolt in your car’s metal frame that’s as close to your amp as possible. Drill a hole and add a ground screw or bolt if you can’t find one but check for your wiring, gas tank, or brake line before drilling. Crimp a ring terminal to the short piece of ground cable.Scrape away any paint and clean the grounding location of your car’s metal frame thoroughly before installing the bolt. Keep this connection tight, clean, and electrically conductive with a lock washer, a star washer, extra screws, or any other grounding technique.Washers are inexpensive and can be purchased at your local hardware store and are also known as O- rings.
Don’t use any bolts that are part of your seat belt because this can compromise its integrity and your safety.

, If these screws don’t come with your amp’s installation kit, buy them at your local hardware store and simply line up your amplifier, and drill in the screws making sure you have proper clearance for the screws and they do not go into any thing other than the metal body., Neatly trim each wire, placing them in the desired position, and connect them. Make gentle curves with these wires if necessary as sharp bends could pinch. Cut small slits into your vehicle's carpeting so that you can run these wires underneath for a neat and professional aesthetic.Use an uncoiled wire coat hanger to thread your wire underneath the carpet if you lack the proper tools.

, Run each wire for your door speakers through the grommet to protect them from harsh weather or from getting pinched in the door. Remove your factory speaker wires. Connect the new wires that are connected to your amp directly to each speaker terminal.Use 14 or 16 gauge wire for speakers and 12 or 14 gauge for subwoofers. It is important that you keep the polarity of your speaker wiring straight by ensuring positive terminals connect with each other and negative ones do the same. This ensures that all the speaker cones have the same type of signal and move in the same direction, creating a balanced sound when played together., Turn on your car, then turn on the radio. There’s an indicator light on your amp that will tell you if your amp has been initiated.Turn the volume up to an audible level and verify that sound is coming from each speaker and/or subwoofer in your system.Make sure all amp settings are at a minimum level before turning on your stereo system.

Know what kind of amp you need for your home theater’s capability.,
Choose the type of amplifier configuration.,
Organize your equipment.,
Position your preamplifier within your home theater.,
Organize your cables.,
Connect your input sources to your preamplifier.,
Connect your preamplifier to your amplifier.,
Turn on your system.",How to Install an Amplifier2," Depending on your budget and desired sound, your home theater will need an amplifier and preamplifier specific to your needs. An amplifier increases the power available to your speakers while a preamplifier controls everything and needs both an amplifier and speaker to function.A tube amp uses a vacuum tube where a single ended triode tube amp works well with high efficiency speakers.
FET amp stands for Field Effect Transistor because it uses an electric field. This type of amp is a popular solid state amp.
Class A amps produce almost no distortion with a maximum amount of power.
Class B amps produce some distortion and need to be turned on.
Class AB amps are a combination of Class A and B where a signal switches between a Class A and B circuit.

, Amplifiers have many different configurations that can be based on the number of speakers, type of speakers, and room configuration.


If you’re simply using a pair of speakers, stereo amps are a common choice.
If you have a number of different high powered speakers, monoblock amps can be setup for each.
If your home theater is advanced with five inputs or more, multichannel amps are best.

, Your equipment will depend on how involved your home theater will be but the basic requirements are the input sources, amplifiers, preamplifiers, and cable connectors.Input sources are whatever you choose to plug into your speakers including Blu-Ray players, DVD players, and stereos.
Cable connectors should come with input sources but if you need more or need extended lengths, go to your local home theater specialist.

, Your preamp should be easily accessible with space for both input and output cables.If you’re using a home theater cabinet, make sure there is an opening in the back or remove any covering that can obstruct your cables.

, Depending on how many input sources you have, you may need to label each cable. Keep your cables organized as you connect them to your preamp.Wrap masking tape near the plug of the connector and label each source.

, Run cables from the back of your input devices to input plugs in your preamplifier.


Ensure that you’re using the right cable and are connecting it to the right input plug in the preamp as there can be many plugs.
Ensure that the plug is firmly connected to the slot.

, Connect cables from the output terminals of your preamp to input plugs at the back of your amplifier. Your amplifier will be connected to your speakers via the output terminals.Do not connect a two channel amp to more than two speakers because it will damage your amp.

, Choose your input source and turn on your amplifier and preamplifier. Never connect your amplifier while the power is on as it will create a power surge and, depending on your volume control, a nasty sound.While any amp can be used with any preamp, they can also come as a single integrated unit. The difference between a single unit and a 2-piece combination is the flexibility you have when setting up your home theater and the power you can have available to you.

Take these wires and strip off the insulation of all the wires.,
Attach each wire to its matching color.,
Wrap the exposed wire with electrical tape.,
Plug in the radio antenna.,
Re-attach your ground, turn your car on and test out your head unit.,
Install the panels back on, if everything else is working.",How to Install an After Market Head Unit on a 1996 1998 Honda Civic," These two items will allow your Honda to be able to install aftermarket head units.


You will also need a Philips screwdriver(star screwdriver) which you will use for unscrewing screws, wire strippers or something to strip the insulation off wires to expose the actual wire, and electrical tape.;
, The reason is so you don't short circuit anything when installing the equipment. The ground is marked by a - sign on the battery and is usually black. To remove, simply loosen the clamp. This is usually done with a socket, different clamps have different ways of loosening them, and slip off the clamp from the terminal.

, The center console and the lower dash are just 2 panels of plastic that hide you car's internal and make the interior look nice. These panels are just held on by some screws. To get to your first set of screws look at your original head unit. Underneath you will see the cigarette lighter plug. Right above the cigarette lighter plug, you will see two Philips screws (which are star shapes screws). Unscrew these two screws with your screwdriver.

, Unscrew that one as well.

, While it's open this will let the glove box swing down farther than it usually does. Once you have done this, the screw will be on the bottom left hand side of the glove box. Unscrew it.

, Here you will find 3 more screws underneath the steering on the lower dash. The screws are clearly visible and they are also Philips screws. Unscrew all these screws. Now you will be able to remove the panel around the steering column; it's held in place by some snaps. Just pull gently and it will come off.

, It was a Philips screw, that was located to the right of the steering column.

,, Before the center panel comes off completely, you need to remove the wire leading to the back of the cigarette lighter. There will be a clip attached to the back of that that gives power to the lighter plug, simply disconnect the clip. Now you can completely remove the center console.

, The head unit is held by one or two screws which are at the back of the radio. The only way to access these screws is to go through where the center console was and there you can access the the screw(s) at the rear of the head unit which are also Philips screws. Unscrew these screws. If you have difficulty removing these screws, they are also 8mm bolts, so you can use a ratchet or other tools to remove them. Now you will be to pull out the radio or you can push it out by reaching behind.

, You also need to pull out the antenna plug which is a separate black wire attached to the head unit. Just simply pull on that wire. You may also have a third plug, on the back-left side. This one is quite hard to pull out. Wiggle the plug from side to side, and it will eventually disconnect itself.

,, Insert the mounting kit where the old head unit was and it should fit in place. Don't forget to insert the included rectangle-shaped plastic spacer, if applicable.


If you have one, now is the time to install the DIN cage (metal cage your radio fits in). Just slip it in to the hole in the dash, and bend the tabs so that the cage stays there. It holds the installation kit in place, too.

, Here you will need your aftermarket wiring harness. Simply connect the aftermarket wiring harness to the clip that was attached to the radio.

, Strip also all the wires on the wiring harness.Your aftermarket deck should have come with the wires attached to it.


Notice that the colors of the wires on the wiring harness are the exact same colors that are on the aftermarket head unit. All aftermarket wiring harnesses and head unit have the same color wires and all the wires are meant to do the same thing.

, To attach the wires together you take the two wires and twist the bare wire which you have exposed when you stripped the wires.

, Do this with all the colors.

, Plug to the aftermarket head unit and insert the head unit in your mounting kit and DIN cage. It should fit snugly.

, Make sure all the speakers are working. If a speaker does not work or the head unit does not turn on you probably mixed up wires somewhere.

, It is just the reverse of what you did before.

Have all components, tools ready and checked.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System1," This includes drills, drill bits, island keys, and wrenches. But most importantly, make sure you have the correct wires for the job.

"
"
Gather the necessary materials.,
The best way to connect multiple amps when it comes to REM, is through one remote wire.,
Best thing to do is for power wire is connect each amp with a separate power using a distribution block, which is essentially a casing that allows one wire to supply power to multiple wires (one wire from the battery goes in and three wires can come out).

,
Connect one power wire (wire that connects from the battery to the amps) to your distribution block.,Have the the remaining wire go to each amp as a power wire

,
Make sure each amp has its own separate ground.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System2," Remember that each amp needs a power, a ground, and a REM (remote) wire going through them.;
, Since the remote wire basically tells the amp when the radio is on, all amps can be connected to the same remote wire.

,, Your thickest or lowest gauge wire should be your main one.

,, just ground it to any piece of metal. Wire can burn and melt if too much current is running through it so one wire is your best bet.

Know your amps' and sub woofers' limits.,
Connect all subs to the same terminals in the amp.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System3," This is crucial to achieve perfect precision with 4, 6, and 8 or more sub woofers.


An amp that is rated at 1000w RMS (Root Mean Square, or the average watt the speaker is intended to receive and play with) set for 1 ohm can power two 2-ohm subs rated at 500w RMS.
That same amp can power four 4ohm subs and so forth. But the more subs an amp is placed on, the less power it can give to each individual sub. This is not necessarily a bad thing if you have a 2000w RMS amp and two 600w RMS subs. In fact, you always want the power from the amp to be slightly higher than what the sub(s) requires; a 1000w amp will work well with a 7 or 800W RMS sub.
Just make sure that the sub's peak power is rated above 1000w. If rated under, make sure your amp's level is not too high as you can damage the sub.
If you have a really powerful amp that's 3000w RMS or higher, then you can really power multiple subs at once without any problem. Just make sure the subs don’t combine to read at 0.5 ohm (a dangerous level for an amp, unless it specifies that it can run at that low ohm level) and all your wires are properly connected and wired.

, However, depending on whether you wish to connect them in series or parallel or bridge the amp, you may only use two terminals. Refer to your amp's diagram for more specifics.

"
"
These are also known as ""door speakers"", ""vocal speakers"", ""6 by 5"" or ""6 by 9"" and more.,
Make sure your 4-channel amp can play them all without being so powerful that they damage the speakers.,
Connect all mids and highs with the same power and ground.,
Connect all speakers through the adjacent speakers that are pre-wired through the car.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System4," If you're trying to install more than what your car originally came with, the same rules should be applied to those of subs.

, Because most speakers are rated to 8 ohms, you can generally connect many speaker to one amp without any problems.

, All cars have pre-wired powers and grounds that go through the doors and the back dash. It would be foolish to run multiple wires through your door and dash to play multiple speakers with such low wattage.

, Just make sure the power and ground are positioned properly throughout the process.

"
"
Follow the general rule: for power, ground and speaker wires, the lower the number and thicker the wire, the better.,
Always use the biggest but most appropriate wire in case you decide to upgrade your sound system.,
Make everything color coded and neat.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System5," (Remote and RCA wires are always small.) People tend to underestimate the amount and size of wires that they need when installing many components in a car audio systems.


If you have the chance of using 6-gauge wires as your power instead of 8, then do so. It may save you a lot of time and money.

,


If you previously had a 1000W system, then that 8 gauge wire may work. But if you upgrade to more powerful amps and subs, say 3000w, that 8 gauge will burn and melt in no time at all. Then you will have to remove it, and rewire the car with 2 gauge wire.
If you have a feeling that you may go bigger in the future, chose bigger wire.
Multiple Wires can lead to ground noise. People with many components and wires running through their car can easily end up getting ""ground noise,"" which is the whining sound that plays through your speakers and rises and falls with the rev of your engine.
Although there are many products that claim to reduce ground noise, the best method is positioning the main power wire and RCAs/4-channel amps as far away from each other as possible.
A large power wire can create massive amounts of electromagnetic interference that can be picked up by RCA's of a 4-channel, and subsequently relayed back through the radio and mids and highs as ground noise. Fix the problem by running the power wire to the left of the driver side seat and placing the amp and RCA's under the passenger seat.

,


If power is red wire, ground is black, and remote is blue, then you will have an easier time keeping track of your wires and what they connect to. Otherwise, if one amp fails, you may find yourself overwhelmed and needlessly tearing out wires.

"
Determine whether you need multiple batteries and capacitors.,
There are three ways to go: capacitors, alternators, and batteries.,
The cheapest way to fix a major power problem is with more batteries.,
Systematically connect the next battery by running a wire from the first battery power, to the second battery power, and so on until you reach the last battery.

,
Connect the last battery to the amp(s) with a separate wire.,
You can upgrade your alternator, if you don’t want numerous batteries or capacitors to take up space in your car.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System6,"


If you have a 3000w amp playing three 1000w subs, but they really sound weak, then it's time to get more power.
Alternatively, play the bass as loud as you can and see if your dome lights dim or not. If they barely flicker, then your power is manageable, but if they almost go dark with each bass note, then it's time for more power.

, Capacitors are usually small cylinders that come with a digital display showing your voltage in your car. They are rated by Farad's and the higher they are, the better the cap can store and release volts.


Be warned: many capacitors are nothing more than expensive voltage meters. They are for very minor power problems and simply add a more sophisticated look to an audio system. A 1-farad capacitor could potentially cost hundreds of dollars and not solve any power problems.
The ideal voltage for a car audio system varies. For a low-end system, 13.5-13.7 is just fine. For average systems, 13.8-14 is good, but for high-end audio systems, 14.4 and above is where you want to be.
Your voltage should not drop below 12 volts, as that’s an indication of a big power problem. Anything below 9 is extremely bad and should not be used until more power is added. You may completely drain your existing car battery and render it useless.

, Although wet cells can be used, they could spill battery acid in your car if they leak. Dry cell batteries are a better choice if you can afford them. Dry cells have no battery acid and are extremely safe in a vehicle. # To install multiple batteries (or capacitors), connect the main battery in the engine bay with the another one elsewhere in the car that has a large, low gauge wire (like a 4 or 2).

,, Connect the batteries in the car with a large ground wire and ground it in metal. You don’t have to run it into the engine bay; any good metal ground will do.


Be sure to put them in a sequence: first battery connected to the main in engine bay and last battery connected to the amp(s).

,


By getting a larger alternator that puts of more amperage, your battery will be continuously and quickly charged.
Whenever massive amounts of power is needed, it's directed from the alternator much more than the battery, giving you more power.
A good 220-amp alternator can really make a difference in sound quality and bass. You just have to find it for a good price and have it installed.

Determine if your Toyota pickup is pre-wired.,
Decide on the type of car radio you want to install.,
Remove old radio or existing covers.,
Prepare to install the new unit.,
Test the new radio thoroughly.",How to Install a Radio in a Toyota Pickup," Most base model vehicles come pre-wired, allowing the manufacturer or a service technician to upgrade and install a car radio. Or, the original factory installed radio may be missing or defective. In either case, the electrical connections to the power source and speakers could be intact.


Locate the wiring harness to assess its condition. The antennae and power wires should also be inspected before proceeding.
If any wires on the harness or in the dash are damaged or frayed, speak to a sales consultant at an electronics store about replacement kits.;
, There are many aftermarket stereo systems that can retrofit in the dashboard of a Toyota pickup. Depending on how much money you have to spend, installing a car stereo system can allow you to enhance your driving experience with additional features.


Review the optional features at the electronics store. Navigation devices, MP3, even video players are features incorporated in modern high tech car audio systems.

, Disconnect the battery in your vehicle. Remove any cover that may hide the empty space where the radio should fit. Be careful not to break any plastic components. If you are replacing or upgrading a radio, remove the screws in the face plate or other covers with the appropriate screwdriver and pull the old unit out. Disconnect wiring.

, Make sure the new car radio fits snugly in the opening on the dash. If the unit is too tight, check for any springs, wires, or other obstacles. Return the unit for exchange if it does not slide in securely without being forced.


Attach all the wiring, including the antennae, the hot wire power source, and the wiring harness. Verify all connections are snapped together correctly.







, Reconnect the vehicle's battery terminals. Following the manufacturer's instruction manual, turn the radio on and verify that all speaker connections are working properly. Test the equalizer, the fade and balance controls, and all other functions, including, if applicable, CD, MP3, and other features. Adjust the clock and other programmable features.

Check and double-check all connections.,
Make sure all amps are properly grounded and REMnd.,
Finally, use electrical tape (your best friend when dealing with wire) to cover up exposed wire.",How to Install a Multiple Component Car Audio System7," Before you turn on your car, make sure all connections are solid and correct., Excess wire should not be sticking out and relatively close other wires of different charge. Use fuses for all battery to amp connections. If you blow a 60- or 80-amp fuse just by listening to music, then check specialty stores for 200- and 300-amp fuses.

, A thin strip can stop your entire system from being nothing but overpriced junk.

, Be careful to remove all screws before trying to pry off the trim or you may break it., For some cars, you may need to remove several pieces of plastic trim, usually working from the bottom up.If you need to remove trim that includes any knobs or drawers, remove them before trying to pry off the trim.
Use your hands or a pry tool to pry off each piece of trim. Pry tools are specifically for this purpose and will not damage the trim pieces.

, If you need to remove any components before being able to access the stereo, do so.


Disconnect components that are wired to the car. Take a picture of how each is wired for later reference.

, Different cars may have varying elements securing the stereo in place.


If the stereo is held in place by screws or nuts, loosen them with the appropriate tool (screwdriver or nutdriver, respectively).
If the stereo isn't held in place by screws or nuts, you'll need to use a radio-removal key. This tool is commonly necessary in Ford vehicles. Radio-removal keys (sometimes also referred to as radio-removal tools) will typically either be in an elongated horseshoe shape or will have a circular shape at one end and a notched shaft at the other. They’re available at most auto-parts stores.
Insert the keys into the two small slots in the face of the stereo. You will release a mechanism holding the stereo in place. Slide the radio-removal keys into each slot again until you feel the stereo loosen from in its housing. You should then be able to pull out the stereo relatively easily.

, You may want to use needle-nose pliers to grip the edge of the stereo and help you pull it out.Pull it gently, and if the stereo doesn't come out easily, double check that you haven't missed any components that may be holding it in place.

, This is an important step because the photo will serve as a reference later when you’re wiring in the new stereo.

, You’ll see a series of wires connected to the back of the stereo, and you’ll need to disconnect each of them.


First unplug the antenna wire, which will typically be a thicker wire plugged in separately from the rest. Once it’s unplugged, you should be able to move the stereo around more freely.
Next unplug the each of the wire harness connectors. There will typically be several of these and you can recognize them because a series of wires will feed into each one. The plastic piece into which the wires are fed should have either a tab or a button you can push, which will release the harness.

, Match the wires of the car’s harnesses to the new stereo’s harnesses. Each harness connector is unique, so it should be easy to figure out which ones fit together.


To be safe, check the wiring diagrams for both your car and the new stereo to verify you’ve connected them correctly.
If your car's stereo doesn’t use wire harnesses, you’ll need to match up each wire manually. The wires are color-coded; however, the wires on an after-market stereo may not match with the color-coded wires in your vehicle. It's best to study and follow the wiring diagram that came with the stereo.
Connect the matched wires. There are two options for connecting the wires, crimping or soldering. Crimping is faster and easier, but soldering will provide a more stable and secure connection. Be sure to use the proper size crimper and don’t try to bundle the wires with tape — it will eventually dry out and fall off. Bundle wires using zip ties instead., If your new stereo came with a separate mounting kit, assemble it according to the stereo's instructions (it will often mean fitting a metal housing sleeve into the mounting frame).


Push down on the tabs located around the metal sleeve with a screwdriver to secure the metal sleeve in place.

, Typically, if you have a wiring harness, this connection will be made when you connect the new stereo harnesses to the harnesses in the car.


If you aren't using a wiring harnesses, you’ll need to manually connect the power. Determine whether your car has a switched power source (typically a red wire) or a constant power source (typically a yellow wire). Some vehicles even have both types of power sources. For more information on switched versus constant power, go here.

, If you're using wiring harnesses, this connection will be made when you connect the harness pieces.


If you aren't using a wiring harness, you'll need to locate the bolt, wire, or screw that connects with the car's bare metal chassis. Loosen the bolt, wire, or screw and slip the stereo's ground wire (usually black) underneath, then tighten.
Note that the ground connection is important to the optimal performance of the stereo. If the ground wire doesn't connect to the bare metal, it won't work. And if the ground wire connection is loose, it could result in poor audio output. Sand down the area with sand paper to ensure a good connection.

, Plug in the antenna cable and connect the stereo's wiring adapter to the the car's wire harness. Connect the output converter if one is needed to make the new stereo compatible with the car's audio system.

, Turn the power on and test the AM, FM, and CD components. Test the fade and balance settings to be sure the speakers are working properly. Turn the power back off.

, When the stereo is fully in, you should hear it click into place.

, Fasten in any screws that are needed to hold the stereo in place, reconnect any wired components, and replace any knobs or drawers that were removed.

, Double check that all screws and trim pieces are securely in place.

, Turn the car power on again and play around with the stereo and its settings to be sure everything is in working order.

You should make sure to get a trim plate for the outer face of the stereo.
A DIN cage or mounting bracket may be necessary to secure the stereo to your dash.
You should also purchase a wiring harness adapter so that you can plug your new stereo into your car’s electrical system., This list can change from vehicle to vehicle, but the basic tools include: screwdrivers, wire strippers, wire cutters, and electrical tape. You might also need a panel remover tool and factory stereo removal pins depending on your vehicle.

, This can be very helpful in knowing exactly which pieces of dash to remove and how to remove them. If your owner's manual or service manual does not provide the details you need, you might try looking for a Haynes Service Manual for your car., This is the negative, commonly seen as the black terminal of the battery. You never want to work on your cars electronics with this connected as it might result in damage to the electrical system or injury to yourself.

, Using the manual from above, determine which pieces of your dash must be taken off to remove the factory stereo. These pieces may pull right off with a panel remover, or they may be held on with screws, bolts, or clips.








, Once any necessary pieces of dashboard have been removed you can take out your stereo. Sometimes the stereo is bolted or screwed onto the dash and sometimes you will need to use special tools that are inserted into the face of the factory stereo to release it from the dashboard. This procedure will vary from car to car.







, If you opted out of buying a wiring harness adapter, you may have to cut the wires instead of just pulling them out. Some vehicle manufacturers may void warranties if wiring is cut. Cut only as a last resort.








, The aftermarket wiring harness adapter is specifically designed to fit your vehicle's wiring harness. This allows you to simply plug the new harness adapter into the factory radio harness and makes wiring your stereo fairly straightforward.

, The new radio will have a plug that must be spliced to the wiring harness. The harness adapter and plug are made to go together easily. This adapter set up will allow you to plug the car's original wiring harness into your stereo. A few quick steps is all that it takes to connect the new stereo plug and wire harness adapter.


Match the colors and sizes of wires on the plug to their identical counterparts on the wiring harness adapter.
Strip approximately two inches insulation off of all of the wires and twist matching wires together. This provides superior surface area connection to crimping and more flexibility than soldering.Cover the splice with electrical tape or a twist on wire nut
If you have any trouble matching the wires, follow the steps provided with the wiring harness adapter. The wires on the harness adapter and plug are usually color coded or tagged for easy identification and matching.

, Now that the wiring harness adapter is plugged into the wiring harness and attached to the stereo plug, all you need to do is plug it into the back of your stereo. Now the wiring of your stereo is complete!








, This step will differ with each car and may require first sliding in a DIN cage, or simply mounting the aftermarket stereo onto the original mounting brackets.








, Make sure no wires have become disconnected or pinched. Reconnect the negative battery terminal and power up your vehicle. Make sure that all features of the radio and all the speakers are working.

, If it doesn't work, you likely have a loose connection or have joined the wires incorrectly. Disconnect the negative battery terminal and troubleshoot.


Make sure that the original wiring harness and aftermarket wiring harness adapter are securely attached.
Make sure that all of the connections between the aftermarket wiring harness adapter and the aftermarket stereo plug are correct. Double check with the manual that came with the aftermarket stereo or adapter.
Ensure that the aftermarket stereo plug is properly and tightly plugged into the back of the aftermarket stereo.

, Once the new stereo works, secure it into the dash and put everything back together. This is the same way that dash was disassembled, but in reverse.








, If you unplugged the terminal again after testing the battery, you can reconnect it now.








, Your installation is complete and you can show off your new aftermarket stereo.

",How to Get a High Performance Car Audio System,"


Car stereo systems with a standard-size, push-button display screen are equipped with buttons for programming radio stations, display features and switching between stereo functions.
Car audio systems with enlarged LCD displays are often equipped with touch-screen capabilities to allow you to program and operate the system's functions by touching the screen instead of pushing buttons. These systems are more expensive and may not fit in smaller or older cars.;
,


Some high-end car audio systems come equipped with docking stations that can be programmed to play songs off an iPod or MP3 player. Be sure your model and brand of device will be compatible with the stereo system you choose.

,


Car audio systems with Bluetooth functions can be programmed to operate a Bluetooth hands-free device, such as a cell phone. This type of system will be more expensive, but will make your commute safer.

,


Some car stereo systems are equipped to play ""burned"" CDs that have had songs copied from your home computer or MP3 player. Not all car sound systems include this capability as a standard feature, so verify the system you're considering can play these CDs.

,


Trunk-mounted systems are housed in the car's trunk and need to be specially wired. These provide better security, since they can't be seen, but are less convenient when driving.
Dashboard mounted systems replace the car's factory stereo and sound system. This is the most common mounting method.
Some systems are designed to be mounted in a car's glove compartment or under a seat. They provide more security, because they are more difficult for thieves to access, but can be more difficult to operate while driving.

,


Purchase a multi-year warranty on your car audio system in case it gets damaged or stolen. Choose a warranty that includes all parts of the system, is several years and costs a one-time fee rather than an annual charge.

,


High performance car stereo systems often come with optional anti-theft features like removable face plates or password encoding that prevents the system from being operated without a password when disconnected from the car's battery. These anti theft options will cost extra, but will help protect your investment.

,


Get your car audio system through a business that specializes in high-end automotive audio systems and installing them. These experts will be more knowledgeable about options that suit your car and price range than if you shopped at an electronics or department store.

,


Car audio systems start at around $150 for a simple interface, which is the faceplate that houses the radio and CD player components. Additional speakers and sub woofers cost $200 and up. Know how much you can spend when you shop and get a system that fits that range or that allows you to get a starter system that allow you to add woofers, tweeters and other components.

This could include things such as a dash kit, wiring harness, or antenna adapter. , You do not want the system to have live power while you are making your connections. Turn the vehicle off and remove the cables from your battery.

, A vehicle repair manual is highly recommended. Also, the vehicle specific kit will contain detailed information on radio removal.


Removal of dashboard components may be required, and if you don't know how to remove the parts properly, permanent damage may occur.
In some cases, you may find two pairs of holes or slots on the left and right of the face of the radio. These are called ""key holes"" and will require a special tool that can be purchased at most car audio stores or online to release the head unit.

, With most harnesses, you will have to squeeze a clip or two for the harness to release from the radio. Make sure that you examine the harness before pulling on it. Be sure the harness you purchased fits the vehicle harness. If it doesn't, take the radio to a car audio shop and have them locate the correct harness adapter.

, Using a pair of pliers at the base of the wire may help. Make sure you are pulling on the connector and not the wire as this will cause signal loss.

, Use either the cage mount method (which involves using the metal sleeve that goes around your radio) or the ISO mount method which involves using the screws that were included with the radio. When ISO Mounting a radio you use the factory brackets or brackets supplied with the new ISO Mount dash kit to Mount the radio.


Do not cut an ISO Mount kit and install the metal radio sleeve!
If you cannot find the screws you can usually purchase them at your local car audio shop. Make sure they do not exceed the maximum limits the manufacturer specifies or you will damage the radio.

, Attach it to the harness you purchased making sure to match the colors exactly including the color of the stripe (i.e. white to white, black to black, orange with white stripe to orange with white stripe).


Strip approximately two inches insulation off of all of the wires and twist matching wires together. This provides superior surface area connection to crimping and more flexibility than soldering.Cover the splice with electrical tape or a twist on wire nut
If you have any trouble matching the wires, follow the steps provided with the wiring harness adapter. The wires on the harness adapter and plug are usually color coded or tagged for easy identification and matching.
Some solder has lead in it, so avoid breathing in the fumes when you solder.

, Connect the wiring harness you prepared and the antenna. Make sure after you connect the wiring that the radio works properly. This way you can find any wiring or radio problems before you reassemble everything.


Connect to the radio's wiring harness or harness adapter directly to the vehicle's wiring harness. It is designed to simply plug in.
Connect the antenna wire to the back of the radio. This rarely, but occasionally, requires an adapter.

, This step will vary depending on what kind of head unit you have chosen, but instructions will be provided with your unit. If the unit does not fit into the same space, it should have come with a modification kit to make it fit properly. If your kit did not come with this, you should purchase one from your nearest car stereo retailer.

, Now that your head unit is back in, you can put your interior back together. Be sure to replace all clips and screws in the proper place and order. Do not force anything that doesn't fit. Consult your service manual if there are any portions of the dash that you are unsure how to install.

, It is time to enjoy your new audio system!

, If you have an amp in your system you want to make sure that you wire it in as well. The remote turn-on wire is very important. It tells your amp when the car is on or off and prevents the amp from draining your battery. This wire will either plug directly into the back of your head unit, or need to be connected to the power supply to the head unit or another power supply., RCA cables are the insulated cables that transmit the sound signal from your head unit to the amp. They should plug into the RCA ports on your head unit. If they are not already run, be sure to run these cables on the opposite side of the car as the amp’s power wire to avoid signal disruption., It is important to make sure that your amp and head unit are working well together. You need to reset the gain on your amp to compliment your new head unit.

Determine what kind of subwoofer you want.,
Consider the available specs options:


Power.,
Choose your genre.,
Search the Internet for product reviews.,
Shop around for the make and model you want to get the best price.

",How to Choose Subwoofers for Your Car Stereo," All subwoofers come in a variety of sizes ranging from 8 inches (20.3 cm) to 15 inches (38 cm) and must be fitted in an enclosure (speaker box) and connected to an amplifier. The difference between the different types of subwoofer speakers lies in the enclosure/amplifier setup:


Component subwoofers come speaker only, meaning you have to choose the enclosure and amplifier separately. You can choose from a variety of enclosure types or have one made to your specifications. Component subwoofers are ideal for those who want a highly customized car stereo system.
Enclosed subwoofers are pre-mounted in a box. You must choose an external amplifier for this type of speaker.
Powered subwoofers include the speaker and the amp in 1 compact enclosure and are ideal for installing in small spaces, but not for producing big bass.
Vehicle-specific subwoofers are designed to fit in the out-of-the-way spaces of your car, like the door, for example. These are perfect if you desire a discreet install for your car subwoofers, but they will not create a big bass sound.;
, If you want big, rich bass sounds, you will want high-powered subwoofer speakers.
Sensitivity. A subwoofer with higher sensitivity requires less power to handle big sound.
Frequency range. If you want your subwoofer to be able to handle extremely low frequency sounds, you will need a high frequency range speaker.
Enclosure type. The type of enclosure you choose for your car subwoofers has an effect on the quality of sound they produce.
Number of voice coils. You can choose either single or dual voice coils. Custom car stereo system enthusiasts generally prefer dual voice coils because they offer more flexibility in wiring the sound system.
Impedance. The impedance affects current flow and ranges from 2 to 8 ohms. It is important that your amplifier matches your speaker's impedance.

, This will determine how many car subwoofers you should purchase. Generally speaking, you only need 2 subwoofers if you listen to hip hop, dance, techno or other bass-heavy music genres. Otherwise, 1 subwoofer should do.

, Once you've settled on your subwoofer type and specifications, research your available options online.

",How to Shop for a Car Alarm System,"


As with any major purchase, setting a budget is an important first step. Consider how much money you can comfortably afford to use for the purchase of a car alarm system. While alarm systems can vary quite a bit in price, a quality machine can usually be found in any price range.;
,


Some of the more basic car alarm systems will alarm only when direct damage is done to the car. In contrast, others begin alarming at the mere sensation of motion, and others even contain theft-tracking software. Finally, the most advanced alarm systems may alert emergency companies and organizations when triggered. Be aware that in most cases, as more features are added to the system, the higher the price of the machine will be.






Alarm systems may also vary in how they are turned off. While some can be turned off simply by pressing a button on a key chain, others must be physically manipulated for the alarm to stop.






Those who are not familiar with alarm systems may want to purchase a package which allows for the installation of the product by the retailer. While this additional feature can be pricey, it is well worth it for those who are not mechanically oriented.







,


The cost of repairing a damaged car can be quite high for insurance companies. Due to these high costs, some insurance companies are now providing incentives for customers to purchase and install car alarm systems, such as lower insurance rates. With a lower car insurance premium, a higher-priced and more complex alarm system may be more affordable.

,


As discussed previously, good alarm systems can be found at any price. Similarly, alarm systems which are not as effective can also range in price. Read up on the system you are considering before making a purchase. In addition, research the warranties provided by various systems before settling on a particular product.
Speaking with car repair shops and car insurance professionals can also help you evaluate the quality of various products. These individuals deal with car repairs on a daily basis, and should be able to provide an unbiased opinion on the systems.







,


Once you have finally settled on a particular machine, start hunting for deals. Depending on the stores you visit, the cost of a particular style and brand can be quite different. Read local newspapers and check online websites to determine if any upcoming adds can save you money on the car alarm system you have decided to purchase.

Discuss alarm installation with your dealership.,
Talk to law enforcement professionals.,
Decide which features are right for you.,
Consider external alarms.,
Research alarm companies.,
Purchase your alarm and have it installed professionally.,
Contact insurance company for possible rate reductions.",How to Shop for an Alarm System for Your Truck," Your dealer will be able to inform you about the types of alarm systems that come standard on specific trucks. If you want to purchase an after-market alarm system, you should not hesitate because of extraneous issues, such as a fear of violating a manufacturer's warranty. Due to federal law, it is not legal to void a warranty due to the installation of an alarm system unless the manufacturer supplies the truck with an alarm for free.;
, One of the best ways to get information on alarms is directly from the police. They deal with auto theft on a daily basis and can inform you of why certain alarms work for frequently than others.

, There are several different types of alarms that work in their own unique ways. Independent alarms simply sound off a siren or horn when breached, while other more complex alarms interact with police to a great extent, even going so far as to give authorities GPS locations of the stolen vehicle.

, Radar Sensors can create a field around your truck, detecting any movement around the entire vehicle and sound an alarm in the event of any unwarranted activities. Audio Sensor alarms detect specific frequencies of breaking glass and sound a horn or alarm when detected, which saves valuable items inside your truck in the event of a smash and grab.

, Many alarm systems will have reviews on the internet. Make note of which companies have the most positive reviews, and which models of alarms have received the most praise.

, This is a crucial aspect of owning an alarm. Do not install the alarm yourself unless you are a qualified professional with extensive experience working with alarms and the electrical system of your truck. If installed incorrectly, your alarm could malfunction, either sounding off when there is no present danger, or worse, failing to sound when needed.

, Just as automotive insurance companies offer rate reductions for defensive driving courses, many offer reductions for the addition of an aftermarket alarm.

Use the key to lock and unlock the driver’s side door.,
Use the key fob to lock and unlock the door.,
Make sure you haven’t hit the panic button.,
Start the car.,
Read the owner’s manual.",How to Shut Off a Car Alarm That Won't Quit1," Many factory car alarms are designed to turn off when in proximity to the appropriate key or key fob. You may be able to shut your car alarm down simply by inserting your key into the lock on the driver’s side door, locking it, and unlocking it again. Because the car is being unlocked by the appropriate key, it may send a signal to the alarm that it can shut down.While the passenger side door may work, it is more likely it will work on the driver’s side.
If the door is already locked, simply unlock it. If the alarm doesn’t stop, try locking it an unlocking it again.;
, Using a similar methodology to the key method, unlocking the vehicle’s doors with the key fob will also shut down many factory car alarms. When standing close enough to the vehicle for your key fob to reach, press the lock button followed by the unlock button. Many car alarms will shut down when the car doors are unlocked by the keys or appropriate key fob. If the door locks do not respond, the batteries may be dead in the key fob. Replace the batteries and try again.
If the doors unlock and the alarm continues to go off, your vehicle may need to be repaired by a professional.

, Most key fobs have an orange or yellow button on them commonly referred to as a “panic button.” This button activates something very similar to a car alarm. The horn will honk and the lights will flash. If you accidentally hit the panic button, it may continue until you press the button again. In some cars, you may be able to shut down the panic mode by starting the car and driving it.Most panic alarms will shut off on their own after a certain amount of time.
The panic alarm may not shut off when you start the car, but will if you begin to drive.

, Your alarm is designed to prevent your vehicle from being stolen by someone without a key, so starting the car with the ignition key is often sufficient to power down your car alarm. Unlock the door and enter your vehicle. Insert the key and turn it to “ACC” (accessories). If the alarm persists, attempt to start the car. Remember that some aftermarket alarms may not allow you to start the car with the alarm sounding, even with the key.Turning the key in the ignition should reset the alarm, but that may not always be the case.

, Standing next to a car with a blaring alarm may not strike you as the best time to do some light reading, but your vehicle’s owner’s manual can likely provide you with important information about shutting off your car alarm. If you are unable to shut the alarm off with your keys or key fob, check the owner’s manual for instructions on what to do.Every auto maker uses different car alarms, so some may require a specific action be taken before the alarm will shut down.
You may need to repeat an action a certain number of times to reset the computer, such as locking and unlocking the door.

Locate the appropriate fuse box.,
Identify the fuse for the car alarm.,
Remove the fuse with pliers.,
Replace the fuse and see if it starts again.",How to Shut Off a Car Alarm That Won't Quit2," Most modern vehicles have more than one fuse box located throughout the vehicle for various electronic components. Use the vehicle’s owner’s manual to identify the box with the fuse powering your factory car alarm. The fuse box may be located in the engine bay or the cabin of the car. If it is located in the cabin, you may need to remove some trim pieces to be able to access it.Be careful when removing plastic trim pieces of your interior, as they may be brittle and prone to breaking.
Place trim pieces off to the side to ensure you don’t step or sit on them as you work.

, Many fuse boxes will have a diagram on the underside of the fuse box cover. If there isn’t one there, check in the vehicle’s owner’s manual as well. Identify the fuse in the diagram that powers the car alarm, then locate its corresponding fuse in your vehicle. If you do not have a diagram on the cover or in the manual, you will need to utilize the “guess and check” method of locating the fuse for the alarm in the next step.You may be able to locate a diagram of your fuse box online if you don’t have one available to you.
The fuse box diagram will be in your vehicle’s repair manual if you have one.

, Once you have located the correct fuse, use a pair of needle nose pliers or plastic tweezers designed to remove automotive fuses to pull the fuse out of its location in the fuse box. The alarm should power down immediately with the fuse removed. If you were unable to identify which was the correct fuse using a diagram, remove and replace fuses one at a time until you remove the one that makes the alarm stop.The alarm will shut off immediately when you remove the correct fuse.
Some aftermarket car alarms may not have a fuse in the fuse box.

, Use the pliers or tweezers to slide the fuse back into place once the alarm has shut off. The alarm should be reset and should not turn back on once the fuse has been reinserted into the fuse box. If the alarm reactivates as you slide the fuse back into place, it means the alarm is not functioning properly.If the alarm comes back on, you will likely need to take the vehicle to be repaired by a professional.
If the alarm comes back on a few minutes after you reinsert the fuse, something must be setting it off, such as a faulty key fob or an issue with the electronic control unit of the vehicle.

Put on the appropriate safety gear.,
Locate the battery.,
Disconnect the ground wire from the negative terminal.,
Disconnect any alarm backup batteries.,
Wait for the computer to reset.,
Reconnect the battery.",How to Shut Off a Car Alarm That Won't Quit3," Before doing any work on your vehicle, you should always make sure to put on the appropriate safety gear. Because there is a risk of sparks when working with an automotive battery, wear safety glasses or another form of eye protection before attempting to disconnect it. You may also want to wear gloves to protect your hands from the heat of the engine bay as well as from pinches and cuts.Always wear eye protection when working on your vehicle, especially when dealing with electrical components.
Gloves can protect your hands from pinches, scrapes and the heat of the engine bay.

, You can usually find the battery for your vehicle under the hood in the engine compartment, but some automakers opt to put their batteries in the trunk to save space or improve weight distribution. When a battery is in the trunk of a vehicle, it is often under a carpeted piece of wood separating it from the trunk compartment and may be located alongside your spare tire.If you are having difficult locating your battery, refer to your owner’s manual to help you find it.
There may be a protective cover over your battery in the engine bay that you may need to remove in order to find it.

, You can identify the negative terminal by following the thick black cable connecting it to the body of the car or by looking for the letters “NEG” or the symbol (-) above one of the two battery terminals. Using a wrench or pair of pliers, loosen the nut holding the black ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery. You will not need to remove the nut completely, just loosen it enough to be able to slide the cable off of the terminal. The alarm, as well as everything else electronic in the vehicle, should shut off immediately.Tuck the ground cable alongside the battery to ensure it can’t accidentally come back into contact with the negative terminal.
You will not need to remove the positive cable from the battery.

, Some aftermarket car alarms come equipped with a small backup battery that will keep the alarm functioning after the battery for your car has been disconnected. These batteries are not designed to power the alarm, horns and lights for long. Their primary role is to keep the alarm in working condition while you work on your vehicle so you don’t have to reset anything when reconnecting your primary vehicle battery. Refer to the user manual for the alarm system, or owner’s manual for the vehicle for factory installed backup batteries, to locate and disconnect the backup battery as well.Most factory alarms do not come equipped with a backup battery.
If you are unable to locate the backup battery, it will eventually die if disconnected from the primary battery for too long.

, Depending on the vehicle, the amount of time required for the computer to reset can vary widely. You may want to leave the vehicle disconnected for up to an hour to ensure the alarm and the vehicle’s ECU (Electronic Control Unit) have both been forced to reset due to a lack of power. Forcing your vehicle’s computer to reset will also result in losing your radio station pre-sets and having to reset the clock in your vehicle.

, After waiting an hour or so, reconnect the ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery. Tighten the nut that secures the cable to the terminal and check it to make sure it can’t jiggle loose. If the cable were to become disconnected while you were driving, it would shut the car off. The alarm should not go off when you reconnect the battery. If it does, you will need to have your vehicle repaired by a professional.Ensure the battery cables are secure and replace any covers you may have removed to gain access to the battery.
Start the car to make sure there are no further issues.

, Lock your car electronically using the remote, if you have one. Push down the locking pin on the door manually if the remote does not engage the lock or if you don't have a remote. Use your remote key or click the ""lock"" button on the driver's side door to engage the lock. If this does not work:


Disconnect the negative battery terminal.
Turn the key to on position.
Reattach the negative battery terminal.
Turn the key to off position.
Start the car., Your alarm sensors are poorly calibrated. You'll need to adjust them so that they do not continue to cause problems whenever a dog brushes up against the car. To do so, refer to your owner's manual under the heading ""Alarm System."" Most cars can be re-calibrated to be less sensitive without going into the shop. There are two types of alarm sensor controls:



DIP Switches: These are a series of toggles that control how much electricity runs through the sensors. Turning a few off will make your alarm system less touchy. These are built into the main control unit of the alarm system.

Rheostat: Using a small screwdriver, you can loosen up a bolt that adjusts the resistance in the sensor, making it more or less sensitive. These sensors are mounted externally., When a car refuses to start, most people go through a series of checks to find the issue. After all the checks lead to no solution, consider checking the car alarm. Some alarms are wired with the ignition as an anti-theft measure. Attempt to disable or reset the alarm, and then try starting your car."
"
Identify your valet switch.,
Turn the ignition key to the on position.,
Toggle the switch or push the button.",How to Reset Aftermarket (Checkmate) Car Alarm1," The valet switch is either a toggle switch or a push button that disarms all alarm functions except the remote panic and remote door lock functions. This eliminates the need to hand your remote to garage mechanics and valets, giving the switch its name.Usually this switch is located somewhere under the dash, perhaps on the left kick panel.A valet switch is a standard piece of equipment with most factory and aftermarket alarm systems.
Using the valet switch should serve to reset your alarm.
Your alarm should stay shut down as long as you are in valet mode. You should be aware that this disables you alarm system, meaning that your car is unprotected if you use it as a long term solution.;
, It is not necessary to start the car. As a matter of fact, you may find that you cannot start the car if you try., This will activate the valet bypass. The alarm should now be disabled."
"
Locate the battery.,
Disconnect the battery ground cable.,
Lock all doors manually.,
Open the hood.,
Find the hood position detection switch.,
Reconnect the battery ground cable.",How to Reset Aftermarket (Checkmate) Car Alarm2," Usually the battery is located under the hood or in the trunk. Occasionally it can be found other places, such as under a rear seat.

, This will cut power to the entire car. The ground is the cable connected to the negative battery terminal and is usually black.

, Lock all passenger doors from inside the vehicle and the driver's door from outside with the key (you won’t be able to use the remote).

, This is only necessary if the battery is under your hood.

, You must hold this down when you connect the battery. Note that your alarm may not be equipped with a hood position detector. The detector looks like a plunger switch pointing upward. It will be pressed down when hood is closed, telling your alarm that nobody has tampered with the hood. The plunger will usually be enclosed within a rubber boot.


If your battery is not under your hood, it is not necessary to have the hood open and manually depress the hood position detector. You can simply close the hood.

, This will restore power to the vehicle with all doors locked, trunk locked, and the hood position switch held down. Having everything closed and locked up will signal to your alarm that no intrusions have taken place, and this should reset your alarm.


If all is well the horn will be silent, and the headlights will stop flashing.
The car is ready to start.

"
"
Sit in your driver’s seat.,
Wait for the alarm to reset.,
Turn the key to the “on” position.",How to Reset Aftermarket (Checkmate) Car Alarm3," Be patient and the alarm will reset itself.

, Once the alarm resets it will still be armed, but will not be activated.

, This will disarm your alarm, effectively resetting it.

Visit a dealer.,
Take a minute and think about which specific car alarm features would be useful to you.,
Decide how much you are willing to spend on your car combo alarm system.,
Determine whether you want a DIY car combo alarm system you can install yourself, or one that you need a professional to install.

,
Go online, or read car magazines, to research which brands of combo alarm systems offer the features you want.

,
List down your top choices for car combo alarm systems.

,
Check how other car owners rate each of your chosen alarm systems by reading reviews on customer review sites.

,
Choose a combo alarm system for a car that offers all the features you want and that fits your budget.

,
Buy your car combo alarm system.

",How to Choose a Combo Alarm System for a Car," Ask if your car dealership can recommend a car combo alarm system. As a professional, your car dealer will most likely know which types of alarm systems are available for your car and which are most compatible.;
, Though all combo alarm systems for cars combine a number of features, each system offers different a combination. It's a matter of preference which one works best for you.


Find out about combo alarm systems for cars with remote start and keyless entry. These systems, which are offered more and more frequently as separate trim levels on vehicles, allow you to open and start your car with your remote and eliminate the need for keys.
Research which brands of door contact sensors and glass break sensors work best for cars. When the alarm system is activated, these sensors detect shattering glass or opening doors.
Decide whether passive arming is a useful feature for you. Passive arming automatically activates your car combo alarm system between 15 and 20 seconds after you've parked your car.
Look into 2-way communication systems that alert you immediately if your car starts. Most types offer a flashing LED light on your remote that warns you so you can take the necessary steps to stop your car from being stolen and alert the authorities.

, Remember that the more features you want, the higher the price. Of course, this also results in better protection of your car.

Devise an installation plan.,
Check each of your doors.,
Consult a service manual to find wiring diagrams.,
Remove the necessary panels.,
Mount the car alarm.,
Drill through the firewall.,
Run a wire through the firewall.,
Mount the siren.,
Run the valet switch.,
Run the LED light.,
Run the external antenna.,
Connect the siren.,
Connect the alarm sensors.,
Hook up the power wire.,
Replace the panels on your vehicle.",How to Install a Car Alarm," Planning ahead can shave hours off your installation time. In particular, gather documents and manuals outlining your car's wiring colors, locations, and polarities., You want to make sure that they trigger the ""door ajar"" indicator on the dashboard. If a door fails to trigger, then the alarm will not go off when that door is tampered with. If a door doesn't trigger the alarm, then your alarm will not be effective.


Most alarms come with optional pin switches that trigger the alarm when the door opens. These can be a good alternative if your doors are not triggering the door ajar/dome light when opened., Make note of which panels will need to be removed and which tools you will need to remove them. Learn the wiring layout of your vehicle and sketch a plan for where you will connect your car alarm.

, This will allow you to access the wires needed to hook up your car alarm. It will also give you access to places under the dash that you can mount the alarm if you choose. Typically this will include panels near the center of the dash on the driver’s side. They are often located near the floor or underneath the steering wheel.These panels will be different for each car, but you can refer to your car’s service manual to find the correct panels.

, Try to install the car alarm in a hidden place. Some people will mount it inside the dash if there is room, or under a seat. Just keep in mind that if the alarm is visible, a thief could tamper with it. The harder it is to find your alarm, the more effective it will be.Install the mount with screws and accessories provided with the car alarm.


Be sure to look on the other side of any surface before running a screw through. You do not want to accidentally screw into wires or other parts.

, You can avoid this step if you run a wire from the car alarm to the siren through an already existing hole in the firewall. It often works well to run the wire alongside the heater core hoses, an amp power wire, ignition power source, or any other lead going to the other side of the firewall. If there are none conveniently located, you will have to make one. If you have to make a new hole, be sure to look on both sides of the firewall to ensure that the spot you’d like to drill is safe. As long as the drill will not hit any other parts, it should be fine to drill there.

, This wire will connect the car alarm to the siren.


It is important that you insulate this wire with a rubber boot or fill the hole with silicon. This keeps the wire from being damaged by friction with the firewall and shorting out. You should also aim to put the wire somewhere that it will not be kicked or tugged by yourself or your passengers for the same reasons., You can choose a place on the firewall or somewhere else in the engine bay that has enough room. It is important to mount the siren face down to prevent water from accumulating in the voice coil., This will be a wire off of the car alarm module. This switch will allow you to disable the alarm features while it is engaged. This will make it easier when someone else has your car, like when you leave it with mechanic.

, The car alarm LED light indicates when the alarm is armed. This light is usually mounted on the dash by drilling a small hole in the dash and running the wire to the car alarm module. The light is then mounted on the dash with superglue to keep it in place.Be sure to look on both sides of the dash panel that and be sure that your drill will not hit any other parts. There is no need to take the dash off for this step as long as you can find a safe place to make your hole.

, If you have an external antenna, it extends the range of your wireless remote or keypad by receiving the signal from outside the car and transmitting it to the car alarm module. Most external antennas are glass mount antennas. This means that you will mount a receiver on the outside of your glass and a repeater on the inside of the same glass. The signal will be transmitted through the glass with no need to drill holes and the repeater wires directly to the antenna wire of your alarm module.

, The siren should have two wires, one negative and one positive. Most car alarms output a positive siren, so connect the alarm unit to the positive wire of the siren and connect the other siren wire to a ground., The sensors are responsible for signalling that something is amiss and the siren should sound. You will connect the sensor wires from the car alarm to the wires that signal your door ajar or dome lights.You can also connect them to the trunk and hood position sensors and the ignition switch depending on the features available with your alarm system.


It is recommended that you crimp these connections and do not simply twist them or use a wire nut., You should hook the power wire of your alarm module to the batter or other constant power source. This will ensure the alarm is powered even when the car is turned off. Your alarm is now powered up and active.

, Be sure to replace them in the correct order so that all of the panels fit together properly. It is a good idea to consult your service manual for this step as well.

Decide what kind of boat you want.,
Spend about a week looking and comparing prices on used boats you like.,
Once you have found what you think is a reasonable price, for a boat you feel suits your needs, call the owner or talk to the dealer.,
If, after all these questions, you are still interested, make an appointment to see the boat, and let him know you want to take it out on the water.,
When you look at the boat, note any fixed hull cracks, see if any parts look newer than others, and look for signs of neglect.,
Find out why the boat is being sold.",How to Buy a Used Boat," Answering these questions will help you find that out: do you want a fibreglass or aluminum hull; inboard engine or outboard; what length; is there a type or brand of engine you would prefer, and how powerful, in horsepower, do you need it to be? Do you want a hardtop cover, canvas, or none? One of the best ways to answer these questions is to know what you are going to be doing with it. Will you be on a lake, a river, or ocean? Is it for fishing, hunting, cruising, skiing, or racing?;
, This is to get a feel for the market. See what is selling and what isn't in your community.

, Don't say you want to buy the boat. Simply call to ask them some simple questions. Write the questions and answers down on paper. Here are some simple questions:


Find out the year and make of engine and boat hull. If the difference between the two is more than three years, chances are the engine has been replaced.
Ask if they are the original owner, if it has been in salt water, when was it last used, how was it stored in the winter, and if it has had any major or minor problems fixed (new wiring, crack in hull, replaced engine head) or still existing. If you are talking to the owner, pay attention to their tone. If they seem nervous, in a hurry, or annoyed, they may be hiding something. One of the most important questions you need answered is why they are selling. This, more than anything else, can affect how much you offer.

, If you don't want to do that, you can also hook up a water hose to the engine to check if it works properly. Either way if he or she tells you they don't have time; walk away. Do not waste your time.

, Neglect in one area, such as the hull or upholstery, may mean neglect in other areas, such as the engine. Depending on what you are looking to spend, and what you are capable of repairing on your own, this may be a good or bad thing. If there seems to be any major inconsistency between what they said on the phone and what you see, walk away. If they refuse to take it out on the water after they said they would, no matter the deal, walk away. Now is a good time to find out how many hours are on the engine.

, Assuming everything runs great, this is where the 'why' he is selling it comes into play. Is he moving? Maybe you can offer him less. Is he paying off a debt? He may accept a lower offer. Does he have a better boat or want to buy a better boat? Then he'll probably hold out for a better price. Every defect you identify works to your advantage in getting a better price. Try offering cash (it looks sexier than a cashier's check) for less than you think it's worth based on these questions and on its local market value. At very least, don't pay more than you think it's worth; there will always be another deal, so you need not worry, especial as summer turns to fall.

Take an expert with you.,
Figure out what kind of boat you want to own before you go shopping.,
If you are new to sailing, look for a boat that is basically ready to sail away.,
If you are interested in racing a sailboat, always hook up with local sailboat racers before you buy a boat.",How to Buy a Used Sailboat1," Some of the faults of a sailboat can look awful but are easy to repair while other faults are hidden and expensive. For a beginner, it's really hard to spot the difference. Hire a professional surveyor. You'll need a survey done for insurance purposes anyway. It will be money well-spent, especially if the boat is an expensive one.;
, If you go looking at boats without a clear idea of what kind of boat you want to sail, you may fall in love with a boat that won't meet your needs. Think: Do you want to race? Then, buy the kind of boat people in your area are racing. Do you want to trailer it to distant cruising grounds? Then, restrict your search to smaller boats with trailers. Do you want performance or a big fat cabin? If you don't know the answers, you risk wasting your money.

, Learning to sail involves lots and lots of sailing. Fixing up a junker boat can take months or years and won't teach you a thing about sailing.

, There is all sorts of obscure knowledge about racing boats that you will be helpless without.

"
Stick with fiberglass construction if you're a beginner -- most wooden boats require a good deal more maintenance and care, and damage and rot in wooden boats can be hard to find without a massive tear down and/or lots of professional experience.

,
Check for: boat pox (blisters on the bottom); spongy deck; leaking chain plates; water running down the inside from the hull-deck joint; severe cracks around deck fittings and mast step; fittings pulling out of the deck; large gel coat gouges below the waterline; cracks along the top of keel; wobbly rudder; wobbly drive shaft.,
If the gel coat looks dull or faded, make sure it just needs a polish and not a new paint job.

,
Don't like fiberglass?",How to Buy a Used Sailboat2,", These are all potentially expensive fixes.

,, Steel is generally unbreakable but watch out for serious rust. Concrete? Walk away unless you built it yourself.

"
"
In cabin sailboats, much more damage involves leakage of rainwater from above than seawater from below.,
Leaking decks can lead to very expensive damage to the deck itself and to bulkheads below.,
Water damage and rot in the interior bulkheads and woodwork may cause more than cosmetic damage.",How to Buy a Used Sailboat3," Check for signs of leaking decks and cabin tops, such as streaks, stains and mildew inside the cabin. Watch for gobs of sealant around the port lights (windows), which is a sign that somebody has been chasing down leaks.

, Many fiberglass boats have decks with plywood or balsa wood core material. If water has leaked in around improperly sealed deck fittings, the plywood or balsa wood core of the deck may have de-laminated and rotted. If you find spots or areas of the deck that are mushy in the least, run away. This is a huge pain to fix.

, In some boats, the chain plates (attachments for the rigging that holds up the mast) are attached to plywood bulkheads inside the cabin. In some boats, the interior woodwork holds up a deck-stepped mast. If such structural woodwork is water damaged, rotted, or otherwise unsound, be alarmed.

"
"
Steer clear of rare or very old engines unless you're certain there's an adequate supply of parts.

,
Do the Smoke Test: healthy diesels make small amounts of black smoke with some white on cold starts.,
Check for fuel leaks and a working bilge blower in gasoline engines.,
Before the seller cranks the engine, check to see if it is already warm.",How to Buy a Used Sailboat4,", Sick ones make blue or continuous white. Diesels are generally robust but require a strict schedule of oil changes. Bonus points for proof of maintenance.

, Again, bonus points for maintenance records and a spare parts kit. Common ailments of gas engines: wet or worn-out electric components, bad points and plugs.

, If the seller took the trouble to warm up the engine before showing you the boat, it may be because it is hard to start the engine when it is cold.

"
"
Take all of the sails out of their bags and spread them out.,
Rigging will show the general quality of the boat's maintenance.,
If possible, hoist all the sails and work all the halyards, sheets, winches and furlers.

",How to Buy a Used Sailboat5," Look for chafing, repairs, stretches, pulled-out stitches and broken slides. Mildew is harmless but tough to get rid of. Check spinnakers for excessive bagginess. Hoist the windward sails and check for excessive draft and stretch. Remember that replacing the sails can cost you half the price of an old sailboat.

, You can pretty much count on replacing a lot of rigging on any old boat, though. Check for worn pins and shackles, unraveling wire, broken blocks, worn-out lines. These items are relatively easy to fix and replace, however. Winches should work smoothly, but if they don't, you can almost always get them running right with a quick cleaning and greasing.

,"
"
Check the wiring -- it's commonly done by people who have no clue about what they're doing.,
Check sea cocks.,
Look for leaks around portholes and hatches.

,
Work the engine controls; cables and linkages should move smoothly.,
Check spreader and mast lights.,
Dodgers and other canvas get bonus points for being made from high quality, high performance outdoor fabric (like Sunbrella®) and having clean, clear plastic windows.

,
Make sure safety equipment complies with government regulations and in good condition.,
Ensure that the bilge doesn't smell like a bilge!

",How to Buy a Used Sailboat6," If you have no clue, then get an expert.

, Beware if they're seized open.

,, If possible, do a battery load test.

, Listen for wires banging around inside the mast -- a sure way to lose a night's sleep.

,, In the galley, the propane should be installed properly. Propane, which is heavier than air, will accumulate in the bilge from leaking propane connections and is very difficult to remove.

Become familiar with performance boats.,
Determine how large of a boat you need.,
Look at the deck layout of different boat models.,
Compare Vee bottom vs Deck Boat.,
Look at engines and drives.,
Look at what to do to check out your potential used performance boat?,
How to know if you're paying the right price?,
Be prepared for wheeling and dealing.,
Be respectful to the sellers you will get much more from them.",How to Buy a Used Performance Boat," Go out with friends, rent a boat, do whatever it takes to educate yourself with the different types, sizes and styles.;
, Get to know your local boating locations and find out if they have any size restrictions. Then look for the size boat based on what you plan to do with your boat and where you'll be doing it. The larger the lake, the more turbulent the water conditions will be. Bigger boats make larger wakes. Combine that with wind conditions and you can be in for a rough ride. Bigger is not always better. If your interest is a smooth ride, a larger boat will do well. If your interest is wake boarding skiing and so on, a smaller boat may suit you better. Generally in the local lakes the size would be between 21 and 27 feet.

, Cuddy cabin vs walkthrough. Normally the 21 to 23 boats are walkthrough bow riders and the 24 and above are cuddy cabin crawl through bow riders. This is a matter of suiting your needs most people think they will use the cuddy area and do not because its not the most comfortable place to be on a hot day, but it is a personal choice.

, So far we have been talking about V bottom boats. The Deck Boat is gaining momentum in the performance boating arena. Deck Boats are usually 26' in length to about 29 but usually around 28'. You will find that the deck boat will give you the smoothest ride in choppy water. Compared to a V bottom in its size range. The Deck Boat will also give you the roomiest floor plan combined with more storage. This does not mean the deck boat is aways the best way to go. The turning radius as well as the handling on a turn is not in any way comparable to a v bottom's tight responsiveness. The twin sponson is the reason for the smooth ride as well as the inferior handling. Remember this, one boat is not better than another; just better for a specified purpose.

, In purchasing a used performance boat it is not common to have a boat that is underpowered. Usually the performance market does not run V6 engines or 4 cylinders on these boats. Performance boats are usually over-powered. The question is what motor is best for the size boat your buying. A 21' to 23' boat will usually do fine with a 350 Mag Mercruiser Bravo 1 drive. Mercruiser is almost the only power plant used in the Southern California Performance Boat market. With a 24' boat to 29' boat you should expect a 496 or an 8.2 with a Bravo 1 drive. You may see a Bravo 3 drive (dual prop configuration). High performance motors may be impressive in speed runs but usually have a bit more mechanical risks do to harder run times and potentially added service demands.

, First look at the boat; you can almost always tell if the owner is meticulous with their boat or not. Look at the gelcoat and see if there are scratches are all over. Look on the bottom to see if they beached it all the time. Look at the color of the gelcoat to see fading as it may have been kept out in the sun. Feel the vinyl for hardening and discoloration. Spring on the floor to feel a spongy softness which reveals water damage in the wood of the floor. If it's a fiberglass floor, the spring may be normal. Grab the drive and attempt to move it side to side, looking for play in the drive (make sure the steering wheel is not moving. Play is a bad thing, and the gimbal bearing could be costly to replace. Now as for the motor try to get records of the periodic maintenance, preferably once a year by a dealer not by the owner. Some boat owners do their own oil changes and assume they serviced the boat. Many times this results in costly repairs. Validate the stated hours with the hour meter and a computer diagnosis tool. You would need a Mercruiser mechanic for this. Remember the motor's computer has the actual running hours of the boat and is not easy to tamper with. An hour meter can be replaced anytime along the way. If possible run a compression test on the motor if your interested it would be money well spent. Prop damage speaks for itself. Do not let a dented prop run for long it will create further damage to the drive.

, You've heard of the phrase ""knowledge is power""? In purchasing a used performance boat this is an understatement. Check the local used boat market to see if the boat you want is in your price range. You may be forced to step up price wise or step down on your desired boat. Do not go for the cheapest boat, you will pay for that mistake in the long run. Remember you are buying a boat not a car or a house. You do not need a performance boat, you want one. Enjoy yourself, it could be educational and fun. If you find yourself considering a boat that you are not really happy with in an attempt to fit your budget, you may want to hold off and scrape up a few more dollars. Some people advise you to ""stand by your price without budging, walk away if they don't give you what you want."" It just doesn't work like that, the conditions and opportunities command you to be more fluid. You must be ready to maneuver to pay more than you had originally assumed because you are not an expert. You need to learn the market by seeing what X amount will get you. Don't be afraid to raise your original budget. DO NOT BUY SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE BECAUSE IT FITS YOUR BUDGET. If you can't afford it then wait till you can. Limit your shopping to a few months or you will become a career shopper achieving nothing in the long run. You may have heard ""a boat is a hole in the water in which you pour your money into"". This occurs when people try to steal a boat and the laugh ends up being on them. Also when boat owners attempt to cut corners on services they find themselves paying for drive replacements. If you can't afford to own, store, and maintain your boat then don't buy one maybe golf is your thing.

, It is important to be considerate to those selling the boat. Price and value should be known before seeing the boat. You may not have the bottom line but don't just call people up and throw a ridiculous and insulting offer just to appear shrewd, this will expose your apparent ignorance. Know the value, know a good deal. If the boat looks great and the owner seems honest and took good care of his boat then don't be afraid to tell him so. No one likes doing business with someone that is griping about the condition of the boat to get a better deal. This will only cause a distance between the two of you pushing the seller away. If the boat is at a fair price and you like it then do not lie and say ""this is all I have"". Again no one likes a sleazy sales person and no one likes a sleazy buyer. Offer the seller a lower price and back it up by telling them about other boats that put his price out of the market price. If the boat is a sweet deal then buy it. More people lose great deals getting caught up in the game. If you love it but it happens to be a bit more than you wanted to pay then it may benefit you to move your price to fit your needs. Many times buyers are informed to move their needs to fit their price. In some ways it may be necessary but remember, your boat is solely about your enjoyment. If you're walking out on a great boat over a few dollars, then something went wrong in your negotiation. DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR OBJECTIVE, YOUR BUYING A BOAT NOT WINNING A NEGOTIATION WAR. Your ego may need to take a back seat for a moment.

, There are a lot of great people (sellers) that will help you more than you know. if you just lose those boxing gloves and just talk. Bonding with the seller will inspire them to give you useful hints. If the seller is getting out of boating, they may be inspired to give you some or all of the boating toys and accessories that will just be taking up space in their garage. Some people may let you test drive the boat, some may not. Do not pass up a boat for this reason if you know the boat, which you should, if you did your homework. Then check out the motor and other criteria and be sure to run the motor before you buy. Do not ask to run the motor unless you plan to buy.

Decide what you’re looking for in a fishing boat.,
Choose the type of boat you want.",How to Buy a Used Fishing Boat1," Prospective buyers have several things to consider when choosing a boat to purchase:



Size: Fishing boats come in a wide variety of sizes, from watercraft you can store in your shed to mammoth vessels that require boathouses. Be sure you select a boat you can store appropriately, and don’t overstretch your limits. A poorly stored watercraft can suffer irreparable damage in harsh weather conditions.

Cost: The larger the boat, the bigger the price tag. Most sellers will be willing to bargain, but it would be wise to come up with a maximum amount you’re willing to spend and stick to it no matter what. If you’re having trouble finding something you like in your price range, be patient and extend your search.

Purpose: Are you a casual fisherman looking for something to take out on the lake behind your cottage? Or are you a tournament angler seeking a boat that will give you that edge in the next competition? What you plan to do with your boat will go a long way in narrowing your search so you aren’t left with one fruitless visit after another.

Engine type: If you opt for a powerboat, you will need to decide how much engine power you’re looking for. Consider where you plan to use the boat and choose your engine accordingly. If your fishing hole is a small, quiet lake, you don’t need a powerboat with a lively engine.;
, There are a number of options here:



Inshore fishing boats are simple and cost-effective boats for anglers who plan to keep it simple. They’re effective in shallow water and on flat surfaces, and is known for being easy to transport and store.

Offshore fishing boats are much larger and elaborate due to their need to withstand punishing ocean waves. These boats are limited to fishing enthusiasts with plenty of money to spend; it is difficult to find used offshore fishing boats.

Jon fishing boats are flat, square boats with pointed bows that are perfect when fishing on calm, flat surfaces. They are usually made of aluminum or wood and are among the easiest boats to move.

Drift fishing boats are shaped like canoes, only with far more space in the middle. The design makes these boats the optimal choice when fishing in fast-moving water like active lakes or rivers. These boats are generally constructed out of fiberglass, wood or aluminum.

Pontoon fishing boats are the most unique of the bunch, consisting of a seated area with pontoons on either side to keep the craft afloat. These boats are great for individual anglers who don’t need a lot of extra space. They’re also affordable and easy to store.

Sport or jet fishing boats are engine-operated boats that allow users to cover great distances in a short amount of time. Sport fishing boats use engines that are blade-propelled, while jet fishing boats use water propulsion engines and are safer to use in shallow water.

Buy the boat.,
Consider adding a trolling motor.,
Figure out how you want to use your boat.,

Make sure you get the needed accessories.,
Maintain your boat.","How to Choose, Use, and Maintain an Inflatable Boat"," You have one of the toughest decisions of all ahead now: finding the right boat. You want to get a boat that's tough, especially if this is your first inflatable boat.

A good choice is a 30 gauge plus vinyl PVC or more. You can get inflatable boats in PVC or hypalon. Hypalon is more durable and lasts longer, but nothing inflatable lasts forever. PVC boats are cheaper and can be long lasting and tough, you just have take care of them.;
, Now that you have the boat, consider this on some inflatable boats, you can add trolling motors! Trolling motors come in handy for fishing and certain weather such as wind. Paddling is hard and is not fast or easy.

, Consider all the fun recreational options it provides. Fishing is optional; make sure you can cast cautiously, even thought the boat may be durable and tough, puncture resistant, etc, it still would be wise to use caution. Floating is another option, so is just jumping off and swimming!

, You know what they say ""a boat is an endless money drain"". This is true, especially on the day you get the boat, you will need paddles (if not included), life vests, an anchor, an electric/ manual air pump (if not included/owned), and rope for anchor (if not owned). This can all add up to an additional $40+.

The life vests should be nice, adjustable ones. The paddles should be classic 48""+ french oars if you want to steer the boat like a regular. you can use kayak paddles if you are experienced with paddling.
The anchor should be an 8 pound mushroom anchor. You can get spiked ones, but they are not as east to base, they get caught, etc. Mushroom anchors are also very easy and are favorites of boaters with small boats. They catch in mud and gravel easy and don't catch on plants easy.

, After use on the water, you should wash your boat inflated. This helps get rid of sand, chemicals, etc that could damage your boat. Use dish soap and a sponge and wipe the boat down. Rinse and repeat several times and let the boat dry completely before storage.

If you are storing inflated, just scrub, rinse repeat and dry off a bit and put it up!

Scour the classifieds for used boats.,
Act quickly when you find one you like.,
Establish a time to see the boat.",How to Buy a Used Fishing Boat2," Each seller has a preferred way of posting an ad. Some will use newspapers, others opt for classifieds or vehicle buy and sell magazines, and many use free online services. Search them all thoroughly, and make note of the used boats that closely fit what you’re looking for. Also be sure to note the condition as it is listed in the ad.

, Like most luxury second-hand items, a good deal on a used boat won’t last long. Take down the phone number and make the call as soon as you can. Take too long and you might miss out completely.

, Be willing to work around the seller’s schedule, but be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to inspect the boat. Leave a contact number in case the seller needs to get in touch with you prior to the visit.

Inspect the boat.,
Take the boat for a test spin.,
Work out a payment arrangement.,
Complete the transaction.",How to Buy a Used Fishing Boat3," A smaller boat shouldn’t require much time to inspect, while a larger craft could take hours. There are several trouble spots you should be mindful of as you look it over:


Making sure the boat engine is in working order if you’re purchasing a motorboat.
Checking the bilge to ensure that it isn’t full of water, which can collect during storms. The owner may include a manual or automatic bilge pump with the boat.
Ensuring that the steering and throttle are fully functional.
Having the electrical components checked to make sure they are working as they should.
Inspecting the hull and siding and looking for any wear, damage or other problems (this should be done out of water.)
Confirming that the propeller and propeller shaft work properly.
Making sure the rigging, hardware, and sails are functioning well if you’re buying a sailboat.

, Some of the above concerns may only be addressed through a trial run. Most reputable boat sellers will allow for this, as it can only enhance the odds of making a successful sale. Be sure to address each of your concerns individually. For example, check the steering by making left and right turns, or adjust the motor to different speeds to ensure that it is working properly.

, If you’re satisfied with what you see, you should either agree to pay the listed price or take your chances at negotiating for a lower one. Some sellers are firm in their valuation (and will often say so in their ads), but many are willing to at least entertain an offer. It is ultimately the seller’s decision.

, Don’t be afraid to ask for help preparing the boat for transport if you have arranged to do so yourself. The chances are promising that the seller will be in a good mood, having unloaded a major burden. Double check to make sure the boat is completely secure before leaving the premises.

Pay attention to financing deals.",How to Buy a Fishing Boat on a Budget," A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. If you are looking at a dealership, they will come in for the kill when they detect an impetuous shopper who hasn't done his homework.;
, This is vital if you are shopping at a dealership. Use the power of the Internet to find the best price, and use that as your benchmark.

, $5 is $5 regardless if you are buying a $4000 boat or a $40,000 yacht. Be prepared and have no regrets if you walk away from the deal when the bottom line was $4005 and you stuck to your guns at $4000.

, In a buyer's market, many sellers give up trying to unload their boat by owner and turn it over to an auction house. Though they will make less on the deal, you can get a great bargain.

, In most cases, you can get a better price buying from a private seller than from a dealership. Dealerships are usually in the thousands of dollars higher than an individual trying to sell his boat out of his garage. Chances are, he tried the same dealership and they offered him an insultingly low price.

, If you have to finance your purchase, it may be better to actually buy from the dealership than from auction or private sellers. The financing from your bank might be as high as 6 percent, but you might find a dealership that is offering 0 percent financing to move some stock. This could be a better deal in the long run than a smaller principal with a higher interest rate.

Are you looking for a boat to use for water skiing, wake boarding and exciting water sports? Are you looking for a craft designed for family boating? Or a powerboat for racing? Do you want a boat for a little of everything? There is a boat that's right for you. Consult a Boat Selector tool to choose the boat that is right for you. A boat buyer guide can help you choose the ideal boat for your specific needs.;
, The size of boat you choose depends on how many people will be boating with you and where you plan on boating. Make sure you anticipate these things accurately to ensure boater safety each time you're under way. Every new boat has a National Marine Manufacturing Assoc. ""NMMA capacity plate"" that tells you how many people you can safely have on board. If your choice comes down to a question of 2–4 feet (0.6–1.2 m) in size, buy more if your budget allows. Doing this will allow you to keep your boat longer as your needs change. Choose a boat that is no more that 26-feet long if you plan on trailering your boat to different waterways and boat marinas.

, When deciding what engine you will need on your boat, it's best to consider what you will be using your boat for. Water skiers will need more power, where fishing buddies probably use less. Today's buyer can also choose from new-tech engines that are more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. It's best to compare boats with different engine sizes and consult a boat buying resource to make the best choice.

, Buying a boat doesn't have to be painful - there's a boat for every budget. Boat owners are often surprised that their dream boat cost less than they'd expected! New boats and pre-owned boats bought at a reputable dealership can be financed, so you can take advantage of monthly payments. As with cars, pre-owned boats typically cost less than a similar new model.

, You will gain insight into which type of boat is best for you and the market price. You can then do a boat comparison on similar pre-owned models. With this information, you can zero in on your perfect boat!

, The best time to buy is when you are ready! You can find a great deal on a boat at any time of year. Boat shows are great places to shop - you can compare boats from a wide variety of brands and dealers, and can often take advantage of special show pricing and financing offers. Just be sure you've done some homework and identified the right type of boat for your needs before you buy.

, Boaters' education courses are available through the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadrons, Boat US, Boat-Ed and BoatSafe.

Know the terms of the sale.,
Prepare your vehicle.",How to Buy a Houseboat," A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. Consider how difficult sellers have getting rid of their houseboat; don't purchase one impetuously yourself.;
, You need to get the exact specifications of the boat and price compare. You will have a horrible taste in your mouth if you end up buying a houseboat that you could have purchased for a better price elsewhere.

, Don't limit yourself to dealerships; auction houses, private sellers, classifieds and the Internet are all excellent sources that may have that diamond in the rough at an awesome price.

, You need to have a budget and stick to it. If you want to spend $4000, then don't agree to $4005. If you are going to be mad that you let it go for only $5 more than what you wanted to spend, then you need to budget $4005 for the boat. You have to go in with a definite stopping point, otherwise, you will get caught in a pricing war and in such a situation, it is very easy to let your emotions, rather than your wallet dictate. That is dangerous. The ground is even more treacherous if you find your houseboat at auction and get caught up in an emotionally charged bidding war. You can't win in that situation.

, Unless you walk around with a bag full of money, you will need to know beforehand how much down seller or dealer requires. If you need or plan on financing your purchase, you will need to have this taken care before the sale. Auction houses do not generally offer financing or broker such deals, and private sellers most likely do not.

, Auction house terms not only define the purchase price and security deposits; they also dictate when the property must be removed. If this is an estate auction, it is usually the same day or within hours. Dealerships may allow more time; private sellers may or may not. Houseboats are considerably heavier than other boats and will require some serious muscle behind them. Based upon the size of the houseboat, you may have to arrange for specialized, professional transport.

Be sure to allow for general maintenance, storage, insurance and other important add-on products you may require such as extended warranties.;
, When buying boats, we recommend shopping new first even if you’re on a tight budget, for a number of reasons:


You’ll see the most current technology, latest design and naval architecture






Electronics will be state of the art with the newest software






New mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems(M.E.P)







,, Visit a local boat show. Take a look at all available options and board as many boats as you can.

, Here are a few of the advantages of financing your purchase through your dealer with a National Marine Bankers Association marine lending specialist (www.marinebankers.org):


Competitive rates - Interest rates for boat loans continue to trend near historic lows in the US.






Faster credit decisions—because you are working with lenders in the marine industry who lenders understand boats and their buyers. You can apply for a loan this morning and be boating this afternoon.






More electronics and extras—marine lending specialists will allow you to finance optional equipment, electronics, extended service plans and life/disability insurance coverage with your purchase.






Financing your boat purchase usually means you can afford a newer, larger or more powerful boat, a better trailer and all the gear that it takes to make boating safer and more enjoyable!






Federal income tax deductions—If a boat qualifies as a residence for purposes of deducting interest expenses on a residence* a taxpayer can deduct any qualified interest for the tax year.

If you plan on hanging out at the lake, a pontoon boat is a good idea.
If you will use your boat for water sports, a water ski or wake board boat is best.
If you plan to go sailing, a sail boat is best.
If you are a first time buyer, a boat between 22-24 feet is best. Larger boats are more expensive and more difficult to operate.;
, In addition to knowing the activities you would like to use your boat for, you need to think about other lifestyle factors that will affect your purchase. These factors will influence the size of the boat you purchase, your budget for buying a boat, and other costs that will be associated with owning a boat. Ask yourself some of these questions:Will you be the only person using the boat? Will you need space for your family and friends?
How much can you spend on a boat and related expenses (e.g.maintenance, insurance, registration fees, safety courses, storage etc.)?
Will you use your boat in lakes, rivers, or oceans?
Will you use your boat year round or only during certain times of the year?
Where will you keep your boat (e.g. at home, marina, etc.)?

, There are pros and cons for whichever route you choose to go. A new boat will be under a warranty and is in perfect condition. A used boat will be less expensive, but you may not have a warranty or any manufacturer support. You also will not know if your used boat has been in any accidents or if it has been well maintained throughout the years.New boats are purchased through a dealer.
You can purchase a used boat through a dealer, a broker, or a private individual. If you purchase a used boat, have it inspected by a certified marine surveyor.

, Online is the best way to start your boat search. Read as much about the boats you are interested in. However, do not rely on the information provided by the boat companies. Theses companies want you to make a purchase and are not completely neutral.Visit online boat owner forums to get honest opinions about boats. Current boat owners will not be biased and can give you the pros and cons of a particular boat.
Online boat shopping allows you to compare prices, models, and take virtual tours.

, Boat shows offer a unique opportunity to meet with many boat dealers, get information about boat accessories, access to special deals, and attend special seminars. Visit the boat show website before the show to find the vendors and organizations that will be there.Take pictures and notes for each boat that you look at and ask a lot of questions.
Grab brochures and business cards so you can follow up with the contacts that you make.

, Once you have narrowed down the type of boat you want, make a list of the boats you would like to see in person. When you visit and test drive the boats, look for certain factors to help you decide. You will check these factors at the dealership and when you have an on-water test ride.You may want to take notes when you check out each boat.


Weight. Heavier boats often ride better, but require larger engines.
Beam. Boats with beams that are 8' 6 and under can be transported on a trailer without using a special permit.

Legroom and storage compartments.
Noise. Some engines are louder than others. You should never hear creaking or rattling sounds during your on-water test ride.
Visibility when you are sitting and standing.
Location of the controls and access to items that you will check on a regular basis (e.g. oil dipsticks, coolant levels, power steering fluid levels, etc.).
Inboard versus outboard engines. An outboard engine is a portable, self-contained package that can be attached to the back of a boat. On the other hand, an inboard engine is mounted inside the boat and are not portable., A good boat dealer can make your buying experience much easier. Your dealer should be knowledgeable about boats as well as the boat buying process. The dealer should also have excellent customer service skills. You should feel comfortable asking questions and never be pressured into making a quick decision.Find a dealer that is a Marin Industry Certified Dealer. These dealers have pledged to be up-to-date on the boating industry and provide excellent customer service.
You can do an online search to find a certified dealer in your state.If you are unsure if your dealer is certified, call and ask before you work with them.

, Boat dealers have finance managers on staff or have existing relationships with specific banks and lenders. Because of these existing relationships, you may be able to get special deals, extended warranties, or lower interest rates.Financing through a dealer will also make your boat purchase much easier. You can take care of the shopping and financing at one location.

, A boat broker will help you find a boat, negotiate the price, and help you complete the purchase process. A broker will have knowledge about different financing options and the different sources available to you.You can find a boat broker by visiting a boat show, reading a boat magazine, or by visiting the National Marine Lenders Association website.A broker is your advocate throughout the buying process. Your broker is looking out for your best interest and will help you get the best deal.
A broker is also a resource after you buy your boat. They can help you find insurance, repair specialists, boat safety classes, and connect you with boat owner associations.

, If you are a home owner, you can take out a second mortgage to finance your boat. This will fix your interest payments for 10 to 15 years. Speak with your mortgage lender to see if this is a good option for you.


It is best if you refinance with at least a 1% improvement in your interest rate.
The amount of money you can borrow for this loan will depend on how much equity you have in your home.

, Your local bank or credit union may also be a resource to get a loan. The existing relationship you have with the institution may help you get a better loan. The only downside is your loan officer may not be knowledgeable about marine lending.


If you do go with a local bank or credit union, check and see if they have a marine lending department. If they do, ask if they have experience with the type of boat that you are interested in financing.

, Never purchase a boat without doing a thorough inspection/survey, especially if you are buying a used boat. This may or may not be required for your boat insurance. An inspection tells you the current market value of the boat and the condition and construction of the boat. The boat should also be inspected to see if it meets the boating standards of the National Fire Protection Association, the American Boat and Yacht Council, and the US Coast Guard.Tell the surveyor that you want a full condition and value survey.
Before you use a surveyor, ask to see a copy of their resume and ask them to see a sample of an inspection report.
Use a surveyor that is a member of the National Association of Marine Surveyors or the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors. Visit the website of these associations to find a surveyor in your area., If the inspection is complete and you wish to move forward with the purchase, sign a purchase and sale contract with the seller. The contract should state the price of the boat, terms of the purchase, the closing date, and the boat that you plan to purchase. If you sign this contract before the inspection is complete, write in that the sale of the boat will only happen if you are satisfied with the results of the official boat survey.You will most likely need to pay a deposit at this time. Visit the Yacht Brokers Association of American website to find a sample contract that you may use.
If you are working with a broker or dealer they may be responsible for generating the contract.

, Once you purchase the boat, you will need to get the boat's title and register the boat. If you are purchasing a used boat, you will need to do a title transfer. You can check with the National Vessel Documentation Center to see if your boat is documented. The number is 1-800-799-8362.Boats are typically registered through your state and/or the seller's state. Check with your state's registration office to determine the specific requirements and paperwork.
Also check to see if there are any liens against the boat.
Your broker or dealer can help you with this process.

, Boat safety education prepares you to be a responsible boat owner. Some insurance policies require and/or offer discounts for completing one of these courses. Boat courses can be taken online or in person.


The Boat US Foundation offers online boat courses.The US Coast Guard also offers a variety of courses, and you can find a class in your zip code through their website.You can also obtain a boating license through some of these courses. The requirements vary by state though.Visit the United States Power Squadrons website to find out the laws and regulations in your state.

, The two types of boat insurance are ""agreed value"" and ""actual cash value."" Agreed value policies cost more upfront and do not factor in the decreasing value of the boat as it gets older. Actual cash value policies cost less upfront, but take into account the decreasing value of the boat as it ages. Your boat insurance should be specific to the type of boat that you have. For example, you would not need yacht insurance if you have purchased a sail boat. Shop around to get the best deal.Ask any current boat owners you know about their insurers and how well their claims have been handled.
You can also contact your state regulatory agency to find boat insurance.
You may also talk with a local agent that will shop for you and find a policy that fits your particular needs.

Apply a protective agent.",How to Fiberglass a Boat," Before you begin the process of applying fiberglass to your boat, you need to prepare the boat. There are several preparations to consider.

Removing extra items from the bottom of the boat. You should remove the keel, any lift stakes or rails, and anything else that should not be covered in fiberglass.



 


Repair any holes with appropriate filler. To repair a hole, cut out the damaged section, wash and apply a dewaxing solvent, grind the area with a disk sander, apply a laminate or acrylic patch to the outside of the hull with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) mold release, apply a fiberglass patch measured and cut to fit the hole. Apply resin, repeat the fiberglass/resin application process as necessary and add hardener.






Clean the hull of the boat. The hull should be clear of debris, barnacles, dust, dirt and mold.






Sand the boat. For best results, the surface should be a little rough. Too much sanding can cause rippling.





;
, After about 30 minutes, the solution should be significantly hardened and ready to apply to the hull of the boat.

, This first coat is called the seal coat. Using a foam roller, apply firm pressure and directional strokes to spread the resin as evenly as possible. Wait for the surface to no longer be tacky before doing additional work on the hull.

, Cut fiberglass cloth to the shape needed. Attach the fiberglass cloth to the hull using tape, tacks or staples.

, This coat is called the bond coat. If you have waited for a while, consider sanding the hull again. Working from one end of the hull to the other, apply the bond coat over the fiberglass cloth. Remove the material you have used to attach the fiberglass cloth to the boat before the bond coat sets up completely.

, This coat is known as the fill coat. Wait for the previous coat to set up hard. If you have waited a significant period of time, clean and sand the hull again.

, The finish coat should be smooth and even, but should also be thick enough to allow you to sand the hull evenly without damaging the cloth.

, Give the final coat enough time to dry, preferably overnight. Use lower grit paper at first and finish with a higher grit paper.

, This can be paint or another boat hull finish. Apply the protective agent according to the package directions.

Cut 8 foot (2.4 m) long 2X4 treated pine boards 7 foot (2.1 m) 9 inches (22.9 cm) long, and lay them out down the length of your pipe on 24 inch (61.0 cm) centers.

,
Nail a band across the ends of these ""joists"", using a 2X4 treated board 16 feet (4.9 m) long on each side.,
Using self-drilling, coarse thread, 2 1⁄2 inch (6.4 cm), hex-head ""tech"" screws, attach a 21 inch (53.3 cm) block of treated 2X4 laid flat between each of your joists to nail the joists to.,
Toenail, or screw the joists to these blocking.

,
Lay a 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, 16 gauge galvanized strap diagonally across the top of your deck boards from corner to corner each direction.,
Measure the deck across opposite corners and rack it until the measurements are equal at each diagonal.

,
Fasten the strapping to each joist, either by drilling the strapping and nailing with 16d (3 1/2 inch) hot dipped galvanized nails, or screwing with the tech screws used for securing your blocking.

,
Install your deck.,
Decide on whether you will need a shelter for overnight excursions.,
Consider safety.,
Launch your new boat.",How to Construct an Overnight Pontoon Boat," Come up with reasonable and practical requirements, since under building will leave you with less deck space than you need, and overbuilding will send you to Davey Jones' locker with weight and expense.;
, The first concern should be getting your ""ship"" to the ""harbor"" safely, and in one piece. This will mean having a large enough suitable trailer to haul it, and a vehicle capable of pulling it, so a very large craft might be more simply assembled on the water to begin with, if a private waterfront lot or private pond is available.

, Since the vessel must be seaworthy, the flotation is a critical factor in the design. Some scrapyards may have very large PVC water pipe, plastic drums, or even military ""drop tanks"" from surplus. The drop tanks are ideal, since they are rust resistant, and contain honeycombed baffle material which makes them extremely strong, plus they are ""aerodynamic"", which would roughly equal ""hydrodynamic"". The main thing is to find something which displaces sufficient water to give flotation and stability to your vessel.

, For this article, we will use PVC water pipe as the flotation since it may be the most readily available material, and we will discuss attaching the support framing made of 2x4 treated southern pine lumber. The example boat dimensions will be 8 feet (2.4 m) wide, and 16 feet (4.9 m) long. These dimensions are just for reference, and with a little design change, you may adjust them to fit your own needs.

, This can be done with a glued slip cap, or a no-hub band and cap assembly. These materials are quite expensive, so hopefully you will find them in a salvage yard or from surplus materials at an underground utility company. Another possibility would be to make a wooden plug and fasten it in place using epoxy and screws.

,, This is the support frame for your vessel.

, Two screws per ""blocking"" should be sufficient.

,, This is the bracing which will keep the deck ""square"" during the rest of your building process.

,,, You may use 1X4 or 1X6 treated lumber, or treated marine grade plywood. You should choose the driest, least heavy material available, since the two 12 inch (30.5 cm) PVC pipes have a total displacement of only about 1572 pounds, and this will factor in how much superstructure you will be able to build on deck. Using pressure treated yellow pine in the dimensions quoted here, you have a gross weight of approximately 600 lbs, plus the weight of your pipe pontoons. As you can see, at this point you have a maximum load weight of about 900 pounds, so this will limit the on deck construction to very light materials and minimal gear.

, This will be a critical factor in whether you decide on extra flotation or upgrading your design to a larger pontoon size, 16, or even 24 inch (61.0 cm) pipe, for example. For basic camping, a small tent can be erected on the deck, using screws or even nails in place of tent stakes.

, This step should be incorporated in every aspect of the construction and use of your boat. The idea here, is giving some thought as to who will be riding the craft. Small children, people who are not capable swimmers, and other persons who may be at risk of drowning should be a high priority of concern, and you may choose to install handrails for safety around the deck. The options here include, but are not limited to, using schedule 80 3⁄4 inch (205.1 cm) PVC pipe with glued slip joint couplings for posts and rails, using metal pipe posts with rope or cable rails, or building a wood handrail framed up from and screwed to the deck.

, If you have built near the water, you may simply jack the boat up, slide dollies under the pontoons, and slide it into the water. Otherwise, you will need to use jacks to lift it high enough to back a flat bed trailer underneath it, tie it down securely, and haul it to a launching point.

Dust off your calculator.",How to Buy a Boat From a Dealer," A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. Dealerships usually work on commissions and they try to get the most out of their inventory while trying to give you a good deal. They have the upper hand when you are an impetuous shopper who hasn't done any homework.;
, This is vital if you are shopping at a dealership. Use the power of the Internet to find the best price, and use that as your benchmark.

, If you need a second or a larger live well over a tacklebox stow-away, put on paper in that order. Dealerships will try to make a premium over the options they will keep throwing in at a slightly higher price. Stick to your guns here.

, $5 is $5 regardless if you are buying a $3000 boat or a $30,000 yacht. Be prepared and have no regrets if you walk away from the deal when the bottom line was $3005 and you stuck to your guns at $3000. Dealerships will try to work you into a slightly higher price and then get you to commit by writing down your price; only your price here is what they got you to agree to. Write down your bottom line price from home and take that to the dealership. This will keep you true to your budget.

, You can find a good deal, often a better price, outside your local area. You can use this figure as a bargaining chip; several of these figures will give you a good benchmark of the price you will likely have to pay.

, Sometimes dealers may offer cash back or better financing. You will want to make sure that you know which route is going to meet your budget criteria. Sometimes paying a little more on price for a 0 percent financing offer might be cheaper in the long run than taking a couple thousand off the price for 4 to 5 percent financing.

Finished.

",How to Build a Plywood Canoe," Put a slight slope onto each end, if you like.Put the two strips on top of one another, and drill a series of 4 holes through both, at each end. Use small cable ties to fasten them together.;
, The child can then decide what shape the canoe should be, by pushing the sides out. The wider the canoe, the more stable it will be on the water.

, Plop the ""tails"" of the cable ties on the outside of the boat.

, When the resin has dried, turn the boat over and cut off all the cable ties. Use an electric planer to tidy up the outside before using the resin and tape on the outside seams. A small deck can be added at each end, or simply a ""stick"" across between the gunwales to keep the sides apart.,,, You can complete the whole job in two to three weekends.

Choose which type of car alarm you want.,
Choose what features are right for you and your needs.,
Start shopping around at local stores.",How to Choose a Car Alarm," There are two main types of car alarms: passive alarms and active alarms.


Passive alarms will automatically be armed after the car ignition is off and all the doors are closed.
Active alarms require you to press a button to arm the system.;
, Most car alarms also act as keyless entry units, where you can lock and unlock the car via the alarm remote. However, alarms also have other features you can choose from that may interest you and your needs.


Automatic rearm will re-lock your doors if you do not open them after pressing the unlock or disarm button on the remote. This feature is helpful if you accidentally unlock or disarm the car, or if you forget you unlocked the car.
Ignition controlled door locks will automatically lock your doors when the ignition is turned on, and will unlock them when the ignition is off and the key is taken out. This feature can usually be programmed to be used in different combinations.
Trunk output will automatically open the trunk when a button is pressed. This is helpful if you are doing heavy shopping or you transport bulky things a lot. You can get your trunk open without having to put anything down.
Car finder mode can help if you cannot find your car in a parking lot easily. Press the button and a siren will chirp continuously and the parking lights will flash, which is helpful for those who tend to forget where they parked the car.

,


Look for those that carry alarms with the features you are interested in so you talk to someone with more expertise in car alarms.
Look at and compare the brands that they carry. You can also compare prices between a few stores.
Be sure to ask about manufacturer warranties and store warranties.

Decide which body of water you will be using the boat on.,
Buy plans from a reputable boat designer.,
Buy quality materials.,
Use marine grade plywood (fir, meranti, okoume).,
Use a quality Epoxy Resin.,
Learn how to lay fiberglass cloth.,
Give your boat a nice finish.,
Use your boat...a lot!
",How to Build a Plywood Boat," Then choose an appropriate boat design for this body of water. You will never have a boat that will do everything, so don't even try. Don't build a 24' Tolman Alaskan Skiff expecting to use it on a small lake, Midwest river, or pond. On the other hand, taking your 12' rowboat 10 miles (16 km) out in the Gulf of Mexico is probably not the best idea either!
, Sorry to inform you, but free boat plans are just that...free. You get what you pay for, so if you want general information, sixty year old, antiquated, difficult-to-read, boat plans then by all means download the freebies that are so prevalent on the internet, but spend the $50-$150 for good plans and you will be very glad you did. It will save you money in the long run., A plywood boat can be beautiful if built, finished, and painted correctly. Using cheap materials will result in poor performance and could be dangerous to your health, depending on which body of water you are using your boat , how far from land you are, and how well you sealed your hull!
, It has no voids and will not de-laminate. It will also use much less epoxy resin as it won't have voids that are common to many cheaper residential construction-grade plywood., Some good brands are Aeromarine, System Three, West Marine, and Mas. The boat designer should include the amount of epoxy needed to build the boat design you choose in his/her plans. Also, buying 5–15 gallon (18.9–56.8 L) kits is the best way to save money. If you are building a larger boat you may be able to have your epoxy supplier drop ship your epoxy on a pallet to save you money on shipping.

, Sorry to those of you who thought you wouldn't have to fiberglass your boat, but the truth is 99% of good plywood boat designs are covered in fiberglass.

YouTube has many good how-to lay fiberglass videos; however finding someone local who lays fiberglass is the best way to get some hands on training. There are dozens of good marine supply stores online that will sell you a quality fiberglass and your boat plans should have the amount (length in yards) and weight (ounces) of cloth you will use on your boat.

, Of course, some of you won't care, but if you want to hear the oohs and aahs at the dock or launch giving your boat a nice finish with marine paint is the key to the longevity of your fiberglass work and the appearance of your boat. Fairing (smoothing and filling your fiberglass cloth grid...think Bondo on a car) and sanding are key to a beautiful show quality finish, but may not be necessary for a work boat in the bayou.

Determine the length of your mast as well as its diameter along the length.,
Select a light, straight-grained wood for your mast.,
Cut your wood to be a little wider, thicker, and longer than your mast.,
Use a jointer or a hand plane to plane one face of your mast perfectly flat.

,
Mark the center line of your mast on this planed face.,
Use a long, straight strip of wood (called a batten) the length of your mast or longer, to connect these marks and create a center line along the face of the mast.,
Mark the width of your mast along its length, using your center line to make sure that your widths are centered.,
Use your batten to connect the width marks along the edges of your mast on the planed face.,
Cut the outline of your mast with the planed face down using a band saw, circular saw, etc.,
Plane each of your sawn faces flat and smooth, making sure that they are perpendicular to the first flattened face.,
Repeat the steps for marking the center line and mast outlines on the two faces you just planed.,
Plane the sides that you just cut flat and perpendicular to their adjacent sides.,
Use a compass to draw a series of circles along your mast that just touch the edges of the mast.,
Draw two lines that just touch the edges of your circle, and that are perpendicular to the edge of your mast.,
Put the point of your compass in the center of the circle, and open up the compass until the pencil point just touches the corner of the box (i.e., the point where the line goes off the edge of the mast).,
Make the edge marks for the 8-sided mast.,
Go to the opposite side of the box and do this again, now going up the line.,
Check to make sure that your tic marks are accurate by taking your combination square and checking that a 45 degree angle taken from the side of the mast and going through this marked point on the box line will just touch the circle.,
Mark the edges of the 16-sided mast.,
Repeat this around the circumference of the mast using at least one side of your box.

,
Continue your lines past the box side to where they intersect.,
Connect the tic marks you've made for the 8-sided mast along the length of your mast with a batten, and draw the resulting lines.,
Do the same again with the 16-sided lines.,
Clamp your mast down using angled clamping blocks to hold it steady.

,
Start planing the first corner.

,
Plane down until you just connect the 8-sided edge marks on each of the adjoining faces.,
Take your compass and measure the width of the 16-sided face.

,
Transfer that width over to the planed side by putting the point of the compass on the existing 16-sided line and making a tic mark on the newly planed face.,
Place a batten connecting your marks and draw a line along it.,
Plane the corners down to these lines to get to a 16-sided mast.,
Plane off the tips of this zig-zag line, leaving just small line segments behind.,
Suspend the mast so that you can both hold it steady and rotate it as you work.,
Sand away!,
Varnish, starting with a slightly thinned varnish mixture to soak in.",How to Make a Solid Boat Mast," For instance, you may have a mast that is 3"" in diameter at the base tapering up to 3 1/4"" 1' up the mast, and then tapering down to 2"" starting 1' from the top. Here's a picture with an absurdly shortened mast for clarity.;
, Sitka spruce is wonderful, but boat builders have been using whatever was available for ages.

, Glue up two boards to get the desired thickness if needed.

,, Stretch a string tacked at the midpoint (widthwise) of both ends of the mast and pull it taut. Make small pencil marks directly beneath the string to mark your center line.

, Repeat this process on the opposite face to create a center line there as well. It doesn't matter if the two faces are perfectly parallel to each other just yet.

, In this case, you'd measure out 3"" at the base, (i.e., 1 1/2"" to either side of the centerline), move up 1', measure out 3 1/4"" wide, move up one more foot, measure out 3 1/4"" again (since this is where the transition to the top of the mast begins), and then go to the top of the mast and measure out 2"" wide. Repeat this process on the opposite face.

, Repeat this on the opposite face. You now have an outline of the shape of your mast on two opposite faces.

, Cut close to, but not right on, your outline. You now have two sawn faces, one planed face, and one untouched face.

, Check your progress with a combination square as you go. You now have two tapered sides that are flat (side to side) and perpendicular to one face. This means that they will also be parallel to each other.

, Then cut the outline again for these two sides.

, You now have a tapered spar that is square in cross section and is exactly the right width along its length.

, Do this on all four sides. At the very least, draw circles at the top, bottom, and transitions of your tapers. Draw at least one circle in the midpoint of your tapers, and at least one circle in the midpoint of your mast. These circles will generate the points that you will eventually plane down to, so take your time and be precise.

, Do this for each circle. What you've created here is a cross section view of your mast; you've got a box (the current mast shape) with a circle in it (your final mast shape).


You can get by with only doing one vertical line next to your circle, but the more reference points you make, the more checks for accuracy you'll have.

, Lock in that measurement.


Read the next 3 steps before making any marks, you may want to take the shortcut described in step 18 to save time.

, Take the compass with the setting you just locked in, and placing the point as close to the corner of the box as you can, tick off the distance on the line that makes up that side of the box. Make a little horizontal mark where the compass intersects the box line.


You can clamp a piece of wood to the mast so that your point is exactly half on and half off the mast.

, Repeat this on each box line.

, In other words, the tic mark you just made identifies the point on the side of your box where a 45 degree line that is tangent to your circle will just touch.


Shortcut:If you want to skip the part about using your compass, you can create these tic marks on the box side using just your 45 degree combination square, making sure that you draw your line so that it just touches the circle. Using both methods from time to time as a check is also a good idea.

,


Set a protractor (or in this case, and much easier, a protractor head on a ruler) to 67 ½ degrees. Each corner of a 16-sided mast is 22 ½ degrees, and 67 ½ is 90 degrees minus 22 ½.
Place the blade tangent to (i.e., just touching) your circle, and mark on the box side where the blade crosses it.
Draw a short horizontal line there as well.

,, If they intersect exactly on the centerline of the mast, you know you're on target. The picture to the right shows a quick summary of the lines drawn. The whole point of making these is to get the proper intersections for the edges of your mast as you start planing it down.

, In this photo the batten has been clamped to the mast. This way you don't leave little nail holes in your mast from fastening the batten.

, You now have the edges of an 8-sided and a 16-sided mast drawn.

,,,


When you're done planing down all four corners you'll have four new faces that look like this. You can see that the non-planed faces have guide marks on them for the 16-sided mast, but of course the newly planed faces don't. You’ll need to add in guide marks for the 16-sided mast on these newly planed faces.

,,


In this photo, the tic mark and line had been previously drawn, so the compass is just in position to show how the line was measured.

, At this point, you may need to do some minor adjustments if it looks like you won't get even widths between each of the 16 sides. Use your best judgment and be brave. In this photo you can see where the upper line was adjusted to make it fit better with the other sides.

,


Now you don't have any guidelines to help you get from a 16-sided mast to a 32-sided one. Instead of making new longitudinal lines, take a number of locations along the mast and connect the tips of the edges you've created with lines like this. It looks like a Charlie brown shirt.

, This will give you a visual guide as to how much you're planing off. It's not much, just a few strokes of the plane.

, It’s useful to put screws in the end and fasten it to a pair of uprights clamped to workbenches.


Here's a fancy box sander used to finish off the rounding. You can make a simpler one by making a 3-sided box and stapling sandpaper in the open fourth side. There are handles on this one, as well as a cloth backing behind the sandpaper to help keep it from tearing. Clamps along the sides of the box hold the sandpaper in, and these make it easy to change paper.

, When using the sanding box, move in a long, spiraling motion along the mast. You can go straight back and forth for a few strokes, but mostly use a long twisting motion around the mast as you go. This helps to fair out any uneven spots. Start with 60 or 80 grit paper and work your way up the grits to 150 or so.

, Follow this with a minimum of six coats of marine varnish. Eight to twelve coats are better, and will save you work in the future.

Purchase a Dock Kit from Merco Marine.,
Assemble all the hardware you need for the project.

,
There is nothing more frustrating than missing one piece of hardware while building.,
Like the hardware and tools, assemble all the wood you need for your project.,
Select your floats needed.,
Cut your frame material to the correct lengths.,
Nail the outside frame together.,
Cut and nail 2 cross stringers (2""x6"") to the bottom.,
Measure down 1"" from the top of the frame and clamp outside corner in place.,
Drill holes using 1/2"" for heavy hardware.,

Attach floats with a 3/8"" x 3"" or larger lag bolt.,
Just before decking, place the plastic plug in float drum.,

,
Start Decking.,
Decking can be done two ways: 1.,
Use a chalk line to determine where deck screws are to go - using 2"" x 6"" decking, use two deck screws for each stringer.,
Attach cleats - drill down through decking into cleat angles with 3/8"" drill.,
Nail down outside corner bumpers with stainless ring shank large head nails.,
Attach rub rail using the same stainless nails.,
Fit the sections together and put in the pins to hold together.",How to Build a Merco Marine Boat Dock," The kit will include all the hardware, fasteners, and float drums that you will require for your project.;
,, Use the hardware as designed, the dock will last 30 or more years if used as directed. Gather all your materials and tools. 2x8 PT SYP lumber for the frame, 2x6 PT SYP decking (or the decking of your choice), Merco Marine Galvanized Wood Dock Hardware, Merco Marine float drums, Merco Marine fasteners. The tools you will need are as follows: square, chalk line, pencil, hammer, tape measure, 2 C-clamps, power saw, pliers, 1/2"" drill bit, 1/4"" drill bit for float drums, 3/4"" socket and wrench, 9/16"" open end wrench, power drill. If you have access to air ratchets, it is helpful, especially on big jobs.

, We recommend at least 2"" x 8"" x length pressure treated lumber. Be selective on your lumber. Lumber that is dried out, bent or warped will make your project much harder.

, Our floats are the best in the industry because they are the best both in the shell polyethylene and polystyrene foam filling. Many float manufacturers claim they are the best. If they sell seconds, they aren't! Merco sells 45+ different sizes of floats. Remember, a float could be in the water and expected to function for the next 30 years. It should also meet or exceed Corps. of Engineers Regulation #36 CFR Part 327.

, We typically build wood frame dock in 20' sections of varying (even) widths. However, you the private homeowner may have trouble finding and transporting 20' lumber. Remember, the two exterior stringers run the entire length of your dock so their length is the same as the dock length. The interior stringers are 3"" less than the exterior stringers (interior stringers are placed 2' on center, and 2' o.c. from the side of the dock). End stringers are also placed inside the full-length side stringers, so they measure 3"" less than the width of your dock.

, (You can use your floats as a bench.) We use a couple of hot-dipped galvanized nails to hold the frame together. Put nails so the hardware covers them up. This method just makes it easier to hold together while attaching hardware. A nail gun even makes it easier. You will be building the frame right side up so make sure the top of the frame is level (decking will not fit level if they are not).

, Make sure these cross stringers do not interfere with the float drum placement. These would be the same width of the dock. When you nail these in place make sure you maintain the 2' centers. Use your tape measure and square by measuring from corner to corner.

, Use 1 clamp on top and one clamp on bottom to hold the hardware in place. Make sure hardware is tight against the wood.

, (Regular steel bits work better than wood bits and last longer.)

, Make sure the square on the carriage bolt goes in the square of the hardware. If it doesn't, use your pliers and turn the head. ***Do not tighten bolts until later a step***

,, Also attach any male or female single ""T"" if you are adding fingers to your dock. If you are adding fingers to the end of your dock, Merco has hardware with tabs on both sides of the hardware.

, Make sure they are square and flush to the side stringers. Use a 1/4"" drill and drill side stringers for lag bolts.

, Use a 3/8"" washer and a 1/2"" washer for a larger bearing surface on the float drum. These, as well as all other fasteners should be hot dipped galvanized.

, (After the decking is on, the floats, especially in the water will remain at a more constant temperature and will not swell up. Never put the plug on before attaching to the frame.)

,, Start with the end board on both ends of the dock and temporarily fasten down with a couple of deck screws. If it is an end board at the end of a finger or end of a dock it should be flush with the end stringer. If it is a section that two sections are going to be pinned together, hang those boards over 1 1/4"". This will make the gap between the two docks smaller. Although wood decking is still the most commonly used, there are a lot of vinyl and plastics such as Correct Deck (Merco Stocks). Make sure if you use vinyl or plastic the span recommended by the manufacturer is 24"" or greater. Some of them will only span 16""

, Lay down boards even with the edge of the side stringer and let excess hang over the other side or 2. Cut boards all to the correct length. (If you use method 1, screw boards down, tighten, using a chalk line, cut all deck boards off to length.)

, If you are using wet pressure treated wood you can hold decking close together. In a few weeks this wood will dry out and you will have a nice space between boards. If you use plastic or vinyl decking, you will have to space between boards. (Do not fasten down boards where you have to tighten down hardware.)

, Drive 3/8"" bolts, place on washer, nut and tighten.

, Four nails on top and four nails on the bottom.

, We recommend a nail every 6"" top and bottom.

, This is a little work but will be worth it when you put the dock in the water and it doesn't fit together. If you want to skip this, at least put pins in hardware to make sure they fit. Sometimes there is excess galvanizing which needs to be cleaned out with a 25/32"" drill bit.

Limit your driving.,
Develop good driving habits.,
Drive in high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.,
Keep your speed low.,
Try different acceleration techniques.,
Use cruise control.",How to Use Hybrid Cars Efficiently1," The best way to use your hybrid car efficiently is to not use it at all. Walk or bike to your destinations when possible. You could also use public transport, such as buses, trains, and subways. Alternately, grab a ride with a friend and carpool to your destinations.;
, Most hybrid drivers say that to maximize their hybrid’s possibilities for efficiency, they must re-learn how to drive.While things like watching their speedometer and using cruise control are not foreign to the experience of driving a regular car, they become crucial aspects of driving a hybrid.


Keep an eye on the dashboard fuel economy display, if present.This display will give you a real-time update about your fuel efficiency. Incorporate driving styles that are fuel-efficient into your regular driving behavior.
Use your brakes. Hybrids employ a technology known as regenerative braking. This means that the energy produced by the brakes -- wasted as heat in normal cars -- is used to recharge the battery of your hybrid.Apply gentle, even pressure to the brakes and gently glide to a stop.
Don’t brake too soon. Give yourself enough distance and space to effectively brake.

, HOV lanes are designed to reduce traffic during rush hour and peak travel times by vehicles with two or more people. Certain states also allow hybrid cars to make use of HOV lanes even if they contain only one passenger.


California, for instance, permits hybrid car drivers to use the HOV lane if they have a Clean Air Vehicle Sticker and their car is on the approved list. See http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm for more information.
Virginia offers a similar program.Check their list of approved hybrid vehicles at http://www.dmv.virginia.gov/vehicles/#cleanspecialfuel.asp to discover whether your hybrid can be used in HOV lanes. However, you will not be able to drive the car in HOV lanes on I-95 or I-494 with less than three passengers.

, Your hybrid car’s fuel efficiency will decline when you drive over 55 miles per hour. If you drive with the cruise control set to 70 miles per hour or more, turn it off, especially on an incline. Try to aim for a top highway speed of around 60 miles per hour.Don’t be afraid to ride in the slow lane. Let other cars pass you.
Use moderate acceleration.Accelerating too quickly will cause both the gas and electric engines to operate in tandem. When heading up a hill, Try find that Goldilocks zone with your hybrid car -- an acceleration level that is neither too slow nor too fast. Drifting in either direction will cause your mileage and fuel efficiency to decline.

, Monitor fuel efficiency while you use each. For instance, try accelerating slowly for a few weeks, then try accelerating a bit faster, and then try accelerating more quickly. Compare the mileage results of the different techniques and adopt the most fuel-efficient one.


After reaching your desired speed, coast as long as possible until you need to stop or turn.
Be mindful of how you start your vehicle at stoplights. Your hybrid is programmed to turn off the engine when in park or when you’re not moving.It will turn on again when you resume motion. Use your foot to gently apply pressure to the gas pedal to start the car in motion.

, With the cruise control on, you’re less likely to rev the engine and accelerate quickly, which can cause the gas engine to kick in to provide the extra push that rapid acceleration requires. Lay off the gas and set your cruise control to your desired speed whether you’re on the highway or on a street.If you don’t have cruise control, try to keep your speed constant. Not only does accelerating your vehicle use energy, slowing it wastes your energy as well. A constant speed is the most energy-efficient for your vehicle.

"
Manage your battery’s charge.,
Keep your battery warm.,
Use the battery rather than the gasoline engine.",How to Use Hybrid Cars Efficiently2," If your battery is fully charged, it will more quickly wear out. Similarly, if your battery is totally or nearly depleted, it will have an adverse affect on the total number of charges you’ll be able to get out of it.Keep an eye on your battery’s gauge. When you’ve charged it to an upper mid-range value, around 80%, end the recharging process. Don’t let the battery’s power drop beyond 20%.


Some hybrid manufacturers have factored this fact into their design, and have safeguards in place from preventing a battery from actually reaching a totally full or totally empty state. Consult your user manual for specifics about how to manage your battery’s charge levels.

, Keeping your battery warm really means keeping your car warm. If a battery gets cold, the amount of energy you can get out of it decreases.During winter, keep your hybrid in the garage to spare it from the worst of the cold weather.


Turn on your car and let it sit idle for a bit in order to get the battery warmed.
Excessive heat can be bad for your battery, too. A battery at ninety-two degrees Fahrenheit will only last five years. Keep your car in the garage and out of direct sunlight.

, Your hybrid might offer the option of choosing when to switch from the battery to the gasoline engine. When possible, use the battery, since you will save money on gasoline. In some cases, such as highway driving, hybrids will generally switch over to the gasoline engine automatically.


Drive within your vehicle’s battery range. Most hybrids allow between 10 and 35 miles of driving exclusively on the electric battery before they need to transition to a gasoline engine.Keep your drives short and at a close distance from your home. Stay close to home with your hybrid to maximize its efficiency.

"
"
Educate yourself before you buy.,
Check for rebates.,
Compare prices before you buy.Different dealerships often have the same vehicle model priced at different values.",How to Use Hybrid Cars Efficiently3," Figure out if you want a full hybrid, an assist, a plugin, or a mild hybrid. Weigh the pros and cons of each before making a purchase decision.


One design option you need to choose is whether to get a parallel or a series hybrid. A parallel hybrid is one in which both electric and gas engine can be used in tandem. Most hybrids are of this type. Some, however, are of the series type, in which only the gas or only the battery can operate at any given time.Full hybrids can run on electricity alone. Mild hybrids are those in which the gas engine is on all the time, and the electric battery only provides an extra boost.
Plugin hybrids can be plugged into the wall at your home or (if facilities exist) your workplace, but the gas engine will not recharge the batteries as in a non-plugin hybrid.
The decision you make about what kind of hybrid you want comes down to your motivations and your budget. If you’re an eco-warrior, you might want to choose a full or parallel hybrid. If you make a lot of long trips but still want to improve your gas mileage, a series or mild hybrid might be for you. Always purchase a car within your price range.

, Many employers offer financing and rebates for employees who want to purchase a hybrid car.Hyperion, for instance, offers $5,000 for employees who wish to purchase a hybrid. The company commits $1 million each year toward its hybrid incentive program. Google, likewise offers $5,000 for employees that purchase “fuel-efficient” vehicles, which means many hybrids qualify for this rebate. They also offer $2,500 for leased vehicles.


The federal government offers rebates of up to $7,500 on plugin hybrid vehicles that were purchased after 2010.Many states also offer similar incentives on purchasing fuel-efficient or hybrid vehicles. Check federal and state regulations to determine if you could get a rebate on your vehicle.
For a full list of state incentive programs, check out http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/state.
For a full list of vehicles that qualify for federal rebates and incentives, visit https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml.

, Look around and compare prices on the car you want. Purchase your hybrid at the lowest price possible.


Additionally, plan on negotiating with the dealership salesperson. You can often knock ten to twenty percent of the posted price of a car with some haggling.
You could also compare prices among different hybrid cars. For instance, if two different hybrid cars vary in only a few unimportant features (for instance, maybe one has passenger video screens in it while another doesn’t), you should choose the car with the lower price.
Always test-drive cars you think you might want to buy. If the car doesn’t meet your specifications, look elsewhere for one that will.

Decide if you need an extended warranty at all.,
Know if you're leasing or buying.,
Base your coverage on the life of the car.,
Do your homework before purchasing.,
Ask about manufacturer-specific warranties.,
Ask how it works.,
Find out about up-front costs.,
Inquire about upgrades.,
Review the financial stability of the company backing the warranty.",How to Choose an Extended Auto Warranty," According to checkbook.org, you're probably better off without one. They claim that a $1000 warranty typically only pays out $250 in repairs, with the rest going to marketing and overhead. ,


You may not need extensive warranty coverage on a vehicle you're leasing for a year or two. Let warranty representatives know this information up front and ask if they have warranty options specific to leased vehicles.

,


If you're going to be driving your car for several years, you will probably have to perform major repairs, like engine or transmission service. If you replace your car before the warranty expires, you may get a partial refund, but this is not ideal as most of the value of the warranty comes from repairs made at the end of its term as the vehicle ages.

,


Gather all the information you need to select an extended auto warranty package before you purchase the car. Planning ahead will help you avoid being pressured into coverage you don't need. It can also help you avoid penalties or extra charges assessed for adding warranties after the date of purchase.

,


Most major auto manufacturers offer brand-specific warranties that cover more extensive repairs than private or after-market warranty vendors. Ask your auto dealer about brand-specific or manufacturer warranties available for your vehicle and compare all your warranty options.

,


Depending on the type of warranty you purchase, you may be able to have your car serviced at any authorized dealer or you may be required to take it back to the dealer or lot where you purchased it. Ask about this requirement so you know what restrictions you will have to get service and maintenance covered under the extended warranty. Read the contract carefully. Many contracts don't cover certain types of common repairs.

,


Ask your warranty representative to explain the process of obtaining service coverage under your chosen extended warranty package. Some warranties will pay the mechanic directly, while others will require you to pay up front and submit a bill for reimbursement. Consider which process will work better for your financial situation before choosing an extended auto warranty.

,


You might choose one level of coverage and determine later that you need more coverage. Find out if the warranty you choose offers coverage upgrades or if you'll be locked into one level for the life of the warranty.

, Your service plan is worthless if the company goes out of business before you need to file a claim. Look for an A- or better rating from A.M. Best.

Identify the tachometer before driving.,
Start the vehicle.,
Press the gas pedal and note its effect on the tachometer.,
Glance at the tachometer periodically while driving.,
Avoid over-revving the engine.",How to Check RPM1," Get into the driver’s seat of the vehicle and take a good look at your gauges. Most vehicles come equipped with a speedometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and a tachometer. They may be arranged in a number of ways depending on the make and model of your vehicle.The tachometer usually shows single or double digit numbers that increase into a red band, which shows RPMs above the redline for the vehicle.
The redline is the highest number of RPMs your vehicle can manage safely.;
, With a good understanding of where to find each gauge, press the brake pedal with your right foot and turn the key in the ignition to start the vehicle. You’ll notice the tachometer climbs rapidly, before settling on the number of RPMs your vehicle idles at.Idling is when the engine is running without any fuel input from the driver.

, With the vehicle in park (or neutral with the parking brake engaged) press your foot on the gas pedal and observe the tachometer. As you increase the amount of gas going into the engine, the RPMs climb to match.Getting a sense of how quickly your engine revs will help make driving a standard vehicle easier.
If you were unsure which gauge was the tachometer, this will help you identify it.

, If driving a vehicle equipped with a standard transmission, it’s important that you maintain a sense of how many RPMs the engine is at in each gear you are in. Glance at the tachometer frequently, just as you check each of your mirrors.The tachometer will show you how many RPMs you are at in each gear, indicating when to switch to the next one.
You should be checking your speed periodically as well, so glancing at the tachometer should be an easy addition.

, The red line on the tachometer represents the highest number of revolutions the engine is capable of withstanding safely. While you should never approach the red line in normal driving, you may occasionally when accelerating quickly. Shift into the next gear before exceeding the red line on your tachometer.Spinning the engine at too many RPMs can cause serious internal damage.

Purchase a handheld tachometer.,
Ground the black lead from the tachometer.,
Run the positive lead to the green wire on the ignition coil.,
Set the tachometer for the number of cylinders.,
Start the engine and read the screen on the tachometer.",How to Check RPM2," A mechanic’s tachometer or handheld “tach-tool” looks like a multimeter or a volt gauge and can be purchased at most auto parts stores. Ensure you purchase a tachometer and not one of the other tools that look similar.Some tools may have multiple functions. Ensure the tool you purchase includes tachometer among those functions.

, Open the hood of the vehicle and connect the black lead coming out of the tachometer to the negative terminal on the battery or any bare metal on the body of the vehicle.Ensure the ground wire is connected firmly and won’t come loose while the engine starts.
Be sure the wire won’t get caught by any belts or other moving parts once the engine starts.

, The positive lead from the tachometer will be red. It must be connected to the ignition coil to read the signals it sends and translate that into RPMs. If you do not wish to splice the wire for this temporary reading, insert an unfolded paper clip into where the green wire connects to the ignition coil, then clip the lead onto the paper clip.Ensure the lead has a solid, metal on metal connection so it can read the signals coming from the ignition coil.

, Turn the dial on the tachometer to the number of cylinders in your engine. Most handheld tachometers have a knob on the front of the device you simply turn until it points at the correct setting.If you are unsure how many cylinders are in your engine, refer to the vehicle’s owner’s manual for guidance.
If your vehicle came equipped with a five, ten or twelve cylinder engine, ensure you purchase a tachometer that can support that.

, While holding the tachometer, ask a friend to get into the vehicle and turn the key in the ignition. Once the engine starts, the tachometer will begin displaying the number of RPMs the engine is running at.Some tachometers list single digits that represent thousands of RPMs, others show double digits that represent hundreds of RPMs or three digits that show tens of RPMs.
Refer to the package for your tool to know for sure which your tachometer displays.
Do not drive the vehicle using this form of tachometer. It is only effective for engine diagnostics and diagnosis.

"
Remove the tachometer housing.,
Set the tachometer for the number of cylinders in your engine.,
Ground the black wire.,
Connect the red wire to a fused switch.,
Run the white wire to a constant power source.,
Connect the green wire to the ignition coil.,
Mount the tachometer.",How to Check RPM3," The back of the tachometer is encompassed in a housing that is sometimes referred to as a “cup.” This cup can be removed by either twisting it off the tachometer or by removing a single screw on the bottom or top, depending on the brand of tachometer.Make sure you don’t lose the screw if your tachometer comes equipped with one, as you’ll need it to put the tach back together.
Refer to the instructions that came with your tachometer if you are having trouble determining how to remove the housing.

, There are a series of switches on the back of the tachometer once the housing is removed. These switches set how many cylinders there are in the engine so the tachometer can understand the signal from the ignition coil. Set the switches to match your vehicle’s engine.Most tachometers have the switches labeled, so it’s easy to determine which to turn on for four, six and eight cylinder applications.
If the switches are not labeled, refer to the instructions that came with the tachometer to set the switches properly.
Put the housing back on the tachometer once you have the engine setting set.

, The wires coming out of the back of the tachometer are color coded to make it easy to determine where each wire should go. Run the black wire from the tachometer to a ground. You may choose to run it through the firewall on the vehicle to the negative terminal on the battery. You can also wire it to any bare metal portion of the body of the vehicle.The ground wire is one of two required in order to complete the electrical circuit.
You may choose to wrap the wire around a bolt and tighten it or solder it in place.

, The red wire provides the tachometer with power when the vehicle is running. Use an “add-a-fuse” or fuse pigtail to connect this wire to a fuse that powers something that only operates when the vehicle is running, such as the interior lights or radio.Locate the fuse box on the driver’s side of the interior of the vehicle.
Remove the fuse and insert the fuse pigtail in a similar fashion to when replacing a blown out fuse.

, The white wire coming from the back of the tachometer must be connected to a constant power source. Run it through the hole in the firewall separating the engine from the cabin of the vehicle. The easiest place to do so may be in the holes the gas, brake and clutch pedal pass through the firewall. Once through, connect this wire to the positive terminal on the battery.It may be difficult to run the wire through the hole in the firewall. Use a flashlight to help locate the hole below the dashboard.
Insert the wire into the pigtail that attaches to the positive terminal on the battery so it is easy to disconnect with the battery.

, The green wire will also need to run through a hole in the firewall and to one of the ignition coils in your engine. Locate the ignition coil by following the spark plug wires backward from the spark plugs. The coil will have three wires coming from it. Splice the green wire from the tachometer into the green wire on the ignition coil.This wire transmits the RPM information to the tachometer when the engine is running.
Be sure the wire is not run over any moving parts that may snag it when the engine is running.

, Use the screws that came with the tachometer to mount it someplace visible to you, but that won’t impede your vision while driving. A common location is on the side of the dash board near the A-pillar.Special gauge pods can be purchased to help mount the gauge in a visually pleasing way.
Tuck all of the wires so they are no longer visible.

Elevate the boat.,
Sand down the sides.,
Clean the boat thoroughly.,
Prime the sides.,
Choose a good stencil.,
Determine your camo color scheme.,
Start with the lightest color.,
Progress through the remaining colors.,
Apply a final clear coat.",How to Camo a Boat," Position your boat on top of a boat stand so that it is off the ground yet low enough for you to access without much difficulty. Elevating the boat will make it easier for you to work on all sides.








If you do not have a boat stand to use, you could also use cinder blocks. A boat stand is preferable, though, since cinder blocks will cover a portion of the bottom and prevent you from painting it.













Keep the boat right side up as you paint it. You will need to paint both the inside and the outside of the boat in order to make the entire thing camouflaged, so you need access to the inside of the boat. By contrast, the bottom of the boat will be hidden under water most of the time, so ducks and similar prey are less likely to see it. You should still camouflage as much of the bottom as you can reach, though.












;
, Use a portable electric sander to smooth all the sides of the boat. Start with the inner part of the boat and sand the exterior sides afterward.









Sanding the boat will remove any old paint or other inconsistencies. As a result, your final painting job will be smoother and neater.













If you do not have a portable electric sander, you could use a sanding block, instead.














, Combine soap and hot water in a large bucket and use the solution to scrub down all sides of the boat. Wash the boat using a hard bristled brush so that you can eliminate more debris in the process.









As you did while sanding the boat, clean the interior before cleaning the exterior.













The cleaning solution you use should be very sudsy. For best results, use a soap that is specifically labeled for whatever material your boat is made from. Otherwise, use liquid dish detergent.













For the best results, you should also consider rinsing down the exterior sides of your washed boat with a water hose that has been fitted with a power sprayer nozzle.













It is vital that you let the boat dry completely before moving on with primer or paint. You can either towel dry the boat or let it air dry.














, A good primer will protect the boat and also improve the final look of your boat after you paint it. If you have an aluminum boat, choose a primer with rust proofing. Otherwise, any waterproof primer might be adequate.









Thin the primer before using it. Doing so can make it easier for the primer to go on and to work its way into the tiny scratches on the side of the boat. As such, your boat will be better protected.














, You can purchase large stencils for the side of your boat online or in various stores with hunting and outdoor living products. If you are not sure about where to start, look for stencils of marsh grasses or cattails.









If you do not want to buy actual stencils, you can create your own by holding actual cattails or swamp grasses up to your boat as you paint it. You could also use skinny pieces of round pipe.













You could also cut actual stencils out of poster board. Print or sketch the design onto the board and cut out the portions that need o be filled in with your secondary paint.












Do not use pieces of tape instead of actual stencils or stencil-like elements. Tape will create harsh, sharp lines, and your camouflage will look more out of place as a result. Faded edges are preferable to sharp edges.













When you attach any type of stencil to your boat, you will need to adhere it on securely with strong tape. Alternatively, you could simply hold up the stencil to the boat side as you spray instead of fixing it in place.













A marsh grass or cattail pattern is usually the most typical pattern for a boat. On the other hand, you could opt for a more traditional sort of camouflage composed of randomly arranged wavy shapes. The choice is ultimately a matter of personal preference.













, For practical use, there are only a few color schemes that will actually help camouflage your boat in the water. An earth tone scheme might help, or you could opt for a marine-oriented or navy-oriented palette.








Earth tone palettes make use of tans, browns, and the occasional deep green.













Marine and navy oriented palettes blend shades of blue with shades of brown.













Ultimately, when you choose a color scheme, think about the area you will be using your boat in and try to find three or four colors that will blend in with the surroundings of that area.














, Take the lightest color involved in your pattern and paint the entire boat with one coating of that shade. Allow the paint to dry thoroughly for about 24 hours, and apply a second coat. That coat should also dry for about 24 hours.









Note that you will not be using a stencil for this portion of the project.













The surface temperature of the boat should be at least 51 degrees Fahrenheit (10.5 degrees Celsius) when you begin. Avoid painting the boat in temperatures lower than that since cooler temperatures may make it more difficult for the paint to spread and dry.













Use a paint sprayer instead of a brush or roller in order to achieve the best results.













It is also important that you start with the lightest color, rather than a darker shade. A light hue will not show up beneath a dark overcoat, but a dark paint will likely show through a light overcoat.














, Apply your stencil to the side of the boat and use the darker colors in your camouflage palette to fill in the pattern.









Work with the light to medium tones first and end with the darkest color you have.













Choose paints that have a matte, non-reflective finish in water.













Allow the paint to dry for a full 24 hours.













For this part of the process, you can either use a paint sprayer or cans of spray paint. Cans of spray paint might be preferable since they will allow you to paint finer lines and details.













Spray over the stencils in even strokes. The part of the boat covered by your cattails or stencil backing will remain as your lightest color, while the parts that are open will be painted in your secondary colors.













Mist the color onto the boat by holding the paint can back at a distance. Spray up and down over the stencil with each color to get even coatings.












Try not to make the pattern look too symmetrical or planned. The lines of your pattern should be somewhat evenly spaced, but they should each tilt at different angles and no set of lines should be spaced apart evenly with another set of lines.














, Use a paint sprayer to coat the entire boat in a single layer of clear, matte or flat paint. This clear coat can protect your paint job from scratches.









Note that if you choose an oil-based paint, you can also help waterproof your paint job.

Check the fluids in your car.,
Check your air pressure.,
Get the oil changed before you leave if it's almost time for a change.,
Check your tire wear by using a penny or tread gauge.,
Check your car's air filter.,
Wash your car.,
Check to be certain that all lights and signals are functional on your car.,
Ensure that you have all emergency equipment inside your car, and that everything works properly.",How to Check Your Car Before a Road Trip," Checking the oil, coolant, brake fluid and windscreen wash levels may help you avoid an accident or an unnecessary breakdown. Also check the levels for the clutch fluid (often the same as brake fluid) and power steering fluid (if fitted to your car). Refer to your owner's manual to see where fluid reservoirs are located.;
, These should be printed in the owner's manual or a sticker on the body where the driver's door shuts. The pressure marked on the side of the tire is the max, which must not be exceeded. Also, don't forget to check your spare tire pressure. Often neglected, not doing so will turn a bad time into a worse one if the spare is unusable.

, A long trip can put additional stress on your motor. Don't think that adding extra oil by yourself will work like an oil change, because that does not get rid of the sludge from old used oil. You may not realize this due to the fact that you are continuously adding new, cleaner oil which makes it appear as if it is clean oil. When changing your car's oil, you must always replace the oil filter at the same time.

, Ensure you have at least 1/16th"" or 1.6mm tread left. If the tread is less than 1/12"" or 2.5mm, consider replacing your tires for very long journeys as they will wear down more quickly. Tires heat up on long trips which can cause blowouts on worn out tires.

, A plentiful supply of clean air to your engine improves the vehicle's performance and efficiency. Also check and change your car's cabin (pollen) filter if it has one, as these are often ignored in services and, if worn, adversely affect the quality of air in the cabin.

, At the minimum, clean the windows of your car for the best visibility. Also check the condition of your wiper blades and replace them if necessary.

, You may need the help of another person for this. Sit in the car, turn on each light or signal and ask your friend to tell you if it is working or not. Replace bulbs as necessary. Also consider carrying spare bulbs on a road trip (at least one for each light eg. headlights, indicators, tail lights, reverse lights). Changing bulbs (especially front) can take time in modern cars, so don't leave this to the last minute if bulbs need changing.


Occasionally, lights may not work because a fuse needs replacing. Consider checking your headlights alignment (using a white garage door or inside a garage) and adjusting the alignment if it is incorrect as poor headlight alignment will reduce visibility at night, especially on unlit roads.

, Emergency equipment includes: an up-to-date map, cell phone, spare tire (alternatively a puncture repair kit, although this is not ideal) and emergency tools (e.g. flashlight, screwdrivers, pliers and an adjustable spanner). Although usually absent; flares, medical kits and fire extinguishers may come in handy in worse-case scenarios. Carry a reflective warning triangle if traveling in a EU member state as these are mandatory. If you are traveling from a right-hand drive to a left-hand drive country, then look to see if beam deflectors for your headlights are mandatory (so other road users are not dazzled), for example traveling from the UK to mainland Europe or from South Africa into another African country.

Make sure it's a fuse issue.,
Find the fuse panel.,
Try to test fuses before removing.,
Test the suspect fuses.",How to Change Fuses in a Car1," When one circuit has too much electricity flowing through it, the fuse blows to prevent serious damage and even fire. The best way of knowing if a fuse has blown, is if an electric component instantly stops working i.e. window stops while rolling up or down, radio stops workings, or all of the dash lights go out at once. If an electric component has been slowly getting worse, it is not likely a fuse but it is still good to check the fuses regularly.;
, The owner's manual will tell where the vehicle's fuse panel is. Most models situate the fuse panel on the driver's side of the dashboard and under the steering wheel, but location varies from vehicle to vehicle. Remove the fuse panel's cover; there will be several different color-coded fuses plugged in. These colors, along with the numbers stamped on the fuses, indicate different amperage ratings. On the backside of the fuse panel there will be a diagram that shows which fuse corresponds with which electrical component. If the owner's manual is unavailable, try contacting a dealership for the location or a simple internet search can provide enough information to locate the fuse panel and specific fuses.

, Once the fuse panel is located, remove the cover and locate the fuse puller, most vehicles come with a small fuse puller but not all will have one. Before removing any fuses, it is possible to test a fuse before removing it, this requires either a continuity test light, or a multi-meter / ohm meter.

, To test a fuse without removing it, using the two probes of either the test light or multi-meter, touch the two small metal tabs located on the top of the fuse. These tabs can be tricky to connect to, but once sure that the probes are making contact, if the fuse has continuity (test light lights up) or has a resistance reading (may read 0 or 0.001milli-ohm) then the fuse is good. If these tools are unavailable, simply use the fuse puller that was in the fuse panel, or a small pair of pliers, or just bare fingers to remove and visually inspect any fuses. If the fuse is bad, it needs to be replaced.

"
"
When replacing a fuse you must use a fuse that has the same amperage rating.,
Check the circuit.",How to Change Fuses in a Car2," Use the fuse panel diagram, the numbered color-coded fuses and the owner’s manual to help you determine the correct amperage for your new fuse. Once you have the right fuse gently push it into the correct slot, make sure it’s completely installed, and then put the fuse panel back on the car.

, Once you are done replacing the fuse, turn the ignition and check to see if the circuit giving you trouble is working correctly. If it is working, chances are you just had a temporary surge that blew the fuse. If that's the case, then you just solved the problem.

Shop around and review different booster seat types.There are several varieties of booster seats to choose from.,
Choose a booster seat your child finds comfortable.,
Make sure the booster seat fits in your car.,
Register your booster seat.,
Read the instructions.While the general techniques for installing a booster seat are the same for all types, each model is designed slightly differently and has specific instructions.,
Place the booster seat in your car’s rear seat.Booster seats should always be installed in a vehicle’s rear seat, never in a front seat.,
Use any clips or guides the booster may have.Some booster seats, but not all, have clips or guides to help you position the seatbelt across the seat.,
Check the fit of the booster seat.Once the booster seat is properly installed, have your child sit in it (while the vehicle is not in motion) to ensure a good fit.,
Check the fit regularly.As your child grows, you may have to adjust the seatbelt or position of the booster seat.,
Secure the booster seat when it is not in use.A booster seat should always be used whenever the child it is intended for is in your vehicle.,
Use the booster seat as long as necessary.General guidelines recommend that children use booster seats until they are 8 years old or have reached 4’ 9” in height.Once you child is above this age/or height, he or she can use an adult seat belt.",How to Install a Booster Seat," They vary in design, material, and price. Choose one that fits your vehicle, suits your child, and meets your current and future needs.Backless booster seats do not have a back (as the name suggests), but rest on your vehicle’s rear seat. Your child’s back is supported by the back of the vehicle’s seat.
High back booster seats have their own support for your child’s back to rest against. These fit within your vehicle’s rear seat much like a forward-facing child safety seat. High back booster seats are recommended for vehicles without headrests on the rear seat.Combination child safety seat/booster seats can be used first as a child safety seat and then converted to a booster seat when your child is old enough or big enough.;
, Booster seats are not latched to your car in the same way that car seats are. Instead, they are held in place by your child’s weight and your car’s seat belt.For this reason, it is very important to find a booster seat that you child can sit comfortably on. Choose a booster seat that is neither too large nor too small for your child.

, A booster seat will rest on top of your car’s back seat, much like a car seat. It will also be strapped in using the car’s seatbelt.Therefore, it is critical that the booster seat fit properly into your car and onto the rear seat. Make sure:


The booster seat fits fully on your car’s rear seat, and does not hang over the edge.
The booster seat sits flat on your car’s rear seat, and is not turned or tilted.
At least one of your car’s rear lap-shoulder seatbelts (not just a lap seatbelt) is able to fit fully around the booster seat so that you can secure it in place.

, As soon as you have purchased a booster seat, register it with the manufacturer, according to the instructions that are provided with the packaging. This is necessary to validate the warranty, and will also help the manufacturer notify you in the event that there is a recall on the booster seat.

, To make sure that you know how your booster seat functions, and how to install it, always read the manufacturer’s instructions and safety information that are provided with the seat when you purchase it.

, The best location for a booster seat is in the center of a vehicle’s rear seat, as long as it fits properly there. However, if your vehicle only has a lap belt in the center position of the rear seat, install the booster seat on the right or left side.


If you cannot install a booster seat in the center of the rear seat, choose the side (right or left) that will allow you to best see your child from the driver’s seat, and make it easiest to safely remove the child from the vehicle on busy streets.

, Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided with your booster seat regarding how to use these, if applicable.

, Position the seatbelt as you normally would, and make sure the child is snug but comfortable in the booster seat, and that it remains secure on your vehicle’s back seat when your child is sitting in it.


Adjust your vehicle’s seat belt, if necessary. You should use a lap-shoulder combination seat belt. The lap portion should rest on the child’s torso (not stomach), and the shoulder portion should fit across his/her chest.
You can also visit a local police department, fire department, or other safety center to have an official check to make sure your booster seat is installed properly., It may also shift slightly during transit. Because of this, it is a good idea to check the fit and position of the booster seat regularly. Always make sure that the seatbelt fits your child correctly, and that the booster seat remains secure on your vehicle’s rear seat.

, When the booster seat is not being used, it should be secured (for instance, strapped down or stowed in the trunk). Otherwise, a loose booster seat moving around while you are driving the vehicle can cause injury or become a dangerous distraction.,


Laws, regulations, and recommendations can vary by area. Always check the guidelines for using booster seats that are applicable where you live.

Check the height and weight limit on your infant bucket seat.,
Switch to a rear facing car seat.,
Switch from a rear facing bucket seat to a convertible car seat.",How to Know when to Change Carseats1," Switch from the infant bucket seat to the rear facing seat when your child exceeds the height and weight limit of the infant bucket seat. The height and weight limit are listed on the infant bucket seat., If your child is between one and two years of age, when they outgrow their infant seat, you should switch to a rear facing car seat. The rear facing car seat is safer for children in this age bracket based on a number of recent tests and state laws. The convertible version of the rear facing car seat is a little larger and allows your child to stay in the rear position for longer, so that is also an option.Rear facing car seats are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for children under the age of two or until the child exceeds the height and weight listed on the car seat.It is best to keep your child in the rear facing seat until they reach the height and weight limit even if they are older than two years of age.
If you are in a collision and your child is seated in a rear facing car seat, they will move deeper into the seat rather than away from it. This is safer than if they were facing forward.

, If your child outgrows their rear facing infant bucket seat, you can switch over to a larger convertible car seat. This car seat will allow you to keep your child in the rear facing position when they are a bit bigger.In the United Kingdom, look for i-size car seats that allow you to keep your child in the rear facing position for longer."

Look at the manual to figure out the height and weight limits for the forward facing car seat.Choose high-back booster seats as opposed to backless boosters. The high-back boosters offer better head support for your child., You should keep your child in the forward facing harness seat for as long as possible or, in other words, until they have outgrown the height and weight limits of the forward facing harness seat.Recent studies have reconfirmed the improved safety of belt-positioning booster seats compared to regular seat belts for children between four and eight years of age., When your child gets to 4’9’’ in height and is between eight and twelve years of age, you can move them to the regular car seat. However, you should also check your state laws to make sure you can have your child in a regular seat. Many states require children to be in booster seats until age ten or twelve.


Given the improved safety of booster seats in comparison to seat belts for children up to eight years of age, you should avoid shifting your children out of them too early.
To check if your child can graduate to sitting in the regular car seat, see if your child’s knees bend nicely over the edge of the seat.To check if your child can graduate to sitting in the regular car seat, check if the shoulder belt rests comfortably over their shoulders. If it rests over their face, they should still be in a booster seat."

Let the belt dry.",How to Clean a Seat Belt1," Gently pull the belt forward until it can go no further. When this happens, the entire belt will be unspooled and much easier to reach.






;
, Follow the belt strap upwards and locate the reel. This is where the majority of the belt is stored when not in use. Attach a metal clamp on the belt right next to the reel. The belt will be unable to retract back into the reel.








Metal clamps can be found at hardware stores.

, An all-purpose cleaner or a fabric cleaner are safe to use on the belt to remove stains. These are purchased from a general store and come in spray bottles. All-purpose cleaners are designed for even delicate fabrics and should not have bleach in them. Spray all along the belt, creating a light, even coating. Don’t forget the underside.








A mixture of equal parts of a gentle, neutral pH detergent such as Dawn dish soap or a baby wash and water can be used as a cleaner instead.Vinegar and vinegar-based cleaners are useful for removing smells, but vinegar is an acid and too much of it can damage the belt’s integrity over time. Use baby wipes and delicate fabric cleaners instead.

, Take a stiff-bristled scrubbing brush. Work from the top end of the belt and move downwards. Don’t move the brush in circles or go back up the belt. Move gently to avoid wearing out the belt’s threads.








A second coating of cleaner can be added to deeply stained belts.

, Surround the belt with the towel and drag the towel downwards along the belt. This removes excess moisture. Only use microfiber towels. These towels are gentlest on the belt’s threads.







, Leave the belt alone for at least overnight. If it isn’t completely dry, leave it for longer. It’s important to make sure the belt is dry before you unclamp it and let it retract so that mold doesn’t grow on it.

If your witnesses corroborate and they still do not move, explain that they are being lame and that you would never do such a thing for them.,
If they still don't move, find another seat/stand.,
NOTE: Seat check also applies if called for any seat of mobile vehicles if said person is sitting in the seat.","How to Call ""Seat Check"""," Many people do not realize this, but the purpose of the seat check is to prove that you realize that your seat must be protected and establish ""dibs"" (and therefore the moral high ground). Therefore, you must call seat check BEFORE leaving your seat. Attempting to call it from across the room or after you have stood up, as someone rushes into it is extremely lame and forfeits the entire point of the check.;
, You don't need to disturb the conversation, but mumbling it under your breath doesn't do any good, as people will question whether you called it at all.

, It was designed so that you can grab a pop or run to the bathroom without someone sliding in right behind you. Don't expect to be covered if you are leaving the house or otherwise will be gone for more than 1 hour. Similarly, taking another seat or joining a different conversation automatically voids the seat check.

, If it is unoccupied, return calmly. If it is occupied, don't freak out. It is perfectly acceptable for someone to use your seat while you are gone, and in most cases they will happily move once they realize that you are back. If they do not, continue to steps #5-#8

,,, Be sure the rest of the room knows what's going on.

, You may not have your seat, but you were the bigger man and definitely earned morale points with the rest of the room.

, Though, these rules apply going to the next ride in the car only. Seat Check MUST be called BEFORE the leaving of car. Seat Check over rides shotgun if called.

These organizations and safety ratings vary by country; Australia, for example, has some of the strictest safety ratings for car seats.In Canada, Transport Canada publishes information about car seats.In the United States, consult Consumer Reportsor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for information about safety ratings.Additional information can also be found at the National Child Passenger Safety Board’s website.;
, If a particular car seat has defects in it, its manufacturer may have issued a recall. The car seat would then be returned to the manufacturer for a new seat or a refund. When you are looking into different car seats and brands, check to see if there have been any recalls on the particular car seat model or the brand itself. Search online for “car seat recall” to find the most up-to-date information.

, All car seats have basic features that will ensure a solid level of safety and comfort for your infant. Many car seats do, however, have additional features. These might include additional side-impact cushioning, extra padding all around the seat, or an anti-rebound bar at the foot of the car seat. At the end of a major crash, during the rebound, the car seat might bounce up and hit the seat in front of it. The anti-rebound bar, available in newer seats, is intended to minimize the impact that the car seat will take., There should be one strap per limb: one for each upper arm and one for each thigh, as well as one for the area between the child's legs. There are alternative restraint systems, such as plastic shields and T-bar restraints, but the strap system is more customizable, which can make the seat more comfortable for your child’s size.

, Starting in 2002, all infant car seats were required to be compatible with the LATCH system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children. The LATCH system allows infant car seats to attach directly into a car seat rather than being held in place by the seatbelt. Hooking up directly into a car seat will maximize the safety of your child in your vehicle.


The LATCH system is compatible with or known by different names in other countries. In Canada, the system is called the Universal Attachment System (UAS). In Europe, the system is called ISOFIX, and ISOFIX compatible in Australia., As car seats are used, their materials deteriorate and can become less reliable. Car seat manufacturers imprint their seats with expiration dates, typically 6 years after the date of manufacture. This date can usually be found imprinted into the plastic on the back or bottom of a car seat. Ensure that the car seat has not been in a crash; this might compromise the integrity of the seat and its materials. If the seat is older than 6 years, it is not recommended for use.

, There are two kinds of car seats available for infants: infant car seats and convertible car seats. Infant car seats only last for the infant stage, but are usually considered safer for babies, especially smaller babies. Convertible car seats will last for a few years, accommodating the child as she grows from infant to toddler to preschooler.


An infant seat is only for babies, and will always be rear-facing in the car. It usually has a base that is strapped into the back seat of a car, and a snap-in seat that can be removed and carried. These seats are recommended for weights up to 22 or 40 pounds, depending on the model. The snap-in seat can be more convenient, as it can be removed from the car without disturbing the infant.
A convertible seat will be rear-facing for at least the first year of the baby’s life (most safety organizations and manufacturers now recommend two years for rear-facing seating), and then the seat will “convert” into a seat for a toddler. These seats can accommodate up to 40 or 50 pounds, depending on the model.
Pay attention first and foremost to a car seat’s weight and height limits, not to the age of your child.

, You will need to have a car seat to transport the baby in just about any moving vehicle once it is born. If you are taking the baby home from the hospital, the nurse who discharges you will likely need to confirm that you have a properly installed car seat in your car. If you are going home in a taxi, you will still need a car seat for your baby to safely and legally ride in a car.

, If you are using an infant car seat that you will snap in and out of a base, think about how much you will be carrying this around. Also consider the weight of the baby; adding the car seat and the baby together may mean you’re toting around 30 pounds or more. Removable infant car seats also have handles to carry them; test out the handle to see how comfortable it is in your hand.

, If you are buying a car seat before the baby is born, you will not be able to complete this step. If you are buying a new car seat for an infant that is already born, however, consider if the baby has any allergies or sensitivities to certain materials, such as plastics, polyurethane, wool or cotton, or other materials. Most babies will likely not be affected by allergies to seat materials, but if your baby is particularly sensitive, you may want to take this into account when buying a seat.

, Many parents buy car seats that can be transferred into grandparents’ cars or nannies’ cars. Consider how much you will be transferring the car seat to another car and factor that into your purchase decision. Make sure the car seat is easy to install. Also consider how easily the seat can be adjusted as the baby grows. The seat harness straps will need to be adjusted as the baby grows, and many of these need to be re-threaded through the seat back. This can be a time-consuming task, so take into account how easy these adjustments will be.

, Smaller cars may need smaller car seats. Drivers with long legs may need to put their seats all the way back, which minimizes the amount of space behind the driver’s seat that can accommodate a car seat. This is particularly important to consider when you have a rear-facing car seat. There may already be a car seat or two in the car, depending on the number of children riding in the car. Choose a seat that will fit in your car.

, Car seats can range greatly in price, from $50 to $150 or more. They all do meet the minimum safety standards, but more expensive car seats may have additional features, higher quality fabric, additional padding, cup holders and compartments, and so on. Balance how much money you spend with what you realistically need in a car seat. If you are planning to have more children or pass the car seat along to a family member to use, and the car seat will get more use, you may want to get something a little more durable that will last.


Consider the fabric and pattern of the car seat. Infant car seats will inevitably get covered in stains, and having washable fabric that also emphasizes stains can be helpful.

, Research several car seats online to find out what their pros and cons are. Ask friends and family which types of car seats they use and what they like or dislike about them. This will help you make an informed decision about which car seat will be best for you.

, These stores should have a range of models to choose from. You should do some online research to determine which seat will be the best for you, but seeing the seat in person goes a long way in figuring out which seats look the best, feel the best, and offer the best safety. Bigger stores like Target, Toys R Us or Babies R Us, or Walmart also sell car seats and usually have a decent selection of seats. Ask a clerk for help or suggestions with car seats, and for advice on installation, adjustment, and so on.

, The United States federal WIC (Women Infants Children) program often gives out vouchers for free car seats to low-income families. If you are already registered with WIC, inquire at your local office to find out more about the program. They may require that you take a 1-2 hour class on car seat safety, and then you can receive a voucher for a free car seat.


Free car seats may also be available through your health insurance, local fire or police department or hospital. Everyone wants an infant to ride safely in a car, and if the family is low-income and cannot afford to buy a new car seat, there are resources in most communities to ensure that they have access to a new car seat.

, While infant car seats are small, there might still be surplus room for their little body. A newborn baby cannot hold its head up and needs extra support to stay comfortable. There is a range of head support pillows and padding that are specially made to fit in car seats. These can be placed behind the baby with the pillow around its head, and can be removed when the baby has grown.

, Because the baby is rear-facing in its car seat, the driver can’t see how the baby is doing. Mirrors that can be attached to the car seat are available, which enable the driver to look in their rear view mirror and see the baby in the baby’s mirror.

, Dressing a baby warmly enough in winter can be a challenge, especially when you need to get the car seat harness around the baby properly. There are blankets and other coverings available that are specially made to fit in car seats, with holes in the blanket for the seat harness. These are available in a variety of weights and colors, and can keep the baby cozy in the car.

, Newborn babies don’t really need toys to play with, but it can be entertaining for an older infant to play with a colorful toy that looks like an animal or a face, or a toy that makes noises. Many of these toys can dangle from the handle of the car seat. While you are driving, the handle of the car seat is bent down so it is not above the baby’s head, but the toys can still be within reach.

Don’t use one that has bleach or vinegar, since the acid can damage the belt. Most stains can be handled by detergent or fabric cleaner no matter the origin. You don’t have many options for cleaners because they are too harsh for the seat belt.







, Dip the bristles of the brush into the bowl to pick up some of the cleaner. Minimize the amount of moisture on the brush as much as possible to avoid soaking the seat belt.

, Move downwards from the top of the stain. Be careful not to move the brush in a circle or go back up the belt. Scrub the stain gently, adding small amounts of cleaner when necessary to apply a light, even coating.








, For truly stubborn stains, you or a professional can use a steam machine or hot water extractor. Once you’ve added a coating of fabric cleaner or upholstery shampoo, run the machine over the belt on a low moisture setting."

, Find the reel where the belt spools when not in use. Place the metal clamp on the belt next to the reel. The belt will no longer be able to retract.








, Pour about one tablespoon (15 mL) of a non-bleach dish soap into a cup (240 mL) of warm water. Add two tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar. Stir the mixture until soapy., Use a soft-bristled brush to gently work in the cleaner. Dip it in the mixture and move it downwards from the top of the belt.

, Use a dry microfiber towel in order to avoid adding moisture that can damage the integrity of the belt’s threads. Squeeze the belt between the towel and gently move up and down to remove excess moisture.









For recurrent mold issues, spray on a mold preventative such as Concrobium Mold Control or Mold Armor while the belt is still damp. Try to choose one that doesn’t have bleach in the ingredient list.

, Leave the belt overnight or until dry. It must be completely dry before you remove the clamp or else the wet belt will provide ample breeding ground for mold and nasty odors inside the reel."

If you want seat covers that can be thrown in the washing machine in the event of stains, a polyester-cotton blend may be best.

, The color can be different from the shade of your original car seats, but it should complement the exterior of your car. Keep in mind that lighter covers tend to show stains easily, while black covers may feel particularly hot on warm days.

, This is an ideal way to show some personality in your car. For example, a Hawaiian pattern can display your fun side, while camouflage can provide your car with a masculine look.

Choose an infant car seat if you have a newborn baby.,
Get a convertible car seat that will last from infant to toddler.,
Go for a belt-positioning booster seat if your child is over four.,
Consider getting a car seat that will fit into a baby stroller.",How to Choose the Right Car Seat1," If you have a newborn baby, you should invest in a rear-facing infant car seat. These seats are designed to be safer for babies that weigh between 22 and 35 pounds.


When sitting in the seat, the baby's head should be at least 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the side of the seat. If not, the car seat is too small.
Once the baby weighs more than 35 pounds (or their head is less than 1cm away from the edge of the seat) you will need to upgrade to a bigger car seat.;
, Convertible car seats are a good option if you plan on using the car seat over a couple of years. They can be converted from a rear-facing seat for small infants (weighing up to 40 pounds) to a front facing seat for older infants and toddlers (weighing up to 70 pounds).


Keep in mind that it's best to keep the seat in the rear-facing position for as long as possible, as it is the safest option for your child.Your child will need to be moved to a bigger seat when the top of their ears is level with the top edge of the seat.

, These car seats are best for children who are over the age of four and weigh at least 40 pounds. They are front-facing and use the car's regular seatbelts to secure the child.


The child has outgrown their booster seat when the headrest is set to its highest level and the child's shoulders are two inches above the opening of the straps.
Once the child has outgrown this booster seat, they should be able to sit in the car independently, without the use of a seat.

, Sometimes it's possible to get a baby seat that can easily be removed from the car and attached to a baby stroller. This is very convenient, as you won't need to remove the child from one seat and strap him or her into another. These types of baby seats and strollers are usually sold in a set.

Measure your car so you can buy an appropriately sized seat.,
Shop around to find a good deal.,
Look for a seat that is easy to carry.,
Consider what type of material is covering the seat.,
Test out the seat before buying to make sure your baby/child is comfortable.",How to Choose the Right Car Seat2," It's important to buy a car seat that feats neatly into the back of the car. If the seat is too big you will not be able to secure it properly, which is unsafe for the child. Measure the available space in the back of your car to figure out the maximum possible car seat size.


If possible, test out the car seat before buying to ensure that it fits comfortably into the back of the car. Most stores will be happy to let you do this.Also consider how the size of the seat will affect any other passengers. If you need to fit two more children into the back of the car, you will not want a car seat that takes up too much space and makes them uncomfortable.

, Shop around before buying a car seat to ensure that you find the right one for your needs, at the best possible price. Go to a number of stores to compare car seat styles and prices.


Figure out if you're eligible for any discounts or if you have any coupons that you could use at a particular store.
Shopping online is another option, but it's usually best to see the car seat in person and test to make sure that it fits into your car before you buy. If you do decide to buy online, make sure you check out customer ratings and reviews before you order.
Another good option is to find the car seat that you like in a store (where you can test it out) then see if you can find the exact same car seat online, at a cheaper price.

, When buying an infant car seat, look for one that will be easy to carry. This is important, as you will spend the next few months carrying your baby in and out of your house, into stores and to visit family and friends.


To test out the seat, place something heavy (like a stack of books) into the seat and try carrying it around the store for a few minutes. This will give you a good indication of whether it's comfortable and easy to carry.

, What type of material the car seat is made from is another important consideration. Ideally, you should choose something natural and breathable, like cotton. This will prevent the child from getting too hot and sweaty in their seat.


Additionally, you should choose a material that is smooth and easy to clean. Anything that has grooves or rough weaving (like corduroy) will trap dirt and be more difficult to clean.

, It's a good idea to place your baby or child in the seat before buying to make sure they are secure and comfortable in it. There are several things you should look for:


The baby/child should not be bent or hunched over when the straps/belts have been secured.
The baby/child should be able to move their arms and legs, but in a limited fashion.
The baby/child should be sitting upright, rather than tilted to one side.

Test whether you can easily buckle and unbuckle the child from their seat.,
Learn how to change the position of the car seat.,
Check the history of the car seat.",How to Choose the Right Car Seat3," Make sure that you read the instructions that come with the car seat thoroughly before you attempt to install the seat. This will help you to understand the correct installation method and save you time.


If you cannot follow the instructions or they seem too complicated, ask a friend, family member or even a salesperson at the place where you bought the seat to install the car seat for you.
Do not risk installing the car seat incorrectly, as this could put your child's life at risk in the case of an accident

, Most car seats are secured into the correct position using the car's own seatbelt. The seatbelt usually needs to pass through the base of the seat in a specific way. When installing the car seat, make sure the belt follows the correct path. If it is positioned correctly, you should not be able to move the seat more than an inch in any direction., Check to see whether the car seat's own straps are routed through the right holes, in the right order and in the right direction. If not, there should be diagrams in the instructions to show you how to set them up. Test the position of the straps by placing your child into the seat and looking for the following:


Make sure the straps are tight, but not so tight that they are digging in or causing the child to be hunched over. You should be able to adjust the tightness of the straps easily.
Make sure that the straps follow the correct path, over the child's shoulders and between his or her legs. Make sure that the shoulder straps go across the child's chest and not across his or her neck., Try buckling and unbuckling the child several times until you get the hang if it. This is important, in case you need to remove the child from the seat in a hurry.


However, it's important that the seat is not so easy to unbuckle that the child can do it themselves. This could be very dangerous if the child were to unbuckle themselves while the car was in motion.
Opt for car seats that have two-piece retainer clips, as these are harder to release and your child will not be able to open it by his or herself., Get to know your car seat by practicing how to change it's position. Learn how to adjust the head rest and the straps, practice lifting the seat in and out of the car and be familiar with how to switch the seat from rear-facing to front facing (if you have that kind of seat). Knowing exactly how you child's car seat works will make your life much easier over the coming months/years.

, If you opt for a used car seat, which you've bought second-hand or borrowed from a family member, make sure to check it for damage and ask the previous owner if it was involved in any road accidents in the past. It's extremely important to be aware of any damage the car seat may have sustained.

Make sure the models you look at have 5-point harnesses, as this ensures a better fit which is safer for the child.
Check the straps to make sure they are wide and do not easily twist. Twisted straps reduce the area of strap that would restrain a child during a crash, diminishing the seat's effectiveness.
Look for convertible car seats that have front harness adjustment. If you can adjust the tightness of the harness from the front of the seat, you are more likely to adjust the harness correctly every time the child uses the seat. A snug fitting harness can reduce the chance of injury.
Read the car seat specifications to find out if the seat has additional safety features such as energy absorbing foam or side wings to protect the child's head in the event of a side-impact crash.;
, The 3 general methods include threading a seat belt through the car seat, the Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) system and a top tether.


Look for convertible car seats with a sea belt routing path if you will need to install the car seat through the seat belt threading method.
Choose a car seat that is LATCH compatible if your car supports the LATCH system as this can often provide a tighter, more secure fit. Most vehicles newer than model year 2002 include the LATCH system.
Check for a top tether on the car seat if you would like to use this method of installation in addition to another method to improve the fit of the car seat.

,


Use infant inserts if included with the convertible car seat to make sure the seat is snug enough for a small newborn.
Find a model that includes built-in recline adjustment to make it easier to recline the seat to the 45 degree angle necessary for infants who are riding rear-facing.
Compare the height of different seats and the placement of their shoulder strap slots. Shorter car seats, or seats where the shoulder strap slots are located lower on the seat will not accommodate a taller child as long. Shoulder straps must be at or above a child's shoulders when he or she rides forward-facing.

, The higher the weight limit, the longer you may be able to use the car seat. Pay attention to the rear-facing weight limit for the seat as well, as rear-facing riding is the safest option for infants.

,


Search for a narrower model if you need to use the vehicle's backseat for passengers or if you need to install multiple car seats into the vehicle.
Check that the dimensions of the seats you're considering will fit well in rear-facing and forward-facing positions. Sometimes a seat that fits easily forward-facing may require you to push the front seats all the way towards the front of the car in order for the car seat to fit in the rear-facing position.
Ask to try a display model of the car seat you want to buy in your car before you purchase the seat.
Purchase the convertible car seat from a vendor that has a good return policy if you buy the seat online in case there are problems with vehicle fit once you attempt to install the seat.

, Check to see if the cover is removable, and if so, if it is washable.

, Make a decision based on your budget to purchase the best convertible car seat for your situation.

Learn if your car needs to be adjusted or not.,
Understand the ignition cycle.,
Learn the ignition timing number.,
Hook up your timing light or timing gun.,
Have a helper rev the engine.,
Shine the light directly onto the harmonic balancer and find the number.,
Account for vacuum timing, if necessary.,
Adjust the timing, if necessary.,
Loosen the bolt that secures the engine's distributor enough so that the distributor can be turned.,
Adjust while the engine is at idle speed.,
When in doubt, total timing should be somewhere between 34 and 36 degrees.,
Tighten the distributor bolt when you are satisfied the timing is set correctly.

",How to Adjust Timing," Modern cars that are controlled by electronic ignitions don't need to have their timing adjusted, but old-style 4-stroke engines require that the timing be adjusted periodically to optimize the efficiency of the engine, making sure that the spark fires at the appropriate moment in the ignition cycle.


If you hear telltale signs of the timing of your car not being quite right, such as pinging, backfiring, or if the car runs too rich or too lean, you will need to either take it to a mechanic or adjust the timing yourself.;
, The four ""strokes"" in the 4-cycle engine refer to the process of intake, compression, power, and exhaust. The timing of the ignition refers to the point between the compression and the power strokes at which the spark plug fires, creating the combustion that results in your horsepower, forcing the piston down into the cylinder.When the piston comes up during the compression stroke, just before the piston gets to the top of its compression stroke (which is called ""top dead center""), the spark plug should fire. Over time, this tends to get misaligned somewhat, resulting in a less-than-optimum spark plug firing time. The distance before the ""top dead"" center is the ignition timing, and it's represented by a row of graded numbers on the balancer or flywheel through an access hole.

, Look for the ruler-style row of numbers on the front of the engine's harmonic balancer (or flywheel), which should have numbers above and below zero. Typically, when your car comes from the manufacturer, ignition base idle timing is set to a manufacture specification before top dead center. The timing advances as the engine's speed accelerates, however, resulting in a variable that will need to be periodically adjusted using a timing light.


Numbers to the left of zero on the timing tape refer to the piston as it travels down, while numbers to the right of zero refer to the piston's upward motion. Moving the wheel right is called ""advancing"" the timing, while moving the wheel left is ""moving back"" the timing.

, Hook your timing gun up to the power and ground terminals on your car's battery, and hook the sensor that accompanies the timing gun to your number one cylinder spark plug wire. Follow the instructions particular to the timing light you're using to hook it up properly.


The ""gun"" works by illuminating the timing marks in a strobe fashion as it spins, allowing you to see the point at which the spark plug is firing on the timing index. When the spark plug fires, the sensor sends a signal to the light, which strobes in the gun, illuminating the numbers at the proper moment.

, To check your timing number and see how it is firing, have someone rev the engine while you illuminate the timing numbers with your light. You obviously want to make sure the car is in neutral, and keep your hands a safe distance from the engine as it revs.

, Though the wheel is turning, the light should seem to ""freeze"" it at a particular number. This is the timing number. Note the number of degrees to the right or left of zero.


As the RPMs increase, the point at which the spark plug is firing should also increase somewhat. This is normal, because ignition works on a curve, allowing for the speed increase and adjusting the timing accordingly.
To check for total timing, you want to be sure to rev the engine to at least 3500 RPMs. This will allow you to make sure the curve of the ignition timing is being set, as well as the initial timing.

, If your car features vacuum timing advance in addition to mechanical timing, and you'll need to loosen the distributor adjustment bolt before you start the engine. Next, remove the vacuum advance hose from the carburetor and plug it with a rag to check your timing.


Vacuum timing works by making minor adjustments at at low RPM by rotating slightly to adjust for the timing.

, Now that you've found your ignition timing number, how do you know if you need to adjust it? All models of cars will have differing timing values, depending on the year it was manufactured and the variety of transmission used. To learn whether or not you need to adjust your timing, find the optimum timing number for your make and model and adjust if necessary.


If you don't know your timing number, talk to a licensed mechanic or employee at your local auto parts store to consult their manuals and find the proper timing number.

, To adjust your timing, all you need to do is turn the distributor housing one direction or the other, depending on whether or not you want to advance or move back the timing.


If the rotor turns clockwise, you'll advance the timing by rotating the distributor counterclockwise, and vice versa. It'll take some touch to get it right, so it helps to have someone to rev the engine, check the number, and twist the distributor.

, Grab the distributor firmly and rotate it slowly to one side or the other. Continue rotating until the timing mark is in the correct position. Align the timing marks by continuing to move the distributor and checking with your timing light. When you've got it set where you want it, lock it back down by tightening the distributor bolts.Reconnect vacuum hoses.

, A typical small-block Chevy's timing curve needs to be set somewhere in this range for maximum performance, when the engine is being revved at 3500 RPM. At this point, the timing should stop advancing and should remain steady.Total timing minus your base timing number should meet your engine specification for total advance degrees. If the number is not as specified then you may have a distributor mechanical advance problem.

, Use either a clean sheet of paper or soft cloth, and hold it between the anvil and the spindle. Gently twist and close on the sheet or cloth. Slowly, pull out the sheet or the cloth.This practice isn't a necessary step for measuring, but keeping the surfaces of the anvil and spindle clean ensures precise measurements.

, The anvil is stationary and can withstand more pressure than the spindle. Make sure the object doesn't move or scratch the surface of the anvil.

, The frame will rest gently on your palm.


You can also fasten the frame on a stationary vise; this helps free up both hands for the measuring process.

, Be sure the 0 on the thimble is lined up with the scale on the sleeve.

, Apply enough force. The thimble often clicks. Three clicks is a good stopping point.

, Even though it is on lock, the spindle can still be moved.

, Be sure to avoid scratching either surfaces of the anvil or spindle; the slightest scratch can ruin the micrometers measuring accuracy.

, If the spindle loosens, be sure to remeasure.

Mount accurately.,
Check the ""B"" pillar of a model with the shoulder belts already installed.,
Add floor mountings.,
Do something similar with the shoulder belts, just make sure they are round.,
Fit the rear belts, depending on their length, could be mounted at the same spot as the lap belt.,
Consider another point if needed.,
Some may consider it sacrilege, but view it as being the same as installing turn signals on cars prior to 1955.",How to Add in Seatbelts to Vintage Cars," The front belts would have to be mounted on the ""B"" pillar, or on the upper door frame if it was a hardtop. You would have to do some beefing up in the mounting area, especially in the case of the hardtop.;
, You might be able use the bits from that car in the one you want to install the belts.

, The floor mountings should be no problems, as Chrysler had the floors drilled for belts, front and rear, from at least 1962. For example, the 1965 Valiant has plates with a threaded bolt welded in place where the belts go (it only has front belts, but these plates are in the rear as well). The 1962 Valiant and Lancer have the holes front and rear with belts only on the front. There are no mounting plates, but the belts have a nut and bolt arrangement with a large round ""washer"" inside and out. The one under the floor is about 3"" in diameter. The ""washer"" takes the strain in the case of an accident and spreads it over a larger area.

, The corners of square or rectangular ones could cut through the floor, or whatever panel the belts are mounted, in an accident. Welding these plates/washers in place would also strengthen the support.

, Or, you could drill a hole through the floor in the area over the axle. This spot is higher than the floor where the seat is, and thus you would not need such a long belt. Also, the steel is thicker - just use a plate to add extra strength to the mounting point.

, You could try the wheelhouse, on a flat area. Again that would mean a shorter belt, but would need those plates to add more strength to the mounting point.

, They are a safety feature, and given the traffic these days, perhaps a safety necessity.

Learn the different number scales on the thimbles.On the sleeve is a scale that measures by the one-hundred thousands or 1/10 of an inch; in decimal form it would be .100.,
Read the whole number on the sleeve first.,
Read how many lines come after the whole number.,
Find the number and corresponding marking on the thimble scale closest to but underneath the measurement line on the stock.,
Add those three numbers together.,
Flip the micrometer over to read to the 10 thousandths marking.",How to Use and Read an Outside Micrometer2,"
In between those whole numbers are three lines that represent twenty-five thousandths of an inch; in decimal form, it would look like .025.
The thimble has evenly spaced lines that represent one-thousandth of an inch; in decimal form it would be .001.
Above the whole number scale on the sleeve are lines that measure to ten-thousandths of an inch; in decimal form it looks like .0001.

, The last visible number will read as the thousandths. For example, if the last number you can see on the sleeve is 5, then it would read 5 hundred thousandths, or .500. ”

, Look at the individual markings exposed next to the 100 thousandths and multiply each marking by .25.. In this case 1 x .025 would be .025.

, If it's closest to 1, then it would be .001.

, In this case it would be .500 + .025 + .001 = .526.

, Read that line that lines closest with the sleeve. If, for example, it lines with 1, then the measurement will will read .5261

Learn the different number scales on the thimbles.The line on the sleeve usually has top line showing millimeters, and below that line the marks represent half millimeters.,
Read the number of millimeters first.,
Incorporate all the half millimeters in your measurement.,
Find the number of .01 millimeters.,
Add up all three lines.,
Add the thousandths.",How to Use and Read an Outside Micrometer3,"
The marks on the thimble usually go to 50, and each line represents a hundredth of a millimeter or .01 mm.
The horizontal lines above the scale on the sleeve will measure to the thousandth of a millimeter, or .001 mm.

, If the last line you saw were a 5, then you would have 5 mm thus far.

, If you have one mark that would be .5 mm.


Don't count a mark that is barely showing; the reading on the thimble might be getting close to 50. , If the line on the thimble reads 33, then you'd have .33 mm.

, In this example, add 5 + .5 + .33. The measurement is 5.83 mm.

, If the thousandths read a 6, then at .006 to the measurement. In this example, it would be 5.836


The main time you should incorporate the thousandths measurement is if the object has less tolerance for the pressure applied by the micrometer."

Most of these certifications have a specific experience requirement you will need to meet before you are awarded your certification. The most common ASE certification for automotive repair is the G1 exam for Auto Maintenance and Light Repair.There are many more certifications one can pursue after completing their G1 certification.
The G1 test requires a minimum of two years of hands on experience.
There are series of tests that cover things like collision repair all the way to repairing school buses.;
, You will need to find an entry level technician job in order to gain the necessary experience to become ASE certified. Create a professional resume that lays out your experience. If you do not have any automotive experience, list any professional experience you do have when writing your resume.Be sure to include your name and contact information on the resume.
Make sure you list your experience and education clearly.
Have a friend proofread your resume to help ensure there are no spelling or grammatical errors.

, Look online for entry level automotive repair technician jobs on websites like Monster.com and Indeed.com. You may also want to look in the classified sections of your local newspapers.Many jobs will require that you complete an application online. Pay close attention to ensure you don’t miss any questions.
Make sure you dress appropriately when you go in for your interviews.

, While you can complete the ASE certification exam before you complete the experience requirements, you will not receive the certification until you have worked in the field for at least two years.You do not have to complete all of the required experience at the same location.
The experience must be hands on and pertinent to automotive repair.

, There are many technical and vocational schools that offer training specifically designed to prepare you to pass the ASE certification exams, but most require a high school diploma or GED certificate in order to enroll.Locate your high school diploma or GED certificate to be able to prove to the school you apply to that you are eligible to enroll.
If you do not have a diploma or GED, earn your GED to fulfill the requirements.

, You can enroll in online courses that prepare you for the ASE exams, or you can choose to attend a school in person. Often, attending classes in person will provide you with hands on experience that you may not get through your job. Online courses may be easier to attend if there isn’t a local technical school or if your schedule makes attending classes difficult.Consider how you prefer to learn when deciding between attending classes online or in person.
Online courses will require more self-discipline, as you won’t be seeing a teacher to hold you accountable for your work.

, There are many schools that offer ASE certification programs. The first step toward narrowing the list of schools down is to identify which programs near you or online are accredited. Most schools will provide that information on their webpage, or you can contact the admissions department to ask about accreditation.You can also search for the schools near you on websites like this: http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/

Make a list of the local or online programs you think you may want to apply to.

, Once you have a list of the schools you may want to apply to, consider what the cost of attendance will be. Ask your admissions counselor if the school offers financial aid, and make sure to complete and file your FAFSA in order to receive federal student aid.Make sure to consider the cost of any necessary supplies or expenses associated with commuting if you are going to attend classes in person.
Consider whether or not your computer can support your online course load, otherwise the cost of a computer will need to be considered as well.

, Once you have chosen one or a small number of programs you will like to apply to and can afford to attend, submit your application prior to the school’s designated deadline for the course.The school’s admissions counselors can help ensure you know when the deadlines are and what you need to submit.
Make a note of anything you need to find, like your high school diploma, and make sure you locate and submit them prior to the deadlines.

, Whether you attend class online or in person, you will need to cover a wide variety of topics in preparation for the ASE test. Be prepared to learn automotive terminology, the various parts of a vehicle, and common repair or maintenance techniques.If you take the courses online, you will likely need to participate in forums or discussions, as well as submitting normal coursework.
Online classes will use pictures of different automotive components while some schools you attend in person will have actual vehicles to demonstrate on.

, You must first register for the ASE test before you can choose a location and a date to take it. You can register online by going to https://www.ase.com/Tests/ASE-Certification-Tests/Register-Now.aspx and creating a MyASE account.Check on the ASE website for the registration deadline for the current and upcoming season.
Registration deadlines may not be the same from year to year.

, After registering online, use the website to locate an ASE testing facility near you. You can then schedule an appointment through the ASE website to take your exam or you may call the facility directly to schedule a test date.It may take up to a day for your online registration to process on the ASE website.
If you do not schedule your test date within 90 days, you will have to register online again.
You can choose to schedule to take multiple tests in a series if you are prepared to pursue a specialization like alternate fuels, heavy trucks, or damage analysis.

, The cost to register online is $36, with an additional $37 to schedule your exam. These fees are subject to change from year to year, so make sure to refer to the ASE website to find the most up to date costs associated with the examination..


If you are planning on taking additional, more specialized, ASE certification exams, each one will have another fee associated with it.
No matter how many certifications you take, the exam fees max out at $111.

, Upon arriving to your testing location, you will be given the exam and an allotted amount of time to complete it. There are sixty questions on most ASE tests and you will be given an hour and fifteen minutes to complete it. Make sure you are clear on how much time you have for your exam before you begin.Recertification tests require only twenty-five questions and must be completed within thirty minutes.
Some advanced certifications may require a different number of questions in a different amount of time.

, Because ASE certification tests are done on a computer, the results will be processed immediately. You will receive your score and know whether or not you have attained your certification prior to leaving the test facility.If you did not pass the exam, you will need to schedule another test date to retake the test.
If you have not completed the work experience required for the certification, you will not receive your certificate until after you have fulfilled the requirement.

Check the tread depth on your tires regularly.,
Ensure your tires are properly inflated.,
Inspect your serpentine or accessory belts for signs of damage.,
Check your oil level regularly.,
Ensure your vehicle has enough coolant and brake fluid.,
Test your headlights, tail lights and turn signals.,
Take immediate action if you see a dashboard warning light.,
Keep your vehicle battery clean and secure.",How to Understand the Basics of Car Maintenance1," Tires come in many shapes and sizes, and depending on the application, the type and depth of the tread can vary. Most tires now come with tread wear lines that cross the tire perpendicular to the grooves of the tread. Once the tread wears down to the point that the tread wear lines are even with the tread, your tires need to be replaced.Another common method to check tread wear is to press an upside down penny into the groove between treads. If you can see all of Abraham Lincoln’s head, the tread is too worn down.
Driving on tires with treads that are too worn can result in blowing out a tire or losing traction in the rain.;
, Your tires were designed to operate with a specific amount of air pressure inside them. Driving on tires that are underinflated can do damage to the sidewalls of the tires, causing them to rupture and deflate. Look on the side of the tire on your vehicle for the maximum pressure rating for the tire, then fill it to match. Place a tire gauge on the tire’s valve stem to see if the tires require air, then use an air compressor to inflate your tires if need be.Under inflated tires can also dramatically reduce your gas mileage, as the vehicle works harder to propel you on soft tires.
Over inflated tires can also be more prone to blow outs and will reduce the life span of your tire.

, Your engine powers its accessories like the power steering pump, air conditioning and alternator using belts driven by the crank pulley. These belts can wear out or become damaged if a pulley goes bad or they rub on something in the engine bay. Visually inspect these belts for signs of cracking, rubbing or other damage. If the belt appears to be damaged, it must be replaced.If your vehicle is equipped with a timing belt, it could cause significant damage to your engine if it breaks.
If you notice signs of rubbing, you will need to move what was rubbing it when you replace the belt to ensure it doesn’t occur again.

, To check your oil, locate the dipstick in your vehicle. The top of a dipstick is often bright yellow and easily identified, but if you have trouble finding it, refer to the owner’s manual for your vehicle. Pull the dipstick out and wipe off the oil on it. Look at the clean dipstick so you can easily identify the full line, then slide it back into the engine. Remove it once more and look at the level the oil reaches on the stick.If your dipstick has multiple lines, the top one indicates “full” and each line below it represents a quart of oil that needs to be added.
If your oil levels are low, it may be because of an oil leak. Fill it back up and check it frequently to determine if there is an issue with oil leaking or burning in your vehicle.

, Under the hood you will find both a coolant and a brake fluid reservoir. These plastic containers will have lines in them that represent how much fluid should be in each. If they are below the full line, you should top them off to ensure your vehicle never runs without either. Refer to your owner’s manual to help you identify the reservoirs and choose the proper fluid to replace them with, per the manufacturer’s recommendations.Coolant travels through your engine to help regulate engine temperatures.
Your vehicle uses brake fluid to engage the brakes when you press on the pedal. Low brake fluid could cause your vehicle to brake erratically or fail to brake at all.

, Your headlights are essential to seeing at night and your tail lights and turn signals help ensure other drivers see you and understand your intentions. It’s important that all of these lights are functioning properly at all times. Have a friend stand outside of your car as you test each light to ensure they are working.Replace any lights that blow out as soon as possible.
If one of your turn signals begins to flash faster than normal, it is likely because the coinciding turn signal on the other end of the vehicle has blown out.

, Most vehicles come equipped with a number of warning lights that can let you know if there is an issue that needs to be addressed. These symbols are fairly universal regardless of auto maker and can warn you about things like low tire pressure, excessive engine temperature or an issue with your anti-lock brake system. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to see each symbol and what it represents so you can take the proper action when a light comes on.If a light comes on that you are unsure of, pull over and turn off the vehicle until you are able to identify the issue.
If you do not have an owner’s manual, try referring to the auto maker’s website or a site like http://dashboardsymbols.com/the-symbols


, Most modern automotive batteries require very little maintenance, but you can prolong the life of your battery with a few simple steps. Make sure the terminals of the battery are clean and free from corrosion and check to ensure the strap securing the battery is tight. Some batteries may require that you check the fluid levels in the battery and add to it if need be.The vibrations caused by an unsecured battery can reduce the lifespan of the battery.
Make sure the terminals are free of corrosion to ensure a proper connection.

Change the oil every 3,000 miles, or as directed in your owner’s manual.,
Rotate your tires every 6,000 miles.,
Replace your brake pads every 20,000 miles or as needed.,
Put in new spark plugs every 30,000 miles.,
Replace your air filter every 45,000 miles.,
Install a new fuel filter every 60,000 miles.,
Drain and flush your coolant system every two to five years.,
Install new windshield wipers as needed.",How to Understand the Basics of Car Maintenance2," Motor oil is the lubricant that keeps your engine running smoothly. Running your engine without enough oil or oil that has broken down over time can result in significant damage to your engine. Some vehicles do not require oil changes every 3,000 miles, so refer to your owner’s manual to see what the manufacturer recommends for your vehicle. To change your oil, remove the oil drain plug from the bottom of the oil pan and drain the oil into a container. Replace the oil filter and refill the engine with the correct amount of oil as listed in your owner’s manual. When you change your oil, you should always replace your oil filter as well.
Check your owner’s manual for the proper oil capacity to ensure you fill the engine up with the correct amount of oil.

, You can increase the lifespan of your tires by rotating them regularly. To rotate your tires, simply switch them from one side to the other, the front to the back, or both. The position your wheel is in in relation to the car affects how the tread will wear down, so rotating your tires to different locations on the car will ensure the tread wears down evenly, whereas leaving them in one place may cause one area of the tire to wear down more quickly than others.Rotating your tires can make your tires last significantly longer.
You will not need to remove the tires from the wheels, instead simply bolt the wheel and tire together to a different corner of the car.

, There are a number of variables that come into play when determining how often to replace your brake pads. Aggressive driving, softer compound brake pads, or frequently driving in traffic can all reduce the lifespan of your pads. Most brake pads come equipped with a small piece of metal that will rub on the rotor when the pads are too low. This causes your brakes to squeak and squeal. If you notice your brakes making a high pitched noise, they likely need to be replaced.Always replace the pads on both sides of the car at once. Never replace just one brake pad.
Your front brakes will need to be replaced more often than your rears, as they do the majority of the work to stop the vehicle.

, Spark plugs ignite the mixture of air and fuel inside your engine to produce power, but over time they can become corroded. Corroded spark plugs have a limited ability to ignite the air/fuel mixture and can cause your engine to misfire or run poorly. A failed spark plug may result in that cylinder of your car ceasing to fire at all. Use a spark plug wrench to remove old spark plugs and replace them with matching new ones. You may need to adjust the gap between the spark plug and the prong sticking out of it using a spark plug gapping tool. You can find the proper gap measurement in your vehicle’s service manual.
Make sure to purchase the right spark plugs for your specific year, make and model vehicle. Ask an employee at your local auto parts store to look up the correct spark plugs for your application.

, Your engine requires a good source of air as much as it needs gasoline to function, and over time your air filter can become clogged with dust, dirt and oil. Replacing your air filter every 45,000 miles can ensure your engine continues to run properly. Locate your air box by referring to your vehicle’s owner’s manual, then unlatch the clips to gain access to the air filter. Remove the old one and drop a new one into the air box in its place.A clogged up air filter can reduce your gas mileage and the amount of power the vehicle produces.
Some aftermarket air filters can be cleaned every 45,000 miles instead of being replaced.

, Gasoline is often quite dirty, and the sediment would clog up your fuel system and prevent the car from running without a fuel filter. The filter is often located just past the fuel pump on the underside of the vehicle. When functioning properly, it prevents dirt and grime from reaching the fuel system in your engine. Of course, over time this filter will get clogged too, preventing fuel from reaching your engine at all. To change your fuel filter, remove the two plastic clips holding the filter in place and slide a new one in every 60,000 miles to prevent this from occurring., Like oil, coolant can eventually go bad. When coolant goes bad, its ability to regulate the temperature of your engine becomes compromised and your vehicle may overheat. Combat this by draining your coolant system, flushing it with a hose, then filling it up with a new coolant and water mixture every two to five years.If You drive your vehicle aggressively or in harsh conditions, you should drain and flush your coolant more often.
If your vehicle has been running unusually hot or cold, it is likely due to coolant that needs to be replaced.
If you break the plastic clips that hold the fuel filter in place, you can purchase new ones at your local auto parts store. Your replacement filter may have even come with some.
You will need to jack the car up to gain access to the fuel filter in most vehicles.

, Your windshield wipers may not seem like an important part of vehicle maintenance, but worn out wipers can put you in danger if you find yourself in a heavy rain storm. As your windshield wipers wear out, they will begin to fail to displace the water on the windshield. Prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures can cause windshield wipers to wear out prematurely.Make sure to look for the correct size windshield wipers for your year, make and model vehicle.
It is not uncommon for your vehicle to require two different sized windshield wipers.

Review your owner’s manual.,
Contact the service manager at your local dealership.,
Get quotes from other trusted dealerships or shops.,
Schedule a service appointment.,
Consider service recommendations made by the dealership.",How to Understand the Basics of Car Maintenance3," Every vehicle comes with a list of service recommendations to ensure it continues to operate properly. You may be able to address a number of these things, but some many be beyond your level of mechanical expertise. Check in your owner’s manual for service recommendations, then choose which ones you feel you can handle on your own.Some vehicles require timing chain or belt replacements every certain number of miles. This may require removing the engine from the vehicle itself and should not be ignored. Failing to properly maintain your timing chain or belt could result in serious damage to the engine.

, Once you have identified a maintenance service you’d like to have done to your vehicle, contact the local dealership for your make of vehicle and ask to speak to the service manager. Ask for a quote on what conducting the necessary service may cost. The service manager should be able to provide you with a fairly reliable quote, as they likely conduct regular maintenance on vehicles like yours often.The dealership that specializes in your brand of vehicle is the most likely to have the tools and expertise required for difficult maintenance tasks.
Some dealerships may provide a loner vehicle to drive while they work on your vehicle.

, You may also want to get service quotes from other dealerships in the area specializing in your make of vehicle, or even from local garages. Some small garages may not have the equipment necessary to do specialized jobs on uncommon cars, but they can often fulfil most service requests.Don’t always opt for the least expensive quote. Try looking up the shops you are considering online to read reviews from previous customers.

, Once you’ve chosen the place you’d like to conduct the maintenance on your vehicle, call them again to schedule an appointment to bring your car in. Remove any personal belongings from your vehicle before leaving it at the dealership for service.Make sure you know whether or not you can wait for your vehicle there or if you should make arrangements for a ride.
Depending on the nature of the job, it may take hours or days to complete the maintenance on your vehicle.

, When you bring your vehicle in, the service manager or techs may point out other issues they have identified over the course of conducting the maintenance, or offer suggestions for other things you may want to address while your car is already there. You do not have to permit them to do any additional work, so consider what they suggest and make a determination based on your own finances and what’s best for the vehicle.Some things recommended by the service manager or techs may be issues that should be addressed immediately, while others may be something you can resolve later on.
Never feel pressured to pay for additional services that you do not want.

Determine if you have any refrigerant left in your system at all.,
Check for any obvious leaks.,
Make sure the condensing coils are not obstructed with debris, and that the compressor is operating.,
Tap your refrigerant can.,
Securely thread the tapping valve on the refrigerant can, close the valve completely shut.,
Purge the charging hose.,
Locate the low pressure charging port on the refrigerant line on your car.,
Crank your engine and turn the AC on high cool, high fan.,
Open the valve until you hear refrigerant passing through the hose.

,
Allow the can to dispense its contents.,
Close the valve and disconnect the hose when the can is empty or no longer discharging enough to keep the can cold.,
Check the air from the AC vents in the car.",How to Recharge the Air Conditioner in a Car," To do this, you will need to fit a charging hose on the low pressure port, which is on the refrigerant line on your car, usually near the accumulator. Be sure to use eye protection. If your system is completely discharged, it may be contaminated with moisture, and charging will not give satisfactory results unless the source of the leak is found, repaired, and the receiver dryer is replaced. The open system must be repaired and purged using a vacuum pump to remove air and moisture. You will also want to add compressor oil if the system has been leaking. Evidence of oil leakage and measurement of oil left in a replaced compressor will be a guide as to how much oil to replace.;
, If your system has lost sufficient refrigerant to quit working, you have a leak. Small leaks may take months to deplete the refrigerant so that the AC fails to cool, but charging a system with a significant leak is simply a waste of time. Look for refrigerant oil residue on hose, tubing, and fittings that are part of the refrigerant system. Spray a soapy water solution on fittings and watch for bubbles to appear, indicating a leak.

, To test a compressor with a low charge you may need to jump the pressure switch, often located on the accumulator.

, This is done by completely opening the valve on the tapping fitting, which retracts the tapping pin into the valve body. Failing to do so will result in the tap puncturing the can when it is installed, releasing the refrigerant before the fitting is sealed.

, This drives the pin into the top of the can, making it possible to release the refrigerant when the valve is opened.

, Open the valve until you hear it fill with refrigerant, then slowly loosen the brass fitting that connects the hose to the valve. Be careful not to allow refrigerant to spray on bare skin, as this will freeze skin tissue on contact. Re-tighten the hose once you have heard refrigerant escaping; this should have forced any air (and moisture) from the hose.

, This will be on the larger tube, usually near or on the accumulator. Connect the quick coupling and make sure it is not leaking.

, If your recharging hose is equipped with a pressure gauge, check it to determine if the system needs refrigerant. If the pressure holds steady in the recommended range, the system is full and should not be charged. If the pressure is below the recommended range, follow the instructions to recharge the system.


Another indicator that the system needs refrigerant is that the compressor cycles rapidly. If the compressor switches on and off every 5 to 20 seconds, it is most likely due to low pressure. You will see the pressure drop when the compressor kicks on, the compressor will shut off when the pressure gets too low, and the pressure rises back up to the operating range as the system equalizes. Compressor cycling (switching on and off) in a completely charged system should be very slow (every 30 seconds or up) or not at all present (compressor stays on) in hot weather.
Be aware if the cooling fans for the radiator are on and functioning with while the AC system is on. If the compressor is on, the cooling fans should also be on to assist in cooling the freon in the condenser, located either in front or behind the radiator. Most vehicles have 2 fans, with one being dedicated to the AC system

,, This often takes anywhere from two to five minutes. The hotter the outside temperature, the more quickly the contents will discharge. Keep the can with the tap up at all times, to allow non-liquid refrigerant into the suction side of the system to prevent compressor damage. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart.

, Check the charging port for leaks, and replace the plastic cap.

, It should be blowing cold (38-45 degrees), if not, either one can of refrigerant was not sufficient to charge the system, or some other component is the problem. Do Not overcharge! A manifold gauge should be used to measure both high and low side pressure. Consult a Pressure temperature chart.

If you put the key in the ignition, turn it, and check if the dashboard lights up. If you do, there is at least some charge in the battery--a good sign.
If there is no sound, (no start-up motor noise or no ticking) with turning the key and no lights on the dash, you most likely have a completely dead battery. Stop and get help in jumping the battery. No amount of starting will start the car unless the battery issue is resolved.
Turn the key and try to start the engine. Hopefully, it will start up with or without some hesitation. Hesitation is fine--it does not hurt the engine.
If there is a ticking but with no engine turnover there may not be quite enough battery power to start the ignition. Stop at this point, because the battery is too drained to start properly.
If the engine fails to crank, wait a couple of minutes and try again. Sometimes this will allow some residual charge to build in the battery, and possibly enough to start the engine.

, If your car does not start after ten to twenty seconds of cranking, stop and wait for a minute or two before attempting to start again. This gives the battery time to recover, and it will have warmed a bit. Mostly, it allows the starter motor to cool down.


If the car is coming close to starting, but seems sluggish, give it a break and try again. If the battery won't make any effort to turn the engine over, it is discharged and you're going to need to jump it.
If after trying many times the starter is still sluggish, you may need to heat up the battery. You can do this by removing it and bringing it inside, but be aware you may have a fault indication for a while after it is reinstalled. You will not harm the vehicle by removing the battery. From very cold weather, it may take up to 2 hours to warm the battery sufficiently to increase its available amperage.

, Almost every vehicle today has cold-starting instructions in the Operator's Manual that instruct you to use a small amount of throttle to help with a cold start. Refer to your vehicle's Operator's Manual for further information.


If you do not have the owner's manual for your car, you can order one from a car dealer, find one at a salvage yard or look for one at an auto parts chain.
You can also find many owner's manuals online. Try typing in ""car owner manual"" into a reputable search engine and look for relevant results.

, Depress the accelerator once and then release it. This will dispense a small amount of fuel into the intake, which can help get things going. Note that there is no need to do this with fuel-injected engines. If your car is newer than about 1990, it has electronic fuel injection.

, If the starter won't turn over at all, your battery is probably dead. It's now time for a jump-start. You will need a set of jumper cables and a willing volunteer with a running car to complete the jump.

, You'll want the front ends of the cars facing each other, if possible.

, Look for the + and - symbols on the jumper cables and connect the one with the + symbol to the positive terminals on both the running car and the car with the dead battery. Attach the cable with the - symbol to the negative terminals.


An easy way to remember how to hook up the jumper cables is to remember ""red-dead, red-alive."" Hook up the red clamp to the red post on the dead battery, then the red clamp to the red post on the running car, and then do the opposite for the black clamps. The black post to the ""alive"" car and lastly the black clamp to the ""dead"" car. Please note that the black clamp on the ""dead"" car must be connected either an unpainted engine bolt or the mounting bracket of the alternator, not the battery terminal itself. This is to avoid a short circuit.

, When you are about to start the car with the dead battery, it may be helpful to rev the running car a bit. 2000 RPM is plenty.

, If it doesn't work on the first try, double-check to make sure the jumper cables are connected properly (especially the negative/black cable if not connected to the battery) before letting the running car run for a while and trying again.

, Since modern cars have alternators, they are able to maintain charging voltage even at idle RPM. There is no need to rev the engine., At some point in every car's lifetime, its battery must be replaced. This is because car batteries have a limited service life, and no amount of maintenance or care can reverse the effects of chemicals on metal.Car batteries typically last about four years.


If you're changing your car battery yourself, ensure your vehicle is turned off and in park, with the emergency brake set.
Always wear gloves and safety glasses when changing the battery of a car, as car batteries contain potentially hazardous acids and gases, which can be released if the battery is mishandled. You should also make sure that your car battery is recycled using the correct procedures, you can do this by bringing your used battery to a local recycling center, or to certain repair shops.

, An engine block heater is a small heating device installed in the engine that plugs into a wall socket. It warms the engine and oil and eases start-up. Engine block heaters are not expensive, but they must be installed properly by a mechanic., Your car's battery can deliver much more power when it's warm. You can do this using a battery wrap.


A battery wrap or blanket is usually a fixed installation of insulation and heating element around the battery. They require about an hour to sufficiently warm the battery.

, Parking indoors, in a garage, helps to shelter a car's engine from icy winds and freezing temperatures. Heat the garage, if possible, to keep the temperature warmer.

, In the extreme cold, oil thickens and doesn't flow quickly to vital engine parts that need lubrication. A lightweight, winter-grade oil flows easier in cold weather and increases fuel economy.Your owner's manual should tell you the ideal type of oil you should use.

, Gas line antifreeze, also known as dry gas, is a chemical (essentially Methyl Hydrate) that is added to your gas tank to inhibit your gas line freezing. If your gas line freezes, your car will not be able to start until it thaws. Many gas stations already add an anti-freeze agent into their gas during colder weather months. Check with your station of choice and see if this is their practice.


Add dry gas to your petrol or gas fill-up before filling the tank (if possible) to ensure it mixes completely in the tank.

, A fuel conditioner is a multi-functional diesel fuel additive. A diesel engine will start better in the cold if you use fuel conditioner, which prevents the fuel from ""gelling"" and ensures reliable fuel performance in severe winter conditions.

, Condensation on the walls of a gas tank will form and will eventually sink to the bottom and cause freezing problems in your fuel lines. It's much more difficult to start a cold car with a mostly-empty tank, so do yourself a favor and gas up often in the winter before letting the car sit.

, Wiper blades crack in the cold and become much less effective, which can be dangerous in inclement weather. Low visibility can make driving in cold weather extremely dangerous, so it's important to make sure the wiper blades are up in tip-top shape. Replace them every 6 months or so.

, Extreme shifts in temperature affects the pressure of your tires, and driving on tires with inadequate pressure in them can be quite dangerous. Cold tires will read differently than tires that have been warmed, so you'll want to drive around a bit before checking the pressure at the gas station or at the tire shop.


If you live in a place with heavy snowfall, consider putting snow tires on your car, or purchasing a set of chains to use in bad weather. Check your local laws on the use of chains however, as they are illegal in some regions due to the risk of damage to the road surface.

, Winter is tough on batteries, for two main reasons. The battery cannot produce its normal amount of power because of the cold. The chemical reactions that generate electricity are slower at a lower temperatures.Checking your car battery from time to time will help you stay on top of any maintenance issues, but be aware that most car batteries only last between three and five years.

In addition, engines are harder to turn over because the oil inside them is thicker. This demands more amperage from a battery. Multi-viscosity oils, such as 10W30, though, alleviate most of this impact.

Check the battery cables and clamps for fraying or corrosion. If there's a white, powdery substance around the clamps, that's corrosion from battery acid. You can clean it off easily with baking soda, water and a toothbrush.
Your battery contains a liquid electrolyte, which can evaporate and spill so make sure it has enough inside. Most batteries have caps on top, and you can check the level by removing the caps. If it's low, fill the holes with distilled water, being careful not to fill past any fill level indicator or the bottom of the cap.

Use aluminum foil for an easy, low-cost method for removing rust from chrome.,
Clean the chrome.,
Dip aluminum foil into water.,
Rub the aluminum foil over the rust spots.,
Stop every so often to remove the rust residue.,
Rinse the surface of the chrome.,
Dry the chrome completely.",How to Remove Rust from Chrome1," Aluminum reacts with rust chemically, resulting in a material that can be easily wiped or scrubbed off. Since aluminum is softer than most metals, it will not scratch the surface of the chrome or the metal underneath it., Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome, clean dirt and debris from the metal using soapy water, or with car wash soap if cleaning painted car parts. This helps you locate and access rusty areas more easily.


For very dirty or very rusty surfaces, use vinegar or another mild acid suggested below, then follow up with foil.

, You can use any water, but saltwater is best, since the electrolytes and salts will help speed up the chemical process. Tear off strips of aluminum convenient to use on the rusted area.

, Rub the aluminum foil back and forth over the rust spots. You do not need to use much pressure, although heavily rusted areas may require slightly more effort and a longer rubbing time.


Dip the aluminum foil in water again whenever it gets dry.
If you are working on a severely pitted surface then try wadding up the piece of aluminum foil. The edges that this creates will help to smooth down the metal and will actually fill in the pitted rust areas.

, Whenever the rust residue gets too thick, stop and wipe the residue using a rag or towel. This way you can see the remaining rust and continue rubbing it with the aluminum foil.

, Once you have removed all the rust, wipe the surface using a rag to reveal the shiny metal underneath.

, Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces, and can cause further rust of the metal below. Use a paper towel or blow dryer to dry the surface. If necessary, consult the section on follow-up care to repair damage and prevent further rust.


Be sure to apply a coat of polish or wax on your clean chrome to prevent more rust from forming.

Use cola, lime juice, or other mild household acids.,
Clean the chrome.,
Soak or cover the chrome with the acid.,
Wipe or scrub the rust off.,
Wash off residue with a safe soap.,
Dry and care for the car.",How to Remove Rust from Chrome2," Any cola or soda that includes phosphoric acid in the ingredients can be used to remove rust. Other options include lime juice or vinegar. These mild acids can remove rust without significant risk to the surrounding metal.


Diet cola does not have sugar in it, so the process will be less sticky. However, the sugar does help the acid to adhere to the rust.
Avoid strong or concentrated acids, which can etch and weaken the underlying metal. If these household acids are ineffective, try again with phosphoric acid, but keep a fan on to blow corrosive fumes away from your face.

, Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal. Use car wash soap to clean painted surfaces on cars, and regular soapy water for other chrome objects.

, Ideally, soak the object for 15 minutes before removing. If you cannot soak the object, then simply pour the mild acid over the surface.

, You may need to use a rough sponge or gentle dish scrubber to remove the dissolved rust. Scrubbers designed for use on glass cookware tend to have the lowest risk of scratching your chrome. To remove heavy rust, rub gently with strips of aluminum foil or scrub with scouring pads.

, If you are cleaning a car, use car wash soap to remove the rust and acid residue. Dish soap should not be used on painted car surfaces, since it may strip the paint. Unpainted surfaces can be cleaned using any ordinary soap and water.

, Remove moisture with paper towels to minimize further rust. If the rust has caused noticeable damage, refer to the section on follow up care.


Apply a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to prevent rust from forming in the future.

Use chrome polish for the quickest removal, or oil to save money.,
Clean the chrome using soapy water.,
Apply oil or chrome polish to the rusted area.,
Apply oil or chrome polish to brass wool or fine steel wool.,
Rub the wool gently over the rusted area.,
Rinse the area with clean water.,
Check for additional rust spots.,
Dry the chrome completely.",How to Remove Rust from Chrome3," Chrome polish is the most expensive of the methods for removing rust, but a quality product will make removal quick and easy. A light penetrating oil such as WD40, CLR, or CRC can be used instead, and is typically the cheaper option.

, Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome it is best to make sure all the dirt and other debris are removed. This helps you to see and access the rust more easily for removal.


If the dirt is very difficult to remove you can also use vinegar to clean the surface of the chrome. Vinegar is a mild acid and will help in the process of rust removal as well.

, Spread the cleaning substance over the rusted area on the chrome and make sure it is coated completely to avoid scratching the surface.

, Soft brass wool or a brass wire brush is best for this purpose, since it is less likely to cause major scratches. If you cannot find brass wool, use the finest steel wool available, preferably grade #0000. Coating it with additional chrome polish will also help prevent scratching.

, Gently rub using a circular motion while making sure that the surface is moist at all times. Do not apply pressure while rubbing or else you will damage the surface.


If the area gets dry then be sure to add more oil or chrome polish. Rubbing dry chrome with metal wool will scratch and damage the surface.

, Rinse off the metal polish and removed rust by washing the area with water.

, If the surface of the chrome is not completely free of rust spots then use additional chrome polish to try to remove the spots using the same method.

, Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces so it is best to dry the chrome completely to make it shiny and brilliant.


Make sure to put a coat of polish or wax on the chrome to keep the rust from reforming.
If extra care is needed, check out the followup section below.

Buff and dry the surface.,
Protect the metal using polish or wax.,
Apply silver paint.,
Get the object re-chromed.",How to Remove Rust from Chrome4," If the rust only showed through the chrome in pinpricks, drying the surface with a towel after cleaning may be enough to keep up the chrome's appearance.

, Apply a wax or polish to the chrome to protect it from any further damage. Use a product only for its intended purpose, such as car wax for chrome-plated vehicles.


Typically, wax is applied, buffed and left to dry, then a second layer is applied over it and buffed again.

, This will keep a nice shine on the chrome, but the level of rust protection depends on the brand of paint and how well it is applied. Select a paint appropriate to the task, typically automotive paint, and apply as evenly as possible over areas pitted by rust damage. Use a fine, 1200 grit sandpaper to smooth it down after it dries, taking care to avoid sanding unpainted areas.

, This is an expensive option, usually only performed on cars that were severely damaged by rust. Hire a mechanic who offers a chrome plating service if you want to re-chrome your car. If you're feeling ambitious, you can try to chrome plate objects at home, especially if they are relatively small.

Take basic safety precautions.,
Mask any spots that you don't want to get dusty.,
Try to mask along the existing panel lines.,
Remove the paint around the rust with a dual action (DA) sander.,
Switch to a metal grinding wheel.,
Prepare the spot for priming.,
Apply thin, even coats of primer.,
Sand with 400 grit wet sandpaper.,
Spray a thin coat of paint.,
Buff the edges of the new paint so that it blends with the old paint.,
Wash and polish the car.",How to Remove Rust from a Car1," This method involves using a sander and a grinder — two powerful electric tools that can kick fine rust and paint dust into the air. To avoid injury and protect yourself from these airborne particles, be sure to wear gloves, safety glasses and especially a dust mask to keep the rust and paint particles out of your lungs.


For heavy-duty jobs, consider using a respirator rather than a simple dust mask.;
, As noted above, this job puts rust and paint particles in the air. If you're not careful, these can settle on your car, giving it a ""dirty"" appearance that can be hard to get off. To avoid this, ""mask"" the parts of your car that you're not working on (that is, cover them with tape and masking paper.) Use a tarp sealed with painter's tape under the car to define your work area and protect the floor.


Masking the car off is a delicate art. Do not use newspaper, as paint spray can leak through it and leave unsightly specks. Instead, use real masking paper, which is less porous and won't let paint through. Also, be sure to tape every single edge of your masking paper down. Don't just use a few small pieces of tape to get it to stay in place — paint can (and will) work its way under any loose edges.

, In general, you don't want your masking to stop in the middle of a panel, or you will be left with sharp lines where your new paint ends and the old paint begins. These lines do not go away with any amount of buffing or addition of clear coat layers, so practice prevention by masking the car correctly in the first place, stopping at the panel lines around your rust spots and going no farther inward.


If you're experienced with auto painting, you might alternatively try stopping your masking a few panels back from your rust spot. If you know how to gradually blend paint, which is done when spraying, you can use this tactic to make it so that there isn't a drastic color difference between one panel and the next.

, A DA sander gives you control over the speed of the sander while removing the paint. Start with 80 grit and work your way up to 150 grit. Use the DA sander with (80-150 grit) to take off both the primer and paint, as well as any light rust that hasn't fused with the metal, and level the surface between the painted surface and the unpainted area.


After you're done, feel with your (gloved) fingers — you should now have a smooth surface.

, Next, use a metal grinder to remove any thick rust buildups and expose any pits. When using the wheel, go slowly, because these tools can do a lot of damage to the car's body if used incorrectly. Once the grinding is done, apply rust removing acid to the area to remove the microscopic particles of rust that remain.


For this job, phosphoric acid is usually best and can be bought at most auto parts stores.
If you want, use a hole spot filler or a body filler like Bondo to even out some of the dents and fill the space where the paint is gone. Finish application of your filler by sanding by hand (using 120 grit sandpaper) to get a nice smooth metal surface. See below for more extensive information on using fillers.

, Purchase primer that is ideal for painting on bare metal and an auto spray that matches the color of your car. Both of these supplies can be found at an auto supply store. Primers may vary, so follow the instructions provided with your primer or talk to an expert at the auto store for definitive information. Typically, what you will need to do to prepare is:


Wipe the area with mineral spirits or paint thinner.
Tape newspaper on all surrounding areas within three feet.

, Spray three coats of primer, waiting a few minutes between coats to allow each one to apply. Don't over-apply — there shouldn't be so much primer in any one coat that it drips or runs.


For most primers, you'll need to allow the fresh coat to dry overnight (at least 12 hours).

, This abrasive is specifically made for sanding between paint coats to smooth the surface and degloss so the paint bonds properly. Keep a bucket of water handy to rinse the sandpaper frequently so that it does not get fouled with paint. To finish, wash the painted area with a light soap and water mix.

, Use thin coats of paint and let each coat ""rest"" for a minute or two between applications so as not to let the paint run or sag. Use as many coats of paint over the primer as you need in order to achieve a nice color and finish.


Let the paint set at least 24 hours before pulling off the tape. Be patient — if the paint still feels tacky, you may need more time.

, If necessary, apply a clear coat to match of the finish on the rest of the car. Finally, allow the paint to cure for 48 hours.

, Congratulations! Your car is now rust-free and ready to ride.


As a precaution, never wax fresh paint within 30 days of painting — the scrubbing, buffing action can pull fresh paint off.

Grind rust down to ""fresh steel."",
Cover the hole with a non-rusting filler.,
Use sandpaper to level.,
Mask around your work area.,
Apply primer, then paint.",How to Remove Rust from a Car2," This method is slightly different than the one above, but works by the same basic principles and should work especially well for rust spots that have caused holes or pitting. To start, use a metal grinder to remove all of the rust. You want to grind to the point where you have ""fresh"" (un-rusted) steel all around where the rust spot was, even if this leaves you with a hole.


Getting rid of all of the rust is crucial — if you miss even a small fleck of rust, it can corrode underneath your car's paint over time and lead to another rust spot.
Keep in mind, that, because you're using a grinder, all of the safety precautions at the beginning of the page apply for this method as well. That means wearing gloves, safety glasses and especially a dust mask to keep the rust and paint particles out of your lungs.

, Next, you'll want to apply a filler over your former rust spot. You can buy commercial fillers (like Bondo) at most auto stores for fairly cheap. For larger holes, however, you may need to improvise. In this case, you need something flat and fairly durable that paint can bind to and that won't rust to patch the hole with. Fix this object in place with a coat of commercial filler and allow it to dry.


Believe it or not, cut-up beer or soda cans work well for hole-patching purposes. The aluminum in these cans is naturally corrosion-resistant and many modern cans are coated with a thin protective layer anyway. Another good choice is thin sheets of hard plastic.

, Next, use sandpaper to create a smooth, even surface between your new ""patch"" and the actual body of the car. This can be a long, tedious process — as you sand, you'll probably find that you need to add additional filler and let it dry periodically as you sand away the existing filler. The process thus becomes something along these lines: Filler, grind, filler, grind, filler, grind... (and so on).


Start grinding with a rough (low grit) sandpaper to smooth out big bumps, then gradually transition to a medium and finally a fine (high grit) sandpaper for a perfectly smooth finish.
Slow, steady, hand-sanding is best for this process — mechanical grinders can tear your patch away.

, Next, you need to apply a fresh coating to your newly-repaired rust spot. To prepare for this, you'll need to mask most of your car to protect it from primer paint, and other airborne particles. Don't forget your windows and tires.


Try to have the edges of your masking aligned with existing seams in the body of the car to hide minor differences between your new paint and the old paint (unless you're experienced enough to produce a smooth blend).

, Apply a few thin coats of primer, allowing each coat a minute or two to adhere before you reapply on top of it. Let the primer dry overnight, then, after about 12 hours, give it a sanding with wet 400 grit sandpaper so that the paint can adhere properly. When you're ready, apply your paint on top, using a similar ""spray one thin coat at a time and let it dry"" strategy as you used for the primer.


You may want to buff out the edges of your paint and/or cover with a clear coat layer so that this section matches the finish on the rest of your car.
Obviously, it's important to pick a paint that matches your car's current finish. There is a specific paint color code for each vehicle that can be found on a sticker somewhere in the vehicle. This information is needed in order to match the color up. Most auto paint shops will be more than happy to help you with this. Keep in mind, however, that the paint on older cars can gradually discolor over time.

Stay calm.,
Tune to the emergency channel.,
Take a few deep breaths and rehearse what you are going to say.,
Make the call.,
Wait for a response.,
Follow instructions unless you need to evacuate immediately.,
Stand by.",How to Call Mayday from a Marine Vessel1," In the event of an emergency, such as from a sinking vessel, a disabled vessel, an on-board fire, sudden mass illness or pirate or hijacking activity, it's important to remain as calm as possible so that you can act with a level head. If there is help close by, the help will be able to help you. You won't be able to guess at the proximity of help, so it's best to stop worrying and start acting, while waiting for assistance to reach you.
Evaluate the situation. Understand that you are to make a Mayday call only if you are in a serious distress situation where there is an immediate or imminent threat to life or loss of property. This includes fire, injury, the vessel taking on water, or people fallen overboard, etc.

If your vessel is sinking, if you're in a life-threatening situation such as a fire or explosion, if pirates are seeking to board your boat, or if everyone on the boat suddenly succumbs to a strange illness that prevents crewing of the vessel, the Mayday call is appropriate.
If your mast or other rigging breaks, or if one person falls ill but it's not life-threatening, send a Pan-Pan call instead.

, Tune your radio to marine VHF radio channel one-six (16) or Frequency 161.400 or 156.800 MHz; marine MF/SSB on 2182 kHz. These channels are constantly monitored by Coast Guard and other sea rescue authorities (as well as nearby boaters) so are more likely to be responded to. When on a boat, the radio should be on, and tuned to channel 16, even if there is no emergency. (Most newer radios have the option of multiple channel monitoring. Ensure 16 is one of them) If you cannot communicate on 16, use any channel with traffic on it; once you do so, protocol will expect all traffic on that channel to cease unless it relates to the Mayday call, so as to assist you.Push the red ""DSC"" button, if there is one. Newer radios have a button labeled ""DSC"" (Digital Select Calling), which transmits the GPS coordinates to the coastguard along with a Mayday beacon. Older radios do not have this, also, if the radio is not connected to a GPS unit, it will have no coordinates to transmit (although the Mayday beacon will still go through). Remember though, that even if the radio has a DSC button, don't let the digital mayday transmission do all the work. You have some needed information that the transmitter doesn't, such as the urgency of the situation, and a description of what is happening.

Listen to the channel. Ensure there are no other emergency transmissions, or other chatter that will cut you off. Although it is absolutely OK to cut off non-emergency chatter when you are in a Distress Situation, they may come back and cut you off afterward. If you don't have time to consider this, just get on with sending out your distress signal.

, Remain calm. Keep in mind:


Mayday is always stated three times in a row, to ensure that it is heard accurately, and to distinguish it from radio talk about receipt of a Mayday call.
It is essential to speak clearly, slowly, and split numbers. For example, say One-Five instead of Fifteen.
If you know the phonetic alphabet - Use it! (i.e. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie etc.)
Hold the microphone a few inches away from your mouth.
Stay calm, rushing through the transmission is not going to help you get help any faster.

, Press and hold the talk button (usually labeled ""PTT"" (""Push To Talk"")) and say something along the lines of:


Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is on the . Callsign . (If you’re using a VHF-DSC radio, provide your Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI)). BREAK.
Release the microphone button momentarily to ensure the channel is clear. Press again.
Mayday. The vessel is located . (For example, Position 54 25 North 016 33 West, drifting at one knot with a bearing of 228 degrees). We are a experiencing and are in need of immediate assistance.

There are with . Length, color, rig of boat can be helpful, as well as any intention to deploy life boats, etc.
This is , . Over.
If you don't have all of this information, it's okay. Give the information that you DO have.

, Let go of the Talk button (unkey). Wait for a response. If you do not hear one after 15 seconds, repeat the call again.


While waiting, prepare flares, life rafts, life jackets, gather emergency supplies, call orders to others to prepare, etc. Stay calm and set an example for everyone else to follow.
If you still have no reply and don't have to leave your boat yet, listen on another channel and break in with your distress call. It may be that your transmitter is too weak or not responding well, so ask other vessels to transmit your distress call to shore.

, You may be asked to switch to a Coast Guard 'working channel'. You may be told, for example, to switch to another channel. If so, confirm by saying something like, ""Confirmed, Switching to .""


In the event that you need to leave immediately after making a Mayday call, inform authorities of what you're doing as part of the additional information in the Mayday message, for example, ""We are taking to lifeboat/deploying a life raft"".
If you're able to maintain radio contact, follow all the radio operator's instructions. They are trained professionals and it is their job to help you

Connect the boom vang to the middle position.,
Move everyone under the mainsail and boom.,
Release the jibe sheet.,
Tighten the main sheet.,
Start to turn the boat downwind.,
Secure the jibe sheet to the new side of the boat.,
Ease the mainsail onto the other side of the boat.,
Finish turning the boat and stabilize on your new course.,
Reattach the boom vang to the other side of the boat.",How to Jibe1," A boom vang is a rope and pulley system that holds the boom against the side of your boat so that it doesn't jibe or tack on its own. Before you jibe, move the boom vang from the side rail to middle position, near the mast of the boat. This secures the main sail to the center of the boat so that you can jibe., Once people know that you're jibing the boat, they should duck their heads under the boom and mainsail and move to the other side of the boat. This prevents them from getting hit by the boom as it comes across the boat., You have to release the rope on the jibe sheet for the jibe sail to fully transition to the other side of the boat. Unwind the rope that's attached to the jibe sheet so that the jibe sail is free to move side to side., The mainsheet is the rigging that attaches to the mainsail and is what is used to control the position of your sail. Wrap the rope of the mainsheet around the cleat that can be found inside of the boat and use the wench or push it manually with your hands to bring it in, towards the center of the boat.Doing this before you turn the boat wheel will prevent the mainsail and boom from swinging across the boat.

, As you turn the boat downwind, the jibe sail should start to automatically transition to the other side of your boat as it catches the wind, so you won't have to manually move the jib sail. You'll also get resistance on the mainsail lead as the wind starts to push the sail to the other side of the boat., Once the jibe sail on the opposite side of the boat, wrap the other rope on the jibe sheet to the cleat on the side of the boat.This should secure the jibe sail onto the boat's new heading., The jibe sail should already be on the other side of the boat. Hold the mainsheet to prevent it from quickly flipping to the other side and destabilizing the boat. Slowly start to release the rope until the mainsail settles on the other side of the boat., Once the sails have caught the wind, stop turning the boat. Bring the wheel or tiller back to the center position so that your boat continues down the new heading. Continue going down this heading until you need to tack or jib the boat again., Reattaching the boom vang to the other side of the boat ensures that the boat won't automatically tack or jibe if the wind changes courses. Unclip the boom vang from the center of your boat and reclip it to the side of the boat where the mainsail is now flying."
"
Say ""Ready to jibe"" to your crew.,
Have the crew respond by saying ""Ready."",
Say ""Jibing"" or ""Jibe-ho"" to instruct your crew to start the jibe.",How to Jibe2," Alert your crew that you want to jibe. Letting them know will allow them to do their part in preparing and moving the sails. It will also signal them to steer clear of the mainsail and the boom, which will be coming across the boat.Alternatively, you can say ""Prepare to jibe.""

, The crew member assigned to moving the sails, or the sail trimmer, should get into position and prepare the mainsail for the jibe before responding with ""Ready."" Once they are in position, they should respond with this verbal command to let the captain of the boat know that they are ready to move the sail. Typically, you'll have more than one crew member on the ship, but you only really need two people to jibe the boat., Jibe-ho will let the rest of the crew know that you are starting to jibe the boat. At this point, the crew can start the mainsail to the other side of the boat and you can begin to turn your boat downwind."

Stay hydrated.,
Eat bland complex carbohydrates.,
Take ginger.,
Try other herbal remedies.,
Consider an acupressure bracelet.,
Use the bathroom before you launch.,
Pack airsickness bags.,
Stay sober and well-rested.",How to Prevent Seasickness1," Drink plenty of water and some fruit juices or sports drinks. Limit consumption of caffeine and alcohol, as these may worsen dehydration.Dehydration can exacerbate symptoms of seasickness., Most people settle their stomach best by eating a moderate meal low in fat and high in complex carbs, such as fruit and grains.Pack some especially bland food such as dry toast or crackers to eat in frequent, small snacks during the trip.If you've been motion sick before, you probably know which foods are comforting and which you need to avoid. Trust your gut!

, Perhaps one of the most common folk remedies for nausea, ginger is also backed up by medical studies.You can take it in any form, but a chewable tablet or a hard candy has the extra bonus of stimulating saliva production, which can also help settle your stomach. Start taking the ginger at least a couple hours before boarding, and up to two days before a long trip.Many ginger ales, candies, and cookies contain very little actual ginger. Check the label and try to find something that provides at least 500 mg (half a gram) every few hours.
Do not give ginger to children under the age of two, and avoid taking more than four grams a day. Always consult your doctor before taking ginger, especially if you already take other medications., Peppermint, fennel, and lavender are just a few of the plants people use to alleviate seasickness. Although the medical effects are less well studied than ginger's, any pleasant scent or taste can help by distracting you. Try sipping tea or sucking a hard candy made from one of these plants., There is no good evidence that these have any real effect, but they are widely available and will not cause any harm.You can also mimic the effect simply by pressing on your inner wrists.

, Onboard facilities are typically cramped and evil-smelling, the worst place to be when you're seasick. If you're only on the boat for a few hours, use them before you leave so you can avoid them once the motion sickness hits.

, If your motion sickness gets really bad, you'll usually feel better after vomiting. Pack sick bags (or reserve a bucket on board) so you have an easy way to heed the call. Running to a smelly bathroom makes things worse, and leaning over the rail may not be safe in rough weather.


Don't clutch the bag in front of you the whole time. Do your best to distract yourself during the trip, and keep the bag accessible but out of sight.

, Going on board drunk, hungover, or exhausted can make the problem much worse.Alcohol is especially risky if you plan to take anti-nausea medication, since it can increase the sedative effect or cause dangerous drug interactions.

"
"
Watch the distant horizon or close your eyes.,
Get some fresh air.,
Stay distracted.,
Lie down.",How to Prevent Seasickness2," Motion sickness is most likely caused by the conflict of signals between your eyes and the balancing sensors in your inner ear.Watching the horizon in front of the boat gives you a steadier view. If that is not an option, close your eyes.


If the movement at the bow is too much for you, move back to the center of the boat.

, Stay above deck whenever possible, away from stuffy enclosed spaces and unpleasant smells. It's best to choose the lee of the boat (the side away from wind) in case you need to vomit.

, Start an activity before you start feeling sick, and continue it as long as you can. Help steer the boat if possible, as this helps you anticipate motion and requires you to focus on the horizon. If you are a passenger on a larger craft, distract yourself by counting birds and ships.Do not read or look at a screen. Focusing your eyes on a nearby point is terrible for seasickness.
Avoid others who are experiencing motion sickness, as the sight or smell of others being sick may bring on or worsen your own sea sickness., If nothing else works, lie down with your body parallel to the side of the boat, with your head pointed towards the bow. This reduces the sensation of motion and increases blood flow to the head, which can counteract the light-headed, dizzy feel some people experience.Keep your eyes closed unless there's a convenient view of the horizon.


A hammock helps reduce the sensation of side-to-side movement.
If you are in a bunk, wedge thick life jackets or other objects under the mattress to create a V-shape between the mattress and the wall. Lie in the narrow V so you are pinned against the wall, restricting your motion."
"
Choose a medication.,
Look for non-oral drugs.,
Take the medication several hours before your departure.,
Check for unpleasant side effects.,
Be aware of medical risks.,
Clear your sinuses.",How to Prevent Seasickness3," There are many over-the-counter medications for preventing motion sickness. Here are the most common options:Antihistamines such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or cinnarizine (Stugeron; not available in the U.S. or Canada)are the most popular choice. Non-drowsy versions may be less effective.
Scopolamine (also called hyoscine)may also be effective.
If neither option above works for you, ask a doctor about other prescription treatments. Benzodiazepinesare rarely used, but may be appropriate for severe seasickness., If you suspect you might vomit, look for drugs that don't enter through your stomach. Scopolamine is available as a skin patch and as an intranasal spray, both of which may be more effective than the pill form.Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) is available in chewing gum form, which bypasses the stomach but is only used for immediate, fast-acting treatment, not prevention., The medicine will be more effective if it's already in your bloodstream when you step onto the boat. Plus, you avoid the problem of forcing yourself to swallow medicine while you feel sick. Take your first dose prior to departure as indicated by your doctor or on the packaging.


Schedule regular doses on a long boat trip, but do not exceed the recommended daily limit. Overdoses can cause serious medical problems.

, Many people experience drowsiness, dizziness, or blurred vision after taking these medications, especially in high doses or as a skin patch. If you plan to help steer or operate machinery on the boat, conduct a test run on land to make sure the drug will not interfere with your work.Some children react to antihistamines by getting agitated instead of drowsy, which you may want to test for before your trip.Seek emergency attention if you experience an allergic reaction (rash, swelling, tight chest, difficulty breathing), or any serious symptom.

, Ask for a doctor's advice if you are pregnant, nursing, have a serious medical condition, take any other medication, or have an allergy to any medication. Children 12 or under should follow age- and weight-based dosage instructions. Large doses of sedating antihistamines can be fatal to young children.Many medications can increase nausea, including birth control and antibiotics. Consider asking your doctor about alternatives to take during your boat trip.
Always talk to a doctor before medicating a child under 2 years old. Seasickness is unusual in infants and toddlers, so treatment is rarely necessary.

, If you have a stuffy nose or blocked ears, treat the problem before and during travel. Blocked sinuses can increase pressure on your inner ear, which can make dizziness and seasickness worse.


Do not take medication for your sinuses and for seasickness at the same time without consulting a doctor. They often contain similar drugs, which could lead to an unintentional overdose.

Understand the mechanics behind a sinking ship.,
The stability of a ship depends, in part, on its center of gravity.,
Always check for the location of personal flotation devices once you have boarded any sea vessel.,
Think about your sense of etiquette.",How to Escape a Sinking Ship1," While this is mainly for the sake of curiosity, understanding how a ship sinks can be useful and give you a sense of what occurs if you're ever stuck in the situation of being on a sinking ship. Every type of ship will react to taking on water and sinking differently depending on the shape of the hull, center of gravity, and cause of the casualty. No one set of rules works on all ship types.


Water often enters the lowest point of a ship first, the bilge area.The bilges are pits in the lowest part of the engineering section. It's very normal for ships to have water leaking into the bilges. It comes in through sea chests, shaft bearings, or valve seals. Ships have bilge pumps to remove this water once it reaches a certain level. They are in the bilges to attack any eventual flooding as early as possible at the lowest possible level. However, this is not always a viable solution. Ships can sink from hitting another ship, an object such as an iceberg, a ruptured sea chest, or an attack. In the case of the Greek cruise liner MTS Oceanos the water entered through a ruptured overboard sewage discharge valve far from the bilges and erupted into the ship through commodes, sinks, and showers. There was no way the pumps could have helped. The Titanic had seams popped and split starting about 50 feet (15.2 m) from the starboard bow and flooded 6 compartments. The rest is history. There was just too much water for the pumps to discharge. The Lusitania was torpedoed and exploded twice. Both the MS Sea Diamond and the MS Costa Concordia ran aground and sank after hitting well marked reefs while sailing in good weather. There are many other famous examples.
Small boats will react differently than bigger ships. They are normally built, as much as possible, of buoyant materials. Reasons for why a boat might sink include a low transom, missing drain plugs, cooling system leaks, or openings either incorrectly closed or broken doors (such as on a car ferry).The broken doors is what sank the car ferry Estonia.;
, In the case of the Estonia the car ferry took on water through a broken door. In that event, the rocking slowed down, which is a bad sign because a ferry that isn't rocking cannot stabilize itself.With Trans-Oceanic ships the configuration is different. According to researcher Steve Zalek of the University of Michigan Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Department, Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory, studies done demonstrate that if the center of gravity is low the ship will rock quickly. Passengers will become seasick, cargo can break loose, and containers can be pitched into the sea, but if the center of gravity is higher the ship will rock more slowly. Passengers will be more comfortable, cargo won't break loose, and containers aren't pitched overboard. Rocking too much could cause a ship to keel over in heavy seas. The ideal is that the ship would heel over to no more than 10° either way in order when the wheel is thrown hard over to maintain stability., Whether you're going on a short trip across the harbor, a day trip, or a cruise, knowing the location of the personal flotation device in advance may save your life.


When going on a cruise, part of the standard safety drill at the beginning will include asking you to check that your PFD is in the cabin space. Be sure to check for infant or child PFDs if also needed and alert crew immediately if these are not in place. In addition, look for the lifeboats nearest to your cabin, along with any obvious markers that might lead you to the boats if visibility becomes bad; as with aircraft, there will often be lights designating where safety exits are.
Read the instructions for putting on the personal flotation device and using it. If you have any questions, ask the ship's crew.
If you're traveling on a ship where the crew speaks a different language from your own, find people who can advise you directly on what to do in the event of an emergency. It is prudent to seek this information even before you board the ship.

, Although philosophical and theoretical in nature, the question is: What will you do if push came to shove? Would you expect to see women and children off first, then men? Or is it everyone for themselves? This actually depends upon the laws of what national waters the ship is in first, and the flag registry or nation of ownership second. Women and children boarded lifeboats from the Titanic because she was in international waters, and flagged in England, whose laws demanded such action- and they had time to board lifeboats. However, Lusitania sank in 18 minutes, giving no one time to board life boats.

Send out a Mayday if you're in charge of the sinking ship.,
Listen for the evacuation signal.,
Put on your personal flotation device (PFD).,
Follow directions.,
Stay calm and don't panic.,
Focus on escaping via the quickest route, not the shortest route.,
Once you've made it on deck, head to your emergency station or the nearest lifeboat available.,
Find a lifeboat.,
Stay calm in the lifeboat, follow directions, and wait for rescue.,
Expect some harsh realities.",How to Escape a Sinking Ship2," Read How to call Mayday from a marine vessel to learn how to do this.

, This is standard – 7 short horn blasts followed by one long one.The captain or other crew members may also use the intercom system to speak to all other crew and passengers.

, Be as prepared to exit the ship as time allows. If you have time to grab any additional survival items, do so. But only if doing so won't endanger your life or the lives of others.

If you have time, put on all your waterproof gear, such as headgear, jacket, and gloves.If there is an emergency survival suit available and time permits, put it on. Note that while survival suits increase your chances of surviving in cold water, they are unlikely to be provided on passenger ships. For crew who have access to such suits, they will usually be required to practice putting on this suit within 2 minutes.
Attend to all infants, children, and pets after you've prepared yourself.

, This may be the most important step of all. If you don't know how to get to safety, the captain or one of the crew members will tell you how. Ship's crews are highly trained in rescue operations on many ships and will have a better understanding than you about what needs to be done to ensure your safety. You should only attempt to escape on your own if there is no authority present to give proper directions. A well-run ship will have a ""muster station"" where everyone needs to gather in preparation for evacuation. If you received a safety drill in going to a muster station, try to comply with it.


If you can't hear or understand the directions (for example, it's not your language), keep one thing in mind - head up and off the ship. Heading to the center or inner levels of the boat is not wise but don't be surprised if people do this as a result of panic.
If the captain assigns you with tasks, speak up if you don't feel you can comply. Otherwise, do your best to help out.

, It may sound like an inevitable cliché, but the more you panic, the longer it will take to get to a lifeboat. Studies have shown that only about 15 percent of people manage not to panic, with a whopping 70 percent suffering from impaired reasoning and 15 percent becoming irrational.Thus, staying calm is important for dealing with other passengers as well as helping to keep your own mind focused to do whatever you can to survive. If others around you are panicking, try as best you can to calm them down, as their actions will only slow down and possibly endanger your evacuation. Unfortunately, panic on a cruise is something that can endanger everyone owing to the amount of people involved and this can lead people to push and shove one another, causing injuries before people have even left the ship.Be aware that the opposite spectrum of panic can kick in – that of being stunned and unable to respond at all.If you see someone frozen with fear, yell at them. This is what flight attendants are trained to do to get passengers to leave a burning plane, and can be adapted to a boat situation.
Try to focus on keeping your breathing under control. If you're used to breathing for yoga, pilates, or any similar relaxation breathing techniques, use these to calm you, as well as resorting to breathing this way if you end up in the water trying to survive., Getting out fast is more important that getting out by going the shortest way which might even lead you to more danger. As the ship begins to tilt, grab whatever you can to help you remain upright and able to reach your destination, such as handrails, pipes, hooks, light fittings, etc.


Do not take the elevator. Just as you should avoid elevators when escaping a fire, the same applies here; all electrically driven items are suspect. The last place you'll want to be on a sinking ship is stranded in an elevator, so only use it as a last resort if the stairs are flooded.
While still in the inner deck areas, watch for catapulting or floating objects coming your way. Large items hitting you can knock you unconscious or kill you.

, Most of today's cruise liners run safety drills and procedures prior to departing on voyages so that passengers know where to go in the event of an emergency. If not, head to where it seems that the crew are assisting passengers to escape. Crew will usually be the last to abandon ship, as it is their duty to get everyone else off the ship to possible safety first.


Don't play the hero by staying back while crew is on board. Do what needs to be done to ensure that survival of yourself and your loved ones is not compromised. This isn't the movies.

, The very best scenario is to enter a lifeboat without getting wet. The moment you're wet, you risk getting hypothermia or suffering from cold shock (see below). If lifeboats are already deployed, head for the best place to enter or jump into them, following instructions of crew if relevant.


If there are no lifeboats available, try to find a life preserver ring or similar flotation device and toss it into the water. Any flotation device is better than none, although your survival chances decrease dramatically once you're forced to spend time in the water.
You may need to jump off the ship, or in some cases, simply step off an incline. If there is a lifeboat nearby, swim to it, wave your arms, and shout to attract attention.
If jumping, always look first. There may be people, boats, fires, propellers, etc., in the water below that you could hit or be submerged in. The ideal scenario is getting straight into a lifeboat. If not, the next best scenario is to jump as close to a rescue boat as possible and make your way into it immediately.

, Waiting alone in the open ocean without the comfort of a large ship will undoubtedly be frightening, but be patient. Help is on the way.


In a lifeboat, use rations sparingly. Use flares only when it is clear that doing so will result in a rescuer seeing you. Huddle together to keep warm. Arrange lookout watches. Collect rainwater and don't drink seawater or urine. Treat any injuries as best you can.Stay determined. Stories of survivors at sea are a testament that it is the most determined who survive harsh waiting conditions leading up to rescue.
If you couldn't find a lifeboat, look for the next best things, such as a life raft, or bobbing objects from the ship (flotsam) that remain afloat.

, If you don't end up in a lifeboat either straight away or fairly quickly, your survival odds worsen a great deal. The sea is cold and if it's rough, even the strongest swimmers will have a hard time defeating the cold and the sea swells. Inadequate amounts of lifeboats or lost lifeboats mean that there can be more people than space, causing more panic and even endangering the remaining lifeboats as people desperately cling to them or clamber on.


Being in cold water will cause hypothermia. Hypothermia will cause you to want to sleep. If you fall asleep or fall unconscious, you risk drowning.
Cold shock is the kind of shock that comes from hitting cold water and being unable to control your breathing while your heart rate and blood pressure go up, immediately incapacitating you.Cold shock can cause you to take an involuntary breath, which will often cause you to take in water.While those who are used to entering cold water can tolerate this for initial few minutes required to regain your senses, many people are not able to do so and drown. This cold shock phenomenon occurs before hypothermia sets in.
Shock may set in, causing everything to become surreal and to prevent you from doing your best to survive. If shock doesn't set in, mental distress is a highly likely possibility, with nothing but water everywhere, right to the horizon, and not knowing when rescue will arrive. Try to prevent this by focusing on surviving, using mind games, counting, thinking about other people's needs, etc.
Your hands and fingers will become numb very quickly, making even doing up a lifejacket difficult, if not impossible.
Even in good weather, heatstroke, sunburn, and dehydration soon become an issue. Try to cover yourself up as best you can and ration water supplies carefully.
If you do survive, be ready for the reality that some of the people on the lifeboat with you may not. Seek counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder if needed.

Check the maximum rated load.,
Consider the country of manufacture.,
Read reviews.,
Decide whether you need low-clearance ramps.,
Check for a rubber stop.,
Look for signs of damage.,
Purchase wheel chocks as well.,
Slide the ramps against the front tires.,
Drive up the exact center of the ramp.,
Engage the parking brake.,
Put two wheel chocks around a back wheel.",How to Use Car Ramps," This is the most important characteristic of your ramp: the larger this number, the safer you'll be. The ramp's rating refers to the maximum Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) that can be driven onto the ramp.You can find the GVW on your driver's door sticker or owner's manual. The ramp's rating should be well above your car's GVW, to allow for a margin of error or a front-heavy car.


This rating usually assumes you are using two ramps. For example, a pair of ramps rated to 6,000 lbs can hold the front half of a 6,000 lb vehicle when using both ramps together.;
, Ramps made in the United States and the European Union are typically subject to stricter quality control than ramps from other countries. While there are safe and well-made ramps manufactured elsewhere, you should use caution and find out what others think of the product before you take the risk., Some car owners tell horror stories of a ramp collapsing under much less than the rated load. The risk is low but deadly, so it's worth searching online for the opinions of other users.

, These ramps have a more gradual incline so a sports car can drive up them without scraping the undercarriage. They tend to be expensive, so only buy them if you're sure a regular ramp won't do.

, The underside of many ramps include a rubber component make it less likely the ramps will slide when the car starts to drive up them. This is especially important if you work on your car on a smooth surface, since it will make it easier to drive up without the ramp sliding ahead of you., Throw away the ramp if you see any obvious signs of rust, cracks, or other damage.

, Using at least two wheel chocks is recommended whenever you have your car on ramps. It's hard to go wrong with chocks, but if you have a smooth or slippery garage floor, get soft rubber chocks., Position the lower slope of a ramp so it is perfectly centered with the tire. Sight along the side of the car to ensure the ramp is as straight as possible. Repeat with a second ramp on the other side.









If the wheels are turned, move them so they point straight ahead and try again.
Always work on a hard, level, paved or concrete surface.Avoid wet or slippery surfaces, which can make it difficult to drive up the ramp without sliding.

, Get in the car and drive forward directly up the ramp. Get out and confirm that the front wheels are centered exactly on the ramps, and fully on the flat portion of the ramp. If they aren't, drive back off and try again.









Most ramps have a small bump at the end to tell you when you've reached the edge. If this doesn't look adequate on your ramp, have a friend spot you to prevent you from driving over it.
If the ramps slide forward as you drive, you'll need to drive a little faster — but keep it smooth and cautious. If you cannot safely drive up the ramp this way, hold the ramps in place by positioning a board between the wall and the back of the ramp., Once you are sure the car is centered, use the emergency brake to ensure the car does not roll back down the ramp. Stand to the side and gently rock the car to make sure it is stable.







, Place one wheel chock in front of the back wheel, and the other one behind.This is an additional safety measure to keep the car from rolling in either direction. Now you can safely access the underside of the car.









If you want to be extra safe, put your car on jack stands as well.

, This may require that the hood be opened.


Place a rubber mat, cardboard or some other piece of material in the area around the base of the wiper arm and position it to protect the glass and paint finish in case a tool slips.

, Verify that the arm position is still correct and use a small flat screwdriver to pry the plastic cap covering the nut at the base of the arm away from the recessed nut well. The plastic cap may have a small slot to assist in inserting the screwdriver. With this dust cap removed, you will have the access you need to remove the nut.

, Now that the dust cap is removed and you can analyze the hex nut that holds the wiper arm onto the drive post you should choose a socket that fits it. Place the socket on the ratchet or, if needed, on an extension that is attached to the ratchet.


Be certain that the socket is an exact fit as some are metric and some are SAE. There should be no extra room or wiggle when you place the socket over the nut.

, Ratchets are designed both tighten and loosen nuts and bolts. You want to be sure you are set to spin in a clockwise direction. This will tighten the nut.

, Place the socket (and short extension if needed) onto the ratchet handle slide it over the nut. Gently attempt to tighten the nut. If it turns easily, continue to tighten until it gets snug and then go about 1/8 of a turn more to secure the nut. If the nut is already very tight, stop this process.


If the nut just spins in place and does not tighten, either the nut or the drive post may be stripped. If the nut is stripped it will need to be replaced. If the drive post is stripped it will need to be replaced, and this may mean replacing the windshield wiper motor.
If the nut was already very tight, you will need to loosen the retaining nut and remove the wiper arm for inspection. If the base of the wiper arm is stripped or damaged this can cause the same behavior as a loose nut, but cannot be repaired. It will be necessary to purchase a new wiper arm and install it., Turn the ignition key on, turn the wipers on and test the travel of the arm for proper operation. If the arm slips, you will need to replace it.

, If your wiper problem was not the result a loose nut, your wiper arm might be stripped out. In this case you need to replace it. The new arm needs to rest exactly where the original rested to insure proper travel. Bar soap, wax, or another easy to remove mark will work fine to mark this spot.

,


Place the socket and ratchet fully over the hex nut and hold in place with one hand while Stabilizing the wiper arm by firmly gripping it with the other hand. This will prevent the linkage from exceeding the designed range of motion when twisting the ratchet.
Twist the ratchet to spin the nut counter clockwise one half to one full turn.
Once the hex nut is loosened, release your grip of the wiper arm and remove the socket and ratchet from the hex nut. Spin the hex nut completely off by hand and set aside for reuse.

, Lift the wiper blade up from the windshield with one hand and hold the point of attachment with the other. Gently ""rock"" the wiper blade back and forth while lifting with both hands and remove from the drive post.

, This will remove trapped metal and dirt from the shaft splines. Be sure to wipe the shaft completely dry after cleaning.

, Ensure that it has matching splines that will mate with the shaft.

, Line up the splines so that they mate with the shaft.Make sure that your wiper arm is in the correct resting position on the windshield (it should land on the same mark you made with the original wiper).

, It is ideal to use a tool that will not scratch your new wiper arm. Rubber mallets work well for this.

, This will help prevent the nut from cross-threading, stripping or being damaged when you tighten it.

, Ensure that the nut turns freely and is not cross-threaded. If it turns easily, continue to tighten until it gets snug and then us the ratchet to go about 1/8 of a turn more to secure the nut.

Check the washer fluid reservoir for dirt.,
Look for cracks, leaks, or breaks in the plastic or rubber hoses connected to the washer reservoir.,
Add more washer fluid if necessary.,
Unclog dirt from nozzles, hoses or screens.,
Have someone else turn on your car's ignition.,
Try an alternative cleaning method.,
Check the aim of your washer nozzles.,
Check your washer pump's power if the fluid is still not appearing when activated.",How to Troubleshoot a Windshield Washer Pump," If dirt has sunk to the bottom of the reservoir, remove the reservoir from the car and clean it well inside. Reconnect the necessary wires and hoses when reinstalling the reservoir.;
, Replace any faulty hoses.

,


Mix a washer fluid solution according to the fluid product. Fill the pump's reservoir to the necessary level with the solution. Use a funnel to help you.
Use a formulated, non-freezing washer fluid in the wintertime.

, Use a long pin or fine wire to pick out or poke through clogged dirt. Follow by rinsing the parts that are exposed with water.

, Ask them to activate the washer system to send out fluid. Let the washer fluid solution flush the system of remaining dirt or deposits.


Detach hoses one at a time to make sure that washer fluid is exiting through them. If hoses are clean or new but fluid is not reaching them, the cause could be an electrical problem.

, Rather than having to remove the washer fluid reservoir from the car to clean out dirt, etc., try filling it with water. Then siphon it out. Do this several times until the water comes out clean. It works a treat and will save you the job of trying to extract a rather difficult-to-access reservoir.

, They should squirt fluid above the windshield's center. Adjust them if necessary.


Washer nozzles may be found on the windshield wiper arms. The nozzles could also be on the car's hood panel and aimed separately at the windshield. Other nozzle configurations are having one nozzle for the left and right sides of the car or having adjustable offset nozzles arranged on a base.
Washer nozzles on wiper arms should not need adjusting because they are already centered and move with the arms.
Individual nozzles may be adjusted by moving a tab connected to each nozzle by hand. If no tabs are present, gently adjust the nozzles with pliers.
Adjust fixed nozzles by loosening a retaining nut for the entire nozzle body. Find the nut under the car's hood. Turn the nozzle so it sprays as much of the windshield as possible. Hold the nozzle in place and tighten the nut.
Nozzles that can be adjusted in their body can be aimed properly with a screwdriver, wrench, or pliers. If the tools cannot grab onto the nozzle, insert a thin needle or wire into the nozzle's opening. Move the nozzle in the direction you want, but do not force it or your wire or needle could break and get lodged in the nozzle.

,


Turn off the car's power.
Look for the pump on or in your washer fluid reservoir. It may also be attached to your windshield wiper's motor.
Unplug the washer pump's electrical connector.
Turn the ignition back on. Have someone else activate the washer and keep it on.
Use a test light to see if the pump is receiving power. You can also listen for a humming sound and feel for a vibration from the pump to see if it is powered.
If it is not getting power, check for a blown fuse. Access your car's fuse box, find the fuse for your washer pump, and replace it if necessary.
You may need to take your car to a professional mechanic or auto shop to fix wiring or electrical problems, especially if the washer is activated by a button on the car's steering-column.
If the pump does receive power but still does not send out fluid, it may need replacing. Take the pump out from its location and replace it with a new one. You will also want to replace the seal that the pump goes through into the tank.

Raise the windshield wipers.,
Remove the wiper blade from the wiper arm.,
Install the new wiper blade.,
Test your wiper blades.",How to Remove Windshield Wipers1," This is the first step to changing your windshield wiper blades. When lifted, the wiper arm should rest unassisted above the windshield without touching the glass.






;
, To do this, you will have to release the connector. There are three common connector designs, and they each release a little differently.









Hook-slot connectors are shaped like a ""j"" at the end of the blade. This j-hook has a tab that needs to be lifted or pushed to release the blade. Once released, push or pull the blade down toward the base of the wiper arm to remove it from the hook slot.
Pin-type connectors are fitted with a protruding pin that points down from the end of the blade. This pin pushes into the side the wiper arm and has a tab that fastens it in place. The tab will need to be lifted from the top with a flat head screwdriver or pushed up from underneath the wiper arm. Once the tab is released, the blade can be removed by pulling it sideways off of the arm.
Straight-end connectors have grooved ends that slide onto the windshield wiper arm. They also may have a tab on top of the existing blade that must be lifted with a screwdriver to release the blade from the arm. Once released you may have to adjust the angle of the blade to pull it away from the arm.

, This will also depend on the type of fastener used on your car.









For hook-slot connectors, slide the new wiper blade into the hook slot at the end of the wiper arm.
For pin-type connectors you should slide the arm on from the same side that you removed the original wiper blade. Once it is in place, lock down the tab to hold the blade.
For straight-end connectors you may have to change the angle of the blade to make it slide onto the wiper arm. If your design has a clip or tab, make sure that it is locked down as well.

, You don't want a wiper to fly off on the open road. To make sure this doesn't happen, spray water or windshield wiper cleaner onto your windshield and turn on the wipers. If they are wiping properly you are finished. If they appear to be loose or wiggling on the arm then you should make sure they are properly fastened before driving again.

Measure your car.,
Gather materials.,
Assemble the legs.,
Add your platform.,
Cover the platform.,
Assemble the platform.,
Outfit your bed.",How to Make a Bed in Your Car3," To determine how large you can make your platform, you will need to measure the area that you intend to put it. Decide if you want your back seats up or down to fit the platform, and measure the length and width of your configuration.Remember that vertical height will be important, too. Generally speaking, you should plan on your platform being eight to ten inches above the base on which it sits.

, The base of your platform should be sheets of ¾ inch (2 cm) or one inch plywood, while the legs will be constructed from two by fours. You will also need wood screws, a drill, a covering such as carpet, and staples. All of these materials can be found at a hardware or home improvement store.Have the plywood sheet cut to fit the dimensions you measured. Cut the large sheet in half widthwise so that your platform can be stored in stackable sections.
Have the two by fours cut up so that you end up with 12 pieces. Eight of them should be the height of your intended platform (8 to 10 inches or 20 to 26 cm), while four of them should be about four inches shorter than the width of your plywood sheet.

, You will need four legs, two for each platform. Make the legs by aligning a short section of two by four to either end of a long two by four piece. Make sure the legs are level with the support, then use 4 or 5 inch (10 to 13 cm) wood screws to secure the legs directly to the support.Opt to use at least two screws for each individual foot.
Repeat this process until you have four sets of legs completed.

, Once your legs are completed, make your platform by screwing the plywood sheets onto the legs. Each sheet should have two legs, one toward the top and one toward the bottom.Consider the positioning of the legs before you install them. They may need to get around wheels, indents, or other features in your car’s interior.
Screw the platform down with at least one screw over each foot, as well as one in the middle of each support.

, Use carpet, fabric, a tarp, or whatever covering you think is appropriate to cover your platform. Staple your cover down along the edges of your platform using carpet tacks or industrial staples.Try to staple the cover to the outer edges of the platform for maximum comfort.

, The platform can be stored in two separate pieces whenever you are not using it. To assemble it, simply unstack the two pieces and set them up so that one sits directly in front of the other in the back of your car.


To help the platform hold together a bit, consider adding a velcro edge where the two pieces of platform attach.

, Once you have your two platforms ready and in position, decide how you want to outfit your bed. You may want to use sleeping pads, an air mattress, blankets, or another form of cushioning to keep you off the hard surface. Prepare yourself with any pillows, sheets, and blankets you might want, as well.The sleeping platform can be outfit however you want. Choose a setup that is comfortable for you when your sleeping, and easy to store when you have the platform packed away.

Your vehicle will no longer be able to contact OnStar for help during an accident or other emergency situation.
The system is not completely disabled at this point, however. OnStar can continue to collect data from your vehicle for its own purposes.If you want to deactivate the OnStar system's ability to collect data, you will need to remove the system fuse or disconnect the system completely.

Keep the vehicle off.,
Locate the fuse compartment.,
Open the fuse compartment.,
Locate the OnStar fuse.,
Pull out the fuse.,
Keep the fuse in a safe spot.,
Check the vehicle.",How to Deactivate Onstar2," Make sure that the vehicle's ignition is turned off before accessing the fuse compartment.


Removing a fuse while the vehicle is running can be very dangerous. It can also cause damage to the overall fuse box and the other fuses.
Note that you should also apply the parking brake if you have not done so already.

, In most vehicles, the fuse compartment is located on the left side of the vehicle, beneath the dashboard and in between the steering wheel and the car door.


Alternatively, the fuse compartment might be located in the interior doorjamb or on the right passenger side of the vehicle near the floor.
Many vehicles have one fuse box underneath the hood of the car and a second fuse compartment inside the passenger portion of the vehicle. The OnStar fuse should be located in the second fuse compartment, not the fuse box under the hood.

, The fuse compartment should have a handle on it. Simply pull the handle and lift away the door to expose the fuses.


In rare instances, there might be a screw you will need to remove before pulling off the fuse compartment cover.

, There should be a diagram of fuses located on the back of the fuse panel cover. Use that diagram to determine where the OnStar fuse is located.In many vehicles, the OnStar fuse is a red fuse located in the upper left corner of the fuse box.
If there is no diagram on the back of the fuse panel cover, you should check the operator's manual for your vehicle and locate the appropriate diagram there.
Vehicles that come off the lot with OnStar automatically installed will probably have a fuse specifically marked for the OnStar system. If there is not ""OnStar"" fuse, however, you may need to locate the fuse for the mirror.
Note that removing an OnStar fuse connected to other systems, like the mirror or radio, will also deactivate any associated functions. For that reason, this method may only be appropriate when there is a separate OnStar fuse unconnected to other systems.

, To remove the fuse and deactivate the system, simply pinch the fuse between your fingers and pull it straight out.


If you are unable to pull the fuse out with your fingers, use a plastic plug puller or plastic-tipped tweezers.
Do not remove the fuse unless you are certain that you have located the correct one.

, It's a good idea to store the fuse in the glove box or another secure location in case you want to reactivate OnStar later.


To reactivate OnStar, simply return the fuse to its place within the fuse box.
If the free trial is still active when you remove the fuse, OnStar will be unable to remotely turn off the trial after it expires. You may need to temporarily plug the fuse back into the vehicle long enough for OnStar to turn off the trial.

, Return the cover to the fuse compartment and turn on the ignition. Test all systems in the vehicle to make sure that no others were affected.


If the OnStar light was on prior to the removal of the fuse, it should now be off.
Other than the OnStar system and its related services, no other system in the vehicle should stop working. If other systems have also stopped working, they may have been connected to the OnStar fuse. There will be no way to return these systems to functioning order without plugging the fuse back into the fuse box.
The process is complete once you finish verifying that everything else in your vehicle still works.

Open the trunk.,
Remove the liner.,
Lift out the spare tire.,
Remove the sill plate.,
Pull away the right side panel.,
Identify the OnStar box.,
Unplug all three connectors.,
Coil up the cables.,
Return the trunk to its original state.,
Check the system.",How to Deactivate Onstar3," You'll need to access the OnStar radio control box directly. In most vehicles, it is mounted to the back of the right rear wheel well, which can be accessed through the trunk.


In some vehicles, the OnStar control box will be located behind the left wheel well. It should still be accessible through the trunk if this is the case.

, Locate the edge of the trunk carpet or liner. Simply grab the liner around one edge and lift it out.


The liner itself shouldn't be secured with any screws or nuts.
After removing the liner, set it aside and look at the newly revealed space. If your vehicle has space for the spare tire, you should see that space and/or the spare tire after removing the liner.

, If your vehicle has a spare tire in it, you will need to remove it from the trunk and set it aside for now.In some cases, there might be a nut in the center of the spare tire compartment holding the tire in place. Use a screwdriver and twist the nut counterclockwise to remove it. After removing the nut, lift out the tire.

, Locate four screws near the four corners of the trunk. Remove these screws and lift out the sill plate.


If your vehicle has a cargo net in the trunk, you only need to remove the four screws securing the net. Remove both the net and the sill plate.
If your vehicle does not have a cargo net in the trunk, the four screws you need to remove should be located in the corners of your trunk.
After removing the screws, pull the sill plate up to lift it out of the trunk. Set it and the screws aside in a safe spot while you continue working.

, Grab the front of the shell panel on the right side of the trunk. Pull away enough of this panel to reveal the interior contents it covers.


Pull the panel forward just enough so that it clears the stud located in the back lip of the trunk. After pulling it forward, carefully pull it toward the middle of the trunk, revealing the compartment beneath it.
Note that you do not need to remove this panel completely and doing so is ill-advised.

, The Onstar control box should be a small metal box attached to the side of the vehicle. It will usually be marked with the OnStar logo.


If you do not see the control box, remove the left side panel in the same way you removed the right side panel and check there.
You should be able to do what you need to do with the OnStar control box without actually removing it from the side of the car.

, Locate the three cable connectors on the bottom of the Onstar control box. Pull them straight out to disconnect the system.These three cables provide power to the system and allow the system to communicate with OnStar. Pulling them out should shut down the system and block any additional communication.
You should be able to disconnect the cables by pressing the sides of each plug and pulling it straight out.

, Wind up the three cables and tie them loosely together with cable ties. Position the coil above or beneath the OnStar control box.Coiling the cables will prevent them from getting in the way. It will also make it easier to access the cables again in case you need to reconnect them at some point.

, Work in reverse steps to return all of the removed covers and parts to the trunk.


Push up the side panel until snaps back into place.
Side the sill plate back into the trunk. Make sure that it lines up with the snap holes on the bottom of the side panel you just replaced.
Screw the four sill plate screws back into place.
Return the spare tire to the trunk. Screw the nut back into place, if necessary.
Lay the liner back down over the spare tire compartment.
Close the trunk.

, Start your vehicle's ignition. Pressing the OnStar button beneath the rear view mirror should now result in dead air. If the OnStar light was previously on, it should now be off.


You should also check your other vehicle systems to make sure that none of them were affected. Turn on all lights, radios, and other electric features. Verify that there are no warning lights displayed.

Make sure you have the following tools: 3/8"" drive ratchet, 5/8"" spark plug socket, and a 6"" extension.,
Release the hood latch and open hood.,
Locate the spark plugs.,

Remove spark plugs.,
Check the quality of each spark plug.,

,


The hood release is under the steering wheel.
Be sure the van is off and engine has cooled down if it were driven recently.

,


There are 6 plugs in total.
Cylinders 2,4 and 6 are in sight as soon as you look under the hood. Cylinder 1,3 and 5 are behind the engine when looking from the front of the vehicle. They are difficult to see so some of the work taking them out will require only your sense of touch. If you have not done this sort of work before try removing the spark plugs from cylinders 2,4 and 6 so you get a better feel for what you are doing.

,


Make sure to remember the way the wires are arranged because the timing of spark will change if they are not installed at the correct cylinder.
Gently twist and pull the ignition coil wires to remove.

,


Fit the 5/8"" spark plug socket on the spark plug and loosen it using a ratchet with extension. There is rubber in the socket to hold the spark plug when it unscrews, but still be careful to not hit against something and damage it.
Keep track of which cylinder each spark plug came from. If one spark plug appears with worse condition then you will know what cylinder it belongs to and check for problems there.

,


First make sure they are all the correct brand and design. The manufacturer recommends Champion RE14PLP5 (7440) Double Platinum Spark Plugs.
Look for damage such as cracks and inspect the electrodes that produce the spark for corrosion, excess dirt, and wear.
For the best performance over the life of a spark plug, the gap between the electrodes should be as close to specification as possible. Gap Specification: 1.27mm (0.05""). Place an appropriate size feeler gauge in between the gap and adjust by slightly bending the outer electrode.

,


Depending on how old your plugs are and their condition you may or may not want to replace them. It is important to consider that while modern spark plugs can stay operational for longer, there are many possible causes to obstruct a spark plugs operation. As well, the time it takes to swap out your plugs and the cost if you do it yourself is moderately low for something that could benefit your vehicle's performance.

,


Put the spark plug in the hole it came from using the 5/8"" socket and an extension. Hand tighten it until threaded all the way in to reduce the possibility of cross-threading the plug in the engine block.
If you own a torque wrench then torque the spark plug to 13 ft-lbs (17.5 N.m).
Without a torque wrench tighten by hand then add 1/4 of a full turn with the ratchet.

,


On the ignition coil you will see numbers expressing what cylinder each wire goes to.
Simply push the wires on and you will hear and feel a click when they are connected.

,

Make sure the engine sounds like it is running smoothly and the check engine light does not appear.

Turn the ignition switch to the ON (one more click forward) position in order to exit the keyless entry transmitter mode.,
Operate the transmitter functions in order to verify correct system operation.",How to Program GM Keyless Remotes1," It is necessary for you to be near both the inside locks and the ignition. Make sure you are sitting comfortably in your seat, and that the keyless remote is close enough to the steering wheel and locks.;
, Make sure that each door is shut tightly, otherwise the vehicle will not sync correctly. If you can, give each door handle a yank from the inside to make sure that they are closed as tight as they can be.

, However, do not turn ignition switch yet. This will screw up the cycle you will have to start over.

, This is the switch on the door, not the remote. Do not let up on the lock, otherwise it will mess up the process and force you to restart., Only turn the key as far as it will go before the ignition actually starts the engine. You do not want to start your car. Every time you turn the key to the ON position, a light on the dashboard should appear, and then go away when you turn the key to the OFF position. Do this step quickly.

, The doors will lock and unlock one time to confirm the program mode is activated. If the door only locks, or only unlocks, you will have to start the process over again. Something likely went out of sync, or you did not turn the ignition ON/OFF fast enough., The doors will lock and unlock as you are holding down both buttons to confirm the programming of that transmitter. Do not wait to do this step. You want to do this within ten to twenty seconds after you have shifted the ignition ON/OFF., Once more, do not wait very long in between transmitters. Otherwise you will lose the sync with your car and have to start the process all over again.

, If you forget to do this step, it is likely that your car will not unlock/lock properly., Step out of your car, and go as far as 20 feet. Test the locking mechanism on the transmitter. If it works from that distance, step back another 20 feet (40 feet in total) and try it from there. If you are noticing it not working, you may have to restart the sync cycle over again. It may also indicate the battery is low.

, Sit down comfortably in the driver's seat, and make sure that all of the doors are closed. Tug on each of the handles from inside to make sure they are all closed tight. Make sure that your transmitter is close to the steering wheel and lock buttons.

, Put your key in the ignition and turn it all the way clockwise until you hear the engine come on. Make sure that the gear shift is set to park.

, If for some reason the display does not appear, restart your car, and repeat the previous steps. If the display still does not appear, contact your nearest GM car care professional., The Set/Reset button should be near the Vehicle Information button. If you cycle past the option, continue pressing the Set/Reset button until the ""Remote Key Learning Active"" option reappears., Do this for at least fifteen seconds. You should hear a noise that sounds like a chime. This means that your transmitter has been successfully synced. If that does not happen, it is likely the sync is off, in which case you will have to restart the process.

, Do this in rapid succession. If you wait too long, it is likely that your car will go out of sync, and you will have to restart the process for whichever transmitters you have left over.

, It is important that you do this, otherwise the lock/unlock features in your car will not properly work. This can result in dangerous circumstances where your locks do not work. If you forget, or take too long to take your key out, start the whole process over again for your own safety and convenience., Get out of your car and close the driver's door. Step away from the car about 20 feet. Press the unlock/lock buttons separately. If they work from this distance, step back to a further distance and try your transmitter from there. If you are noticing that your transmitter is not locking and/or unlocking, start the process over again to ensure that it works. If you have repeated the process numerous times with no success, contact your car care professional for further instruction/help.


If the transmitter works at 20 feet but does not work at, say, 40 feet, the transmitter may not have a strong enough signal to travel that far, or that the transmitter's batteries are low.

Learn the CB codes and lingo.Once you get the hang of using your radio, you should ""peak"" your behaviour on the air.,
Consider an alternative to upgrading your CB radio.Some modern radios are much stronger by default than CB.",How to Peak and Tune a CB Radio," While a radio will be the most important part of your shopping trip, there are some other thing you'll want to look into picking up as well.


The radio itself. Most CB radios are 4 Watts and under by default. A microphone should come with the radio package.An antenna. The antenna is the most important part of your radio's setup.Fibreglass antennae are often preferable because they are tunable.
A SWR meter. A SWR meter will help you measure the radio's output. This is a vital part of tuning your antenna to the radio.
Coaxial cables. A coaxial cable is needed to connect the antenna to the radio. Another cable may be needed if you're hooking it up to an SWR meter.
Batteries. Many CB radios are battery powered (hand-held). When you purchase a CB radio, check what type of batteries it uses and purchase a supply of them.;
, A SWR (Standing Wave Radio) reader can be hooked up like an adaptor between the antenna and the radio itself.Throughout your tunings, you'll want to check this meter periodically. Generally speaking, you'll want the SWR to read as low as possible. High ratings will seriously limit your radio's performance, and possibly risk even damaging it.


Generally speaking, a SWR reading of 2.0:1 (or lower) across all channels is acceptable., Antennae are typically very easy to mount on a car. You'll maximize your range if you put it up on the highest place possible. Most antennae are magnetically-based, which makes them a case of sticking it where you want. Once you mount the antenna, link the antenna to your radio with a coaxial cable.


You can add a quick-release mount to attach the antenna onto the car with. This makes it a lot easier to attach and remove the antenna at will., Tuning a CB radio means fixing the antenna. Sometimes, the antenna will need to be adjusted to get the optimal signal. Most fibreglass antennae have detachable segments at the top to allow for extensions, so antennae can be lengthened that way. Antennae can also be shorted by sawing the antenna down as needed.If Channel 1 on your SWR is greater than Channel 40, it means your antenna is too short. Conversely, if Channel 40 is greater than 1, it means it's too long.
When setting up the antenna, you'll want your SWR levels below 2.0. You'll also want Channels 1 and 40 to read identical to one another.(Edit: Using an amplifier with a CB is HIGHLY ILLEGAL.)

, From there, you can ensure your frequencies are accurate by giving a Channel a test-run.

, Because models differ, the owner’s manual will help you identify parts for adjustments. Some suggestions to peak your radio are below, but only try them if you’re electronically adept and you have an older CB. If you're trying anything advanced with the CB radio, you should first make sure you know all of the basics.


If your CB radio has been manufactured within the last few years, you won’t need to peak it. Newer models don’t have the drift and adjustment problems of older CBs. Any modification to newer models, such as producing higher wattage, usually puts the CB into illegal territory where the FCC is concerned.

, Properly testing and tuning a radio should have as little signal noise around it as possible. Open areas also give CB radio the best possible range.


Everyone must remain inside with the doors closed while you take readings. On the other hand, if you have a base CB unit, test it in place.

, It can be linked up via coaxial cable via the antenna input.

, The modulation should be adjustable via the body of the CB radio. Tweaking the modulation is a good way of maximizing power but you'll only want to up it to a certain degree. Make sure the sound of the radio isn't being distorted by the extent of your modulation.

, Squelch refers to a background noise-cancelling function of a CB radio.Squelch can be adjusted via a knob on CB radios with the function included. Adjust the squelch to a point where the noise is minimized but the rest of your sound is relatively untouched.


RF gain is a more modern alternative to squelch radio, and it serves roughly the same purpose., Peaking the particulars of your CB radio are only really recommended if you have a lot of experience with radio equipment. Otherwise, it can save a lot of trouble to take it to a store. From there, a specialist can work out the kinks and get it up to its peak efficiency.


Check the web for reviews of the store before giving them your radio. It has been reported that some radio stores will fall short when it comes to handling CB radios., If you know someone else with a CB radio, you should enlist their help. Tune into the same channel as your friend, and try to have a conversation. From the other's person's responses, you should get a reasonable idea what your transmissions are like. From there, experiment with different ranges and channels.


Ironically, having someone on the other line via cellphone and communicating that way can be helpful if you're still in the midst of troubleshooting your radio setup.

, Even though CB is only used by a select group of people at this point, there's still a dynamic culture, complete with its own jargon and inside jokes.


Be aware of CB ""trolls"" that occupy radio channels. They use the anonymity of radio to lash offensive slurs and rile people up for amusement.Channel 9 is declared by the FCC as the official channel for emergencies. If you want to contact with anyone on an official basis, you should read up on some of the codes. They are sometimes specific to a certain region, so it may take specific researching on your part.

, Internet radio is also available, and potentially transmits much further. It should also be mentioned that CB radio lots its popularity with the advent of cellphones. If you're needing to communicate for largely practical reasons, you should rely on a phone or the internet.

Get a tachometer and splicing connectors.,
Adjust the tachometer for the number of cylinders in your engine.,
Locate the output wire from your distributor.,
Test the connection.,
Choose a mounting location for the tachometer.,
Install the tachometer.,
Install a grommet in the firewall.,
Set the shift light on the tachometer if applicable.",How to Install a Tachometer," You can either buy a tachometer new, which usually run somewhere between $30 and $50, or salvage on old one for relatively cheap and install it into your car.


The only other specialty item you'll need to complete the job is a package of quick-splice connectors, which are usually only a few dollars at the auto part store. The wires are about 16-18 gauge usually, so get connectors of the appropriate size.;
, New tachometers may be set to work on 4-, 6- or 8- cylinder engines by removing the back cap of the tachometer to reveal the cylinder setting switches inside.Set the cylinder switches to match the number of cylinders in your engine. Replace the end cap of the tachometer carefully to avoid pinching any of the internal tachometer wires. Use a screwdriver to refasten the end cap if necessary.
Generally, there will be two switches--a 1 and a 2. Most of the time, both switches should be down for a 4 cylinder engine, while both should be up for an 8 cylinder. In a 6 cylinder engine, most of the time the 2 switch should be up and the 1 should be down. If you get a new tachometer, read the instructions to be sure.

, Depending on your engine, there may be a constant-flow wire and a pulse wire to the tach, as well as the additional wires for the ignition, lights, and other components. It's important to make sure you've got the correct wire for the tachometer, which means you might need to use a multimeter with a tach setting to test the wires correctly, and consult the shop manual for your engine.


It's also important to note that some new tachometers are incompatible with solid-core spark plug wires and can be dangerous to connect without following the proper installation instructions for the tach.

, Before you mount it in the steering column, it's a good idea to hook up the wiring and and test it out while you rev the engine, to make sure it works. You don't want to go drilling holes in your steering column before you're sure you've got the wiring figured out. After you hook it up to the proper wires from the distributor and ground it correctly, it should give you an accurate reading of your RPMs as you rev the engine.


Ground the tachometer. Attach the tachometer ground wire to an engine ground of the car. This need not be directly on the battery. Much of the car frame is grounded to the battery by sturdy wires. Trace those wires to find a suitable attachment point.
Attach the tachometer pickup wire. The tachometer wire must be fed through a grommet in the passenger compartment to reach the engine compartment. This attachment point will vary from engine to engine.

, Most cars won't have an in-dash mounting location available, so it's usually best to mount your tach on the steering column.


Drill holes in the steering column and use the mounting bracket supplied with the tachometer, or rig your own. Directions for mounting typically are provided with new tachometers, as well as any necessary pieces.






Bracket mount the tachometer on the steering column. Fabricate or find a secure mounting bracket that will support the tachometer mounting points. Attach the bracket to the steering column. A simple U bracket would suffice for this.







, Apply power to the tachometer by attaching the power input wire of the tachometer to the 12-volt dashboard lighting supply of the car.


Provide power to the tachometer backlighting. Locate the 12-volt switched dash lighting supply for the dashboard on the car fuse box. Attach the tachometer backlighting wire.

, It's a good idea to install a rubber grommet where the wire(s) pass through the firewall as part of your installation. If the wires rub up against the bare metal, it can cause a fire hazard or at least a short. It's best to be on the safe side and work a grommet in, which will only cost a few dollars and take a few minutes at the most.

, This light will remind you that it is recommended to change gears at the current RPM. Not all tachometers have the shift light feature. If your chosen tachometer does, follow the installation instructions to properly set the shift light. The shift light cannot be set if the engine is running."

Decide what features are needed.,
Research models of entry systems online.,
Consult your dealer.,
If you are mechanically inclined, install the new keyless entry system yourself.,
Check for proper function.,
For extra convenience, the keyless entry remote can be rigged to control an ignition switch to turn the car on remotely.

",How to Install a Remote Keyless Entry System in a Truck," Before you investigate further, decide what features will work best for you. Key entry systems can be for the driver's side door only, or they can be for all passenger doors. Make sure you know which system is right for you.;
, Different models will have different features, but be prepared to spend more on more popular or praised systems. Check different websites and discussion boards dealing with both keyless entry systems and your specific trunk model to learn about the systems from those currently using them.

, If possible, talk to your auto dealer about which brands of systems work better in your particular truck. The dealer will also be able to give you information about standard factory keyless entry systems and factory installation.

,


Read the instructions. Not all models of keyless entry systems are the same, so be sure to read the instructions so you know the exact limits and specs of your system.
Disconnect your truck's battery. This is crucial and will prevent any electric discharge and possible shock later in the process.
Attach the keyless entry system to the underside of the dash. Make sure it is securely fastened with zip ties. Also fasten any stray wires with zip ties to insure they won't come loose. Be sure the system is placed where it will not interfere with other systems, such as air conditioning or breaks.
Consult your truck owner's manual to find which color wires control which door locking mechanisms. Once you have located these wires, solder them to the appropriate wires on your keyless entry system. Tape them with electrical tape to insure the wires stay together and maintain a connection.
The keyless entry system requires a constant power supply. One close source of power is the ignition switch wiring. Locate this using your owner's manual and solder the red power wire from your entry system to the ignition switch.

, Lock and unlock your doors to make sure the new system works.

You will want a starter that is compatible with your anti-theft system and secure.









If it is not compatible with your anti-theft system, you will have to buy additional costly anti-theft bypass modules.;
, Installation instructions vary according to different brands and models of remote starters. It is important to carefully read the installation instructions and find the wiring diagrams for your particular starter.









If you choose a used unit or one that does not include directions, check out online instructions before making a purchase. Make sure the website is easy to use and has complete, printable directions and wiring diagrams that clearly show how to install a remote starter in your car.

, Become familiar with the wires in your vehicle by looking over the manual and repair guides. Some standard wire connections include the starter, ignition, power and accessory controls like heat and air conditioning, security or alarm system, radio and power locks.








, Consult your manuals to determine which tools you will need for your particular starter and vehicle. You may require a utility knife, wire cutters, wire strippers, soldering iron and solder, electrical tape, digital multimeter, wrenches and/or screwdrivers. A digital multimeter is recommended for testing during and after installation.









Some remote starters will come with all the necessary tools so check your box. For example, many systems come with an LED circuit tester to find the necessary wires for installation.
It is recommended that you solder all your wires together to form better connections. If you choose to solder you will need a soldering iron and safety glasses.

, It must be in a secure, hidden location that won’t require extending the supplied wires. The usual position is inside the lower dash underneath the steering wheel. This way you can connect directly to the ignition wiring.









Don’t place it in the engine compartment or any area where it will be exposed to extreme vibration or heat.
Possible alternative locations include spaces above the radio or glove compartment, the center console and above the dashboard fuse box.

, Check the battery, switches, lights and other systems. If any electrical systems are not working correctly then you should fix them prior to beginning your installation.








, Removing the seat will give you more room to work while installing the system. If you cannot remove the seat then slide the chair all the way backwards.








, When working on the electrical system of your vehicle it is safer to disconnect the battery to prevent any shocks. To test the wires you will need to have the battery connected but disconnect it while you are soldering wires together to be safe. When testing the wiring with the battery connected, make sure you do not probe any air bag circuit. Most of these are encased in a yellow cover for safety.








, Use a screwdriver to remove the panel covering the underside of the steering column. This is where you will access the wires to connect the starter.









If the panel is not attached with screws then you might require a socket set to remove nuts securing the panel.
Depending on your vehicle you may also need to remove the lower steering column cover to access the ignition switch harness. If your vehicle has an anti theft system, it is likely that you will need to remove this cover.
If you choose to connect your remote starter to other functions such as the door locks and overhead lights then you will need to remove the kick panel as well. This is located on the lower left-hand corner of the driver’s foot box.

, It is very important that you securely connect all your wires. Loose wires can cause injury or major property damage. It is best to solder all your connections to ensure that they are strong. You should also use heat shrink tubing where possible and a good quality electrical tape where you cannot.









To connect wires first strip away about 1/2-1 inch (1-2.5 cm) of the coating around the wire. If there are two wires then split them and insert the attaching wire between them. Wrap the attaching wire around the stripped wire and solder them together using the soldering iron. Once they are securely attached, wrap electrical tape around the connection and use ties to hold them in place. Lightly tug on the wires to make sure they do not become loose.

, The ground wire will be part of the starter and is often black. Connect this by screwing through the ring terminal into a clean, unpainted metal surface in the kick panel area. This wire is very important for the proper functioning of your vehicle.









Because it is so important, it is better to connect the ground wire to a location in the kick panel as opposed to being close to the ignition switch in the dash. Also, it is better to use a separate grounding location to prevent feedback through wiring that may cause computer failures.

, The 12V constant wire is the one attached to the battery and is usually found in the bundle of wires attached to the ignition switch. You can locate this wire by reading the vehicle’s manual and repair guides or testing with the multimeter.









If you see any yellow or otherwise noticeable wires, do not touch them! These are the airbag wires and must not be tampered with or unplugged.
To test the power wires using the multimeter attach it to the wire when the car is off and the key is out of the ignition. It should read around 12V (or the battery voltage) constantly.
Some vehicles will have more than one 12V constant wire. In this case identify which is fused at a higher number of amps and attach your primary power wire to this one. If your starter has two power wires, attach the second power wire on the starter to the additional 12V constant wire.
Use a soldering iron to connect all wires. This keeps them from falling apart and potentially damaging your vehicle. Add further protection by taping them completely.

, The accessory wire supplies power to heat and air conditioning controls and supplies 12V when the key is in the first (accessory) position. Attach the accessory wire on the starter to the accessory wire on the vehicle.









To find this wire attach the multimeter while the key is in the “off” position. The voltage should be zero in this position. Turn the key into the first position but no farther. If you have found your accessory wire, the voltage will now read around 12V (11.5-14V). Check that the voltage goes to zero ‘while’ you are cranking the engine (it will read 12V before and after cranking).Some vehicles might have more than one accessory wire to control all the functions. In this case use a relay to connect additional wires.

, The ignition wire supplies power to the fuel pump and ignition system and will be attached to the ignition switch under the steering wheel. The vehicle manual or repair guides should tell you which color this wire should be. Connect the ignition output wire on the remote starter to this wire.









Once you have located this wire you can confirm its identity using the multimeter. Attach the multimeter to the wire while it is connected to a good ground wire and it should show no voltage. Turn the key to the first position and the voltage should still read zero. In the second position, before starting the car, there should be a voltage displayed on your multimeter. If there is, then you have identified the correct wire, if not then you must try again to locate your ignition wire.
Some vehicles have more than one ignition wire. If so, use a relay to connect all additional ignition wires.

, This will only show a voltage while the vehicle is being cranked, or turned on. It supplies power to the starter solenoid when turning your vehicle on. Connect the starter wire output on your remote starter to this wire by soldering the wires together.









Locate a potential starter wire to test with the multimeter. The voltage should be zero when the key is in all positions except while cranking the engine. If you think you have found the wire, start with the key in position two and then crank the engine. The voltage should read zero while the key is in position two, show 12V while cranking and then go back to zero if you release the key before the engine turns over., The brake wire is usually found at the switch harness above the brake pedal but can also be found along with the parking light wires in the kick panel on the way to the rear of the vehicle. Connect these wires to the parking light and brake output wires on the remote starter.









To find the brake wire press the brake pedal down while the car is on and use the multimeter to test the wire. The multimeter should read between 11.5-14V while the brake is pressed down.
The brake wires in particular are important to connect because they prevent someone from driving off in your car while it is running from the remote starter.

, This is required by the remote starter so that it disengages the starter once the car has started. It can usually be found in the engine distributor or coil pack.









To locate the tachometer wire look for the engine distributor by following the spark plug wires to where they junction at a distributor and find a small wire harness which should have a tachometer reference. Alternatively see the owner’s manual to determine the recommended tachometer wire’s location.

, Some systems might have additional steps for connecting to the door locks of the vehicle. Others might need a special system for getting around the anti-theft system that exists in your car. As always consult the manual or manufacturer of your remote sensor to find out which extra features your system has and where you should connect them.









To connect to the door locks you can locate the wires in the driver’s side door. You may need an external relay, of which there are many different kinds. However the four most common include positive trigger, negative trigger, reverse polarity and multiplex door lock systems. Consult your vehicle manual or repair guides to determine which system your vehicle uses.

, A relay allows multiple wires to be connected together. There are many different designs, shapes and sizes but they all perform the same basic function. Connect the wires to the relay by wrapping them around the pins.








, This will protect the wires and make the installation look tidy and neat.








, Test your remote start and keyless entry systems as well as your brakes and brake lights to make sure everything has been connected properly and is working. If something fails to work, go back and check all the wires you have connected to see what went wrong.









Make sure you test your vehicle to make sure it will start, run, and drive using your key normally. This will insure the installation did not affect any normal vehicle operations or cause any dash lights to illuminate abnormally.

, Push the remote sensor and the wiring into the compartment and cover with the panel. Screw (or ratchet) the panel into place. Make sure not to pinch or screw into any wiring during installation.

You will also probably find it in local shops from $50-$60. There are other radios from Midland, Radioshack with similar dimensions. (Prices as at Sept 2007, feel free to update.);
, A good location would be under the AC controls alongside of the cigarette lighter. When taking the plastic off you’ll see that you’d have to cut into the wall behind the plastic, it’s not deep enough to fit the radio. It’s possible but not quick, and the mic cord would be in the way of the transfer case shifter. Other ideas:


On YouTube, there’s a video where someone mounted it behind the plastic below the steering wheel. There’s a lot of room but no way to adjust volume and change the channels without pulling down the cover which can’t be done while driving.
Consider the side of the driver’s seat. This is a good compromise to have a quick install and will only fit the smallest Cobra or other CB. Mag light mounts are often seen here also.

, This is probably suitable in cars that have power seats but perfect for the lower bolt.

, Line the mount up vertical then drill a hole into the frame to install a top bolt and nut on the frame. The radio can only be screwed into the mount from the top. It's a tight fit. With two bolts through the mount and seat frame it’ll hold strong. Do this step first so you can place the radio in position and get locations for the wiring.

, There’s a hole in the carpet by the front driver’s side seat, insert you power wire for the radio below this running it under the carpet toward the hood release. You’ll have to pull out the plastic trim to get it there.

, Acknowledging that this is quick and dirty version, you can take a little shortcut to wire. Purchase a mini and add a fuse wire. This is a wire mounted to a mini fuse adapter that goes into the fuse box slot and accepts a mini fuse on top of it (10 amp). The inside fuse box, located on the driver's side of the dash has a few spare slots but none of them are wired to the box. In one case, where the Manual denoted that the fuse for the rear 12v outlet was missing, it worked fine - just plug it into the fuse box, plug the fuse in then the power cable. For the ground, locate the (two) bolts with ground wires and put my ground wire on one. There is static from the fuse box and ground if settings are all the way up but when you have a good signal the CB is still clear.

, This is a hard one but try mounting the mike on the left side of the steering wheel. This keeps the mike control on the same side as the CB radio. It's another tight fit, so check that the door will close properly before you drill the holes. With the mike installed here, you can’t get in and out of the jeep, without seeing and almost tripping over the wire. To eliminate this, stick the wire under the plastic trim above the hood release, down the side under the plastic at the door and come out right at the CB radio. It'll look clean, always mounted and never in the doorway by your feet and if you stretch it tight, you'll have enough cord to reach your head easily.

, However, if the CB is ever removed the mike holes will be the only visible trace of this whole CB install.

, Now that the CB is wired up and working you can get to the antenna cable. Drill a small hole an the bottom of the plastic trim where the cable will exit into the trim. This is so when the plastic trim is installed over the cable it doesn’t pinch the cable. Run the cable through the plastic trim to the rear seat belt bolts they’ll be a break in the carpet. Then lower the set and run it under the carpet alongside the rest of the rear wiring. Once it hits the rear remove the plastic trim and run it up the driver’s side rear corner plastic until it’s just above the rear glass level. Bring it out of the plastic. It’ll hang from under the glass and weather stripping but if you ever sell the liberty it’s an easy uninstall with no drilled hole to patch or seal later.

, By now everything is installed and in place, except for mounting the CB antenna. Although there are better ways to fabricate a mount, a homemade solution is this:


Buy a trailer hitch wiring kit with mounting bracket included. This is USD$10 at Walmart. The mounting bracket is a small ""L"" shape. Inspect it, make sure the mounting bracket looks strong, at least 1/8” metal, remember this piece is why you are buying the kit.
There are 4 mounting holes on the corners and one big one in the middle. If you drill the two opposite holes (top left and bottom right) wide enough, they’ll fit the screw for the antenna mount and the bolt from rear tire mount. With an antenna spring in between the antenna, it’s strong enough to hold the antenna and easily replaceable. Original author has 4' fiberglass antenna; it sways but stays.

Read the warranty information on both your vehicle and the remote starter system.,
Check with your current vehicle warranty information.,
Watch for a transmitter range when you choose a remote car starter.,
Keep an eye out for information about the engine speed sensing mechanism of the remote car starter.,
Find a remote car starter with a cutoff safety switch under the hood.,
Consider installing keyless entry with your starter if your vehicle doesn’t have it.,
Find a remote car starter system that offers a security system as part of the installation process.,
Add a few other remote car starter features that may not come standard on every unit.,
Make sure to find a system that is perfect for your needs and has life-time warranty.",How to Choose a Remote Car Starter,"


Many companies will guarantee the remote starter for as long as you own the vehicle. While the system is under a warranty, the remote itself is rarely warranted for more than a year or two, so find out what the remote replacement cost will be.;
, A dealer cannot void a warranty if equipment is added. It is against the law. The dealer can however, void the warrant if the installation of the equipment causes any damage to the vehicle. A professional remote starter company and shop should be used to avoid any damage and void of your warranty.

,


Don’t buy a starter with a shorter range than you need.
Consider the trips to the mall, movies and restaurants when choosing a range. You may find you wish you had gone with a larger minimum range for these occasions.

,


The monitor will watch your engine’s RPMs to avoid damaging your vehicle if the engine has problems when starting.
The RPM sensor will also tell the starter that the car has actually not started on a very cold day and try to restart it again. Without the sensor, your starter your vehicle will be cold when you get there.

,


It’s very important to have a cutoff switch installed under the hood so anytime the hood is open the starter can be manually turned off to avoid injury when working on the vehicle.

, If you have manufacturer keyless entry, you may consider adding the remote starter keyless entry feature with your remote starter. The starter usually has a much wider range making it a lot easier to lock or unlock your doors from farther away.

, The security system can even be added to vehicles that already have manufacturer security.

,



Heated seats are an option that can be put in with the car starter. Not only will your vehicle be warm on a cold winter day, your seat will be nice and comfortable too.
Add rear window defrost so your windows are thawed and ready to go without having to wait for the heat of the car to do it or scrape them yourself.
Look for anti-grind features that save your engine from a mistaken key turn once in your vehicle. Even if you have your starter for years, the tendency to get in and turn the key is still there. The anti-grind feature will save your starter on those days when you forget your vehicle is on and try to turn the key.
The car alarm for finding a vehicle is another easy addition to a car starter unit. The horn will sound with a click of a button so you can find your vehicle in large parking lots.

, Several systems now come with a 2 way remote which will have longer range and will actually confirm that your car started on your remote.

Choose a single- or multiple-button starter


Single-button remote car starters function solely to start the SUV when you're not in it.,
Evaluate warranty options.,
Install it where you buy it.,
Check transmitter range.,
Include a hood safety switch.,
Purchase engine speed detection.",How to Buy a Remote Starter for an SUV," These starters are less expensive and inexpensive to have installed.
Multiple-button car starters start your SUV and can lock and unlock doors. Some multiple-button starters are equipped to turn on window defrosters and seat warmers. These are more expensive than single-button starters and are more prone to technical problems, but provide a higher level of convenience.;
,


Mechanics recommend getting a remote automobile starter with a warranty that will last as long as you expect to own your SUV. Buy a car starter with a warranty package that protects against faulty installation or electrical malfunctions.

,


The specialists that sell you your starter are well-trained in the installation process. There will be an additional fee for installation, but you can be assured that the starter will be installed properly.

,


Remote starters vary in transmission range. Inexpensive single-button starters typically have a range of 100 (30 m), while more intricate starters can have a range of up to 1,000 feet (300 m). Consider where you typically park your SUV at home, work and when shopping to determine what range will work best for you.

,


A hood safety switch is an optional safety feature that can be installed with most remote car starters. It prevents the starter from starting your SUV when the vehicle's hood is up.
Many car specialists opt not to install the hood safety switch unless specifically requested. Be sure to ask about this feature when you're having your starter installed.

,


Starters with engine speed detection can read a car's engine RPMs, or revolutions per minute. This will allow your starter to detect if the SUV fails to start when prompted due to cold weather or engine malfunction. Starters with this feature can also turn your SUV off if it is detected that the engine is running too fast, preventing engine damage.

Pick oil-based sport shocks for a cheap option.,
Choose gas-charged shocks for a smoother ride.,
Use MacPherson struts for a highly compatible model.,
Buy coil-over sport shocks if you value adjustability.,
Pick strut cartridges for easily replaceable sport shocks.,
Determine the sport shock size you need.,
Shop at local auto stores.,
Check your local classified ads.,
Visit auto salvage shops.,
Shop online.,
Get new shocks if you car shows early warning signs of shock absorption damage.,
Buy new sport shocks immediately if your car acts up while driving.,
Determine how much your car hauls.,
Choose sport shocks if your car struggles with bumpy roads.",How to Buy Sport Shocks," Oil-based sport shocks are filled with hydraulic fluid that absorbs pressure placed on your vehicle. Oil-based shocks are more affordable and generally more durable. They are a good choice if you hope to have your vehicle for a long time.Oil-based sport shocks do not provide as smooth a ride as gas-charged alternatives. If your car rides on extremely bumpy roads, oil-based shocks might not be your best option.;
, Although pricier, gas-charged shocks are best if your car drives on rural roads a lot. Gas-charged sport shocks contains nitrogen gas in one end of the cylinder. When the nitrogen gas mixes with the hydraulic oil as pressure increases, it prevents the oil from foaming and maintains shock absorbency.Both gas-charged and oil-based shocks use hydraulic oil: the main difference is that gas-charged shocks heavily rely on nitrogen gas.

, These sport shocks work by connecting to the car's ball joint, which gives the vehicle more room in the engine compartment. MacPherson struts work with a variety of vehicle makes and models because of its simplistic design. If you're installing the shocks on your own, you may prefer these shocks.Because of their affordable cost, MacPherson struts are also best if you're on a budget.

, Coil-over shocks adopt well to your car's model and are great for custom modifications (especially if you want a ""lowrider"" car). They work by wrapping the shock absorber in a coil spring, which gives the vehicle support as it handles jolts and bumps.Some drivers complain that coil-over shocks make for a stiff, unpleasant ride. Quality coil-over shocks vary with price: cheaper coil-overs will likely compromise shock absorption.

, Strut cartridges are inexpensive and easily replaced when damaged or worn. If you've never replaced shock absorbers before, strut cartridges are very beginner-friendly. Strut cartridges work by inserting itself into the strut housing and muffling road bumps.

Strut cartridges can be of lower quality than some shock absorbers. Decide whether quality or cost is most important to you.

, Keep in mind what effect shock absorbers will have on your vehicle's clearance. Sport shocks can lower the clearance slightly, so consider the height difference before buying the shocks. Contact a mechanic or your vehicle user manual if you're unsure what your clearance levels are., Talk with the store employees about different sport shocks and the benefits of each model. If the store doesn't have the style you want, ask employees about their recommendations and whether they know of other sellers.

Ask about the store's warranty policies. You will want reassurance in case your sport shocks break prematurely.

, Car owners often advertise used auto parts in online or newspaper classifieds. If you find someone selling shock absorbers, ask them if you can meet to inspect the car part for any damages. If the sport shocks are in good condition, negotiate a fair price with the seller.

Ask the seller why they no longer need their sport shocks. This can help you determine the condition and reliability of the shock absorbers.

, Junkyards often sell used car parts at a low price. Call a local salvage shop beforehand and ask if they have sport shocks in stock. Talk with salvage yard employees and ask them for a quote. After you've verified the shock absorbers' condition, you can then purchase the sport shocks at an inexpensive price.Some salvage yards may offer return policies within a certain time period. Others mark all sales as final. Ask shop employees about their policy, and decide whether the condition is worth any potential risks.

, Check online retailers that sell shock absorbers new or used. If your car model is rare and only works with certain shocks, you may have more luck finding sport shocks on the internet. Review your retailer's shipping and returns policies before you buy, and make sure to ask the seller for pictures to determine its condition.

Check auction sites such as eBay for new or used sport shocks at a reduced price. Review the seller's feedback and selling history before you bid to make sure the product is trustworthy.

, Inspect your vehicle for signs that you need new shock absorbers. If your shocks are leaking oil around the seals or the mountain bolts are loose, your shock absorbers are likely damaged.Push your vehicle down in one of the corners. If it bounces excessively, your shock absorbers are worn.

, If your car starts to show warning signs while driving, you should get your shock absorbers replaced immediately. The longer you wait to replace them, the greater your risk of vehicle damage. Cars that rock back and forth after stopping, sway while changing lanes, or drifts to the left or right at high speeds likely need new shock absorbers., What kind of sports shocks you'll need depends on the size of your vehicle and how often it transports heavy loads. If you drive a large vehicle (like a truck or SUV), choose more durable, heavy-duty shocks.

Keep your location in mind, too. Avoid buying heavy-duty shocks if you usually drive on highways or urban roads.

, Shock absorbers are used to absorb vibration caused by road bumps or pot holes, and different shocks work on different terrain. Traditionally, sport shocks are used by sporting drivers who need increased smoothness and control on the road.

Those who drive on particularly rough roads (such as off-terrain vehicle drivers or people in rural cities) can also benefit from sport shocks.

This can include plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) and hydrogen internal combustion engines (hydrogen ICE). In order to qualify as a TZEV, each car must:meet California’s most stringent tailpipe emission standard
have zero evaporative emissions
have a 15 yr/150,000 mile warranty on the emissions system, and
have a 10 yr/150,000 mile warranty on the zero emission energy storage system.;
, The California Air Resources Board (ARB) issues decals to certain model vehicles that satisfy legislative requirements for low pollution emissions. You can check the list on the ARB website to see if your car qualifies.


From the main ARB website, www.ARB.CA.gov, select the link to “Carpool Stickers” under the Popular Pages heading. This will take you to the list of eligible vehicles.

, The list of eligible cars includes models from 1991 through the present. The list is very specific, first reporting the manufacturer names and then the individual models that qualify. The list further reports the exhaust standard, fuel type, engine size and engine family number for each eligible vehicle.Note the color decal that your car is eligible to receive. When you find your car listed, you will see that each car is marked as either a green decal or a white decal. These are based on the type of exhaust standard the car has. Green or white decals are the same for driving privileges.

, If you have further questions about any particular vehicle and its eligibility for the decal program, you can call the Air Resources Board helpline.


The phone number for the ARB helpline is (800) 242-4450.

, You can pick up an application form in person at any California DMV office. Alternatively, you can download a copy of the form from the www.dmv.ca.gov website.From the main DMV website, first select the link to Vehicle Registration, and then to Vehicle Registration Forms, and then find the Application for Clean Air Vehicle Decals.
If you have more than one qualifying vehicle, you will need a separate application form for each one.

, You will need to fill in the car’s license plate number, vehicle identification number (VIN) and year, make and model., If more than one person jointly owns the vehicle, both people can apply on the one application form. For each owner of the vehicle, you will be asked to provide the following information:Full name, as it appears on the car’s title and registration
Driver’s license number
Residence or business address
Mailing address, if different from residence or business address

, Section 2 of the application form contains three columns. In each column, you are required to mark at least one box to indicate your selection.In the first column, mark whether this application is for a new decal, a transfer, an information correction or update, or a replacement.
In the second column, you are to select either a white decal or a green decal. This choice is decided by the type of exhaust standard that your car has. If you have any questions about this, you can check the “Carpool Stickers” eligibility list from the ARB website. That list identifies the exhaust standard for each car.
In the third column, you will select the white or green decal, based on your car’s motive power. The options are electric, hydrogen fuel cell, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, plug-in hybrid, or a conversion to alternate fuel.

, This section is specifically for owners of Enhanced AT PZEVs or TZEVs, and only if you are seeking a replacement decal for a previous car that has been declared a total loss or unrepairable. If this applies to you, you will provide the old vehicle’s license plate, VIN, year, make and model., You will need to provide information about the original decals. In particular, you will have to select from a list the reason for the replacement (stolen, lost, damaged, or not received from a prior owner), and include a written statement of facts to explain the situation., As a final step, you must print and sign your name. You are also asked to provide the date of the application and a daytime telephone number where you can be reached in case the DMV has any questions., If you choose to submit the application in person, you can take it to any DMV office. Alternatively, you can mail it to DMV, Special Processing Unit - MS D238, P.O. Box 932345, Sacramento, CA 94232-3450.There is a fee of $8 that must accompany the application. If you are submitting your application by mail, you should include a check made payable to the California DMV.
If you are applying for a green decal, do not include the $8 fee with your application. The state has reached the authorized limit for green decals. If the legislature extends that limit, then additional green decals will be issued.

, Under normal circumstances, your CAV decal should arrive within about 30 days after you submit your application. If your decal does not arrive within that time, you may call the DMV office to check on the status of your application.


The original legislation put a limit on the number of green decals that would be awarded. That number has been extended, but the current cap has been exceeded. You may apply, if you wish, but applications for green decals are being held until more decals become available., When you receive your decal, you will also receive a placement guide to direct you where to place the decal on your car. You are supposed to place one decal on each rear quarter panel of the car, behind each rear wheel., With your decals properly affixed to the car, you are eligible to drive in the California HOV lanes, regardless of the number of passengers in the car.

, If you will be driving in certain areas of San Francisco, you will also need to have a Fastrack transponder in order to drive in express lanes.

Check the fit.",How to Fit Car Mats," Most people opt for standard fit car mats, but if you're a bit more particular about what goes into your car, there are more advanced options to pick from, too.Standard fit mats are the least expensive and will usually work with any car that hasn't been customized. You should be able to find them in any store that sells automobile accessories. Some standard fit mats are universal by car type (subcompact car, compact car, minivan, SUV, pickup truck, etc.) while others are universal by both car type and car manufacturer.
Improved fit mats are similar to standard fit mats in the generalized method of sizing used, but the materials and dimensions are designed in a way that allows them to fit the space in your car more securely.
Vehicle-specific car mats are a little more expensive, but they're a good option for someone who wants a high-quality mat that is still commercially available. These car mats are designed for a specific make and model of automobile, so the dimensions should fit your specific vehicle very accurately. You can usually find these mats at car dealerships and some automotive stores.
Fully customized car mats are the most expensive, and you'll need to locate a business that specializes in making them since they aren't commercially available. You will need to provide your car's specific measurements when placing an order (please see the ""Measure for Custom Car Mats"" section).;
, Type refers to the overall quality of the floor mat. Someone who lives in a temperate climate and only uses the car for leisure will need a different quality than someone who regularly drags heavy, muddy work boots into a truck used while on the job.Standard car mats are the most basic. They protect the car floor against most liquids, but that's about all they do.
All-weather car mats are a little more durable. They can protect the floor from liquids and stay in place a little more securely. As such, the mats don't slip around as much when the weather gets nasty, so the odds of getting mud on the floor are lessened.
Cargo liners are liquid-proof and stay in place as well as all-weather mats, but they're made from materials that are more rigid than all-weather mats, making them slightly more durable.
Carpeted mats fit into your car securely, but they only offer minimal protection against liquids; they are not liquid-proof, strictly speaking.
Rubber mats are liquid proof and stay in place very securely. They can dry and crack when exposed to extremely hot or sunny conditions, though.
Heavy-duty mats are liquid proof and fit into your vehicle very securely. They're also extra thick, which adds an extra layer of protection.
Metal car mats are liquid proof and very durable, but they tend to slip around instead of fitting securely.

, The two main backing styles include flat backs and gripper backs. Both options have advantages and disadvantages.


Flat backs generally have a non-skid coating to help prevent slippage, but this coating may not be as effective as the nubs on a gripper back mat are. These nubs can wear into the flooring of your car over time, though.
Also pay attention to the type of rubber used on the back of the mat. Styrene butadiene rubber is more affordable, but Nitrile butadiene rubber is oil-resistant.

, Even though aesthetics won't impact the effectiveness of your car mats, for many, these details are still valued enough to consider.


Branded mats, designer mats, and sports theme mats all feature logos and designs related to a specific product, brand, team, or other interest.
Colored mats are a simpler way to customize the aesthetics of your car flooring. They tend to be both practical and visually appealing and come in a range of colors that can match or complement the car's interior.

, Use a measuring tape to measure the distance between the door and the center divider in between the driver and passenger side seats.


Only measure the floor space between these two points. Do not measure from the door itself to the wall of the center divider, since this measurement will be slightly larger than the floor space between both points.
The center divider in the front will be your car's center console. The center divider in the back will usually be the floor hump.

, Use a measuring tape to measure the distance between the back of the seat and the front stopping point for each mat.


The front stopping point will be the furthest point your feet are expected to reach while sitting in that seat. If you aren't sure where that point is, it might be a good idea to sit in each seat of the car and slide your feet as far up along the floor as possible.
Note that the length of the front passenger floor mat will be the longest and should cover all flat floor space in front of that seat.
The length of the front driver mat will need to stop just short of the gas and brake pedals.

, Car mats are never perfect rectangles because the space they need to cover is never perfectly rectangular.


The floor mats will only cover the flat portion of the floor. When the floor slants up or when an obstruction covers the floor, you will need to measure the space around that obstruction to determine how the mat should fit around it.
If you need guidance, it may help to look at commercial car mats designed for your vehicle or type of vehicle. The measurement of each slant, indentation, and angle may vary from those you'll need for your car, but these commercial mats should offer some guide. Floor mat diagrams may also help.

, Trace the measured perimeter onto heavy paper. Cut this pattern out with scissors.









You will need a separate car mat pattern for the floor in front of each seat.
These patterns do not need to look neat, but you do need to make sure that the measurements of your pattern perimeter match the measurements you took with your tape measure.

, Place each paper pattern over the appropriate floor space in your car. Add more paper or cut away sections as needed until each pattern covers the precise space it needs to cover.








When removing sections of paper to improve the fit, do so by cutting away small portions at a time. Stop once that side of the paper lies flat against the floor.
If you need to add sections of paper, do so by taping them on. Stop once the paper covers the entire flat surface of the floor without bending into any slants or obstructions.

, If you altered the pattern to improve the fit, make sure that you measure each straight edge and angle. Write these measurements down.









This set of measurements will be what you need to provide to the custom car mat service.
Even if you didn't alter anything, it's still a good idea to measure the perimeter of the pattern again, just to make sure that the measurements of the pattern match the measurements you've recorded.

, Remove any old mats from your car and clean the carpet lying beneath them.









You should be able to lift the old mats straight out. Removing old mats will ensure the best fit for your new ones. It's also safer to install new mats directly on the car floor, rather than installing them on top of old mats.
At minimum, you should vacuum the carpet covering the car floor. If there are stains and heavy soiling, you may need to clean the carpet with water and carpet cleaning shampoo. Make sure that the car floor is dry before continuing.

, Most newly purchased car mats are already fairly clean, but you should brush off any dirt or debris before installing them in your car.









If you are using second-hand mats, you may also need to vacuum carpeted mats or scrub hard-surface mats with soap and water.

, Lay out all of the mats at once and make sure that you know which mat goes in front of which seat in your car.


You'll need to take a few moments to do this regardless of whether you have standard or customized mats.
Spread the mats out where you can see them all at once. A driveway or garage is usually the ideal choice.
The car mats may come labeled, but if not, you will need to figure it out by shape and size. Shorter mats usually go in the back, while longer mats often go in the front.

, Most mats will simply lie directly over the floor in front of the seats. Some will need to be fitted onto factory retention posts, though.








Some cars have factory retention posts, while others don't. These posts are hooks or rods located at the center or around the perimeter of your floor in front of the seat. The number and location of posts will vary depending on your car model.
If the car has factory retention posts and the mats are specific to your car manufacturer and/or model, or if the mats are customized to your specific car, they will usually have corresponding latch spots. Secure these latching spots over the retention posts, snapping them in place.
Make sure that the gripping or non-skid side of the mat faces down as you install it.
Work around the perimeter of each car mat, pressing it down in place until it is flat against your floorboard and feels secure.

, Check the mat placement along the pedals and seat base to make sure that the mats do not block any of these features.


Look at both the gas and brake pedals. Both must move freely without hitting the mats.
Try to adjust the seats back and forth, sliding them along the track rails. You should be able to slide the seats smoothly and without running into the mats.

Locate the engine.,
See how the engine is mounted.,
Look for a differential.",How to Determine if Your Car Is Front  or Rear Wheel Drive," Most cars have the engine at the front; these cars may be either front- or rear-wheel drive. Cars with the engine at the rear, such as the Volkswagen Beetle, are always rear-wheel drive cars.;
, If the engine is transverse-mounted (that is, mounted sideways), with the belts facing one side of the car, your car is most likely a front-wheel drive car. If the engine is mounted longitudinally (front to back), with the belts facing the front grille, your car is most likely a rear-wheel drive car.

, The differential is a large, pumpkin-shaped housing that transfers power from the driveshaft to the wheels. If there is such an assembly on the car's rear axle, the car has a rear-wheel drive. On front-wheel drive cars, the differential is integrated with the transmission in a unit at the rear of the engine called a transaxle, and the wheels are connected to the driveshaft by constant velocity (CV) joints.

Choose a corded detector for the best range detection.,
Pick a cordless detector if you drive two or more cars.,
Opt for a remote-mounted detector to prevent theft.",How to Buy a Radar Detector1," A corded detector can detect all types of radar signals. It's inexpensive and easy to install. Use the suction cups to mount it to the windshield. Then, plug it in to your car's cigarette lighter or charging socket.

On the other hand, this kind of detector is very visible, particularly to thieves and police officers. Additionally, the cord is space-consuming.;
, The cordless detector is easy to install like its corded cousin. Mount it to the windshield using its suction cups. Remove it when you switch cars. Because the cordless detector runs on batteries, it doesn't take up as much space as a corded detector.

As a disadvantage, cordless detectors can be expensive. They also have a poorer range detection because of their battery power. Furthermore, they can't pick up fast-working POP radar signals as effectively as corded detectors can., A remote-mounted radar detector can be installed in hidden or inconspicuous places in your car, such as at the base of the rear-view mirror. This can help to keep it out of the eyeshot of thieves. Some models have radar-jamming capabilities.

On the other hand, remote-mounted detectors are the most expensive types. They also have to be professionally installed, which could cost extra time and money. Finally, if a police officer finds out you're using radar-jamming equipment, you could be charged with a felony."

Choose the name of a beautiful person.,
Name the car after your favorite musician or cartoon character.,
Add a prefix or adjective to the name.,
Search online for other popular car names.,
Use an online name generator.",How to Choose a Nickname for Your Car1," One of the most common ways to name your car is to think of a celebrity or model that you like and give it the same name. Try to make the name something that's uncommon so that people don't get confused when you refer to your car by its name.Some good names include Claire, Stella, Brock, and Venus.;
, If you're looking around for names that aren't commonly used for people, you can name the car after a musician or cartoon that you enjoy. Think of your favorite band or your favorite character in a cartoon and give your car the same name.Car names that are based on musicians or artists include Sid, Beyonce, and Bono.

, Adding a prefix like Ms. or Mr. will add some character to the car name that you choose. If you don't want to lead the name with that sort of prefix, you can choose an adjective that will help describe the car's overall look.

Good adjectives for your name includes colors like white, black, or silver.
Good starting adjectives for your car include things like super, baby, or old.

, If you can't think of an original name, you can get inspired by looking at what other people are naming their cars. Search online for car names and look for lists with different car names. Scan the lists and find one that suits you and your car., If you're totally out of ideas and are unsure of what to name your car, you can take an online quiz or name generator to help you determine which name you should choose. There are also websites specifically dedicated to generating a name for your car."

Choose a model with city mode and highway mode.,
Opt for 360-degree laser detection.,
Look for Spectre or VG-2 protection.,
Go with voice alerts.,
Look for high K-band sensitivity.",How to Buy a Radar Detector2," Use city mode when driving in urban areas. This way, your detector won't be fooled by weaker signals like car alarms. Turn on highway mode for more open spaces, such as highways and country roads. Highway mode is more sensitive and gives you more advanced warning., Laser radar (LIDAR) works more quickly and gets a more accurate reading of your speed than traditional radar does. Radar detectors without laser protection won't detect lasers. Regular laser detection only picks up laser signals ahead of you. Shell out the extra cash for 360-degree protection, which will detect lasers from all angles.On the down side, if you have a heavy lead foot, by the time the laser detection alerts you, the police have already flagged you., Police use Spectre and VG-2 to detect radar detectors. Stealth protection can shut your device down before you get caught. Invisible protection allows the detector to operate without being noticed. Of course, invisible protection will cost you extra.The only disadvantage is that Spectre and VG-2 protection can't tell you whether you've been targeted. They can only let you know if such technology is being used in the area., With older models, you have to look at the display to see what your detector has picked up. Voice alerts allow you to keep your eyes on the road while you receive your alert. This feature is more expensive, but it's less likely to cause an accident., Traditional X-band detectors alert you to radar guns that are already on before the police can catch you. They can't detect Instant-On radar in time for you to slow down. Only a detector with high K-band sensitivity can alert you to this more sophisticated radar."
"
Choose GPS technology to pinpoint cameras.,
Choose auto-mute for hands-free volume control.,
Pick smartphone compatibility to receive crowdsourced alerts.,
Purchase an extended warranty, if necessary.",How to Buy a Radar Detector3," These days, authorities use speed and red-light cameras in many cities and on highways. GPS alerts you to the locations of these cameras. Spend the extra money if you frequently drive in a community with these cameras installed., With traditional models, radar alerts continue to sound until you're out of range of a radar gun. Many models have a mute switch that you have to activate manually. Auto-mute lowers the volume and then shuts it off automatically. Choose this option if radar alerts distract you or if you don't feel comfortable muting the alert while driving., Expensive newer radar detector models allow you to download an app to your smartphone. Enter enforcement regions into the app as you encounter them. Other drivers will do the same to alert you. This allows you to give your detector a break, especially if you're driving in a state that bans radar detectors., Most detectors come with a one-year warranty. In many cases, this is enough. Go for an extended warranty if you live in a high-crime area or a region prone to frequent natural disasters. This is also a good idea if you're accident-prone."
"
Base the name on the shape and size of the car.,
Include the make and model in the name.,
Choose the name based on the type of car you drive.,
Choose a name based on the color.",How to Choose a Nickname for Your Car2," Look at the body of your car. If it's blocky, bulky, or powerful, a more masculine name may lend itself better to the car. If it's sleek, sexy, and mysterious, a feminine name may suit it better. If the car doesn't fit any particular gender stereotypes, you can name it something neutral.For example, feminine car names would include Christine, Carolyn, or Shirley.
Male car names would include The Beast, Charles, and Wolverine.
Gender neutral names include Tequila Sunrise, Lightning, Alex, or Kelsey.

, Certain car models lend themselves to good car names depending on what they are. Determine the kind of car you drive and think of names that can include the model of the car.For instance, if you're driving a Camry, you can name your car Cammie or Cam.
If you're driving a Lexus, you can name your car Alexis or Lexie.

, Think about whether your car is a pickup truck, sports car, or regular sedan and pick a name that sounds like it applies to the type of car that you have. For instance, you wouldn't want to name a slow truck with the name Supercharged or Red Hot, because it doesn't represent the aesthetic of the car., There are a variety of more non-conventional names that you can choose based on the color of your car. Such names include Silver Surfer, Shadow, Black Magic, Marshmallow, and Ladybug. Determine the color of your car and think of names that can relate to the color.

Other names based on color include Nightcrawler, Cherry Bomb, Mr. Freeze, Cookie Monster, Frogger, Mean Green, and Creamsicle."

Write down all your options.,
Ask friends and family what they think about the name.,
Take your time and stick with the name once you've chosen it.",How to Choose a Nickname for Your Car3," Take all of the names that you're considering for your car and write them down on a piece of paper or type them into a word document. Narrow down the names that you don't like by crossing them out. Come back to the list at a later date and continue to narrow down the names until you only have a couple of options left. This should help you come up with the perfect name of your car., Once you've narrowed down your choices or chosen a name, run it by your close family and friends to see what their reaction is. Take their suggestions into consideration. If there is a name that is wildly popular among many of your friends and family, you can assume that the name is a good one., Don't feel rushed to name your car. Instead, take your time and think about the narrowed down choices that you wrote on your list. Once you decide on a name, stick with it. Constantly changing the name of your car will confuse people and defeats the purpose of naming your car in the first place."

See if your place of work provides free charging.,
Install a charger at your house (Note that the point of installation of the charger must be well ventilated, cool and dry).,
Investigate charging options for when you are on the road.",How to Charge Your Electric Car," Ask your employer! If they don't now, they may in the future.;
,


Decide where you want the charger to be at your house. Do you have garage space? Think about what is convenient,safe and least costly (see below.)
Speak to a licensed electrician to get the cost of installing a charging station at your house. The electrician will want the charging specs from your auto manufacturer.
A charging station at your house can be cheap, or expensive, depending on two things:

If you have enough power in your current breaker box. If not enough, you will need to upgrade your box.
If your current electrical service is close to where you will park your car. If you are parking outside, you will need to run the service to that location using exterior rated equipment.


Remember that most electric cars including Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S can be charged with a standard 110v household outlet.

The Chevy Volt will charge to its full 40 (64km) mile electric range in about 11 hours on standard 110v AC. For charging a Volt overnight at your house, that might be enough, saving you the expense of installing 220v.
The Tesla Model S will also charge about 40 miles in 11 hours, but since full charge is much more than that (200 or 250 miles, 321 or 402km), 110v isn't enough for most Tesla owners.
In the UK, the Renault Zoe comes with a free wall charger that British Gas will hook up for you, but you still have to pay for the battery service


There may be different charging cables and boxes for your house, some that charge faster for a higher price. It just depends on how quickly you need a charge. Most people charge overnight, which means you don't need a fast charge at home.

,


Download an app to your smartphone to help you find charging stations.
Your city or area may have free electricity /charging stations.
If you have a Tesla, you may be able to benefit from their free Supercharger network for road trips.
Dealers for your brand of car will often have a plug you can borrow.
You can sign up for a service such as Chargepoint or Plugshare. Chargepoint has a network of charging stations that you can access for a fee.

, Write down the difference between the two odometer readings. If the number was 30,000 miles (48,280 km) when you filled the tank the first time and 30,300 (48,763 km) when you refilled, you drove 300 miles (482.8 km) on 1 tank of gas.

, For example, if you drove 300 miles (482.8 km) and burned 15 gallons (56.78 liters) of gasoline, your vehicle got about 20 miles per gallon (8.5 km per liter).

, (If your car has 30,000 miles and is 40 months old, you drive about 750 miles per month.) In this hypothetical example, divide 750 (1,207 km) by 20 gallons (75.7 liters) to get the number of gallons or liters you burn per month: 37.5 gallons (142 liters).

During most training courses you will learn many skills such as how to handle chemicals, use power like buffers and extractors, communicate with customers, run a business, remove stains and scratches, and remove smoke odors. Training of this type, more than reading, will give you the hands on experience you need to succeed.The International Detailing Association offers a course that uses written testing and hands-on assessments culminating in becoming a Certified Detailer.
Simoniz USA offers online training and certification at their website, http://www.simoniz.com/car-washes/professional-detailing/training-certifications/.

, If you are still completing high school or attending seminars or training is not an option yet, spend your time learning as much as you can on your own. Many websites are devoted specifically to teaching you what tools and products you need to be familiar with to be a good detailer.Even if you think you know enough already, or the job seems obvious, it never hurts to brush up on your knowledge base when it comes to jobs.

, You don’t have to wait until you get a full time detailing job to start getting the hang of doing the job well. If your own car could use a little extra love, this is a great way to start practicing. After you have done a lot of reading on auto detailing websites, try out some of the products and tips that you learned.

, Once you have put in the time making your own care look fresh off the lot, ask some other people if you can give them some free detailing work. You’ll benefit by getting to work on various types of vehicles, and they’ll benefit by having a cleaner car.


Before using any power tools or harsh chemicals, make sure that you are confident in your abilities.

, Becoming a top notch detailer will take time and hard work. One way to take some of the pressure off is to get good at one or two parts of the detailing process at a time. On your first time getting to work in your car, don’t try to get every part of the car perfect because it can get overwhelming. Make yourself proficient at one aspect of the detailing process at a time.


Give yourself a break if you don’t get the wax right the first time, or if keeping windows streak free is a challenge. You’ll gain mastery as you keep working on your skills.

, In the meantime, working at a carwash will offer the quantity of experience that you’ll need to finely tune the skills you are working on. A car wash may be more basic than the type of detailing you’d specialize in with your own business, but it’s a good training ground.

, It’s hard to get much of any job without knowing what a company needs out of their employees. As you begin to search for detailer jobs, take careful note of what requirements the job descriptions list as necessary. Look at postings from a few companies and see what they all have in commonAs you learn what companies want in a detailer, you can work to gain those traits and make sure they are reflected on your resume.

, To be hired by an auto shop or car dealership specifically as a detailer will probably require you to show on paper what you are capable of. Especially if you are able to attend training and gain certifications, a solid resume is a great way to make yourself impressive to hiring managers. You can look at various examples of car detailer resumes to see what are typically included as skills and previous experiences.If you are able to build up your resume over time, by completing high school and specific training, and by showing your car wash experience, employers will see that you have what they need.
If don’t have quite the qualifications that are best, find a way to rework your resume in a way that is similar to what auto detailers want to see. Maybe as a janitor you have worked with cleaning chemicals. Maybe you learned customer service in a retail job. Maybe mowing lawns taught you how to manage your time well. The best resumes take what you have to offer and package them in a way that’s desirable for the job you want.

, It may seem obvious, but the last step toward becoming an auto detailer is to get yourself a job as a detailer. You may have more options than you think. Do not limit your idea of what places might need a detailer. The main ones are auto dealerships, auto mechanic and repair shops, but you may also be able to find another auto detailer with their own company who is looking to expand.


More than just searching for job postings, try calling these places and asking if they have an opening or would consider hiring a detailer. You never know what might come of cold calling a business. They may be willing to hire you even if they weren’t looking for one yet.

, Even as you get a car wash job, or if you eventually start your own detailing business, learning new and better methods is a constant process. Don’t get so set in your ways that you won’t try something new.

Avoid weather effects.,
Replace torn or missing rubber gaskets.,
Wipe down the door frame.,
Coat the rubber with a protective liquid.",How to Keep Car Doors from Freezing Shut1," The typical cause of car doors and car locks freezing shut is ice. When icing conditions are predicted — rain near the freezing point, freezing rain, freezing fog, or rain and snow — get your vehicle under cover. Another possible cause is frigid weather, which may cause locks and car doors to freeze without a lot of moisture causing the problem. Of course, not everyone has access to a covered parking space, heated garage, or the like.

Avoid locking your doors. If possible, keep doors unlocked. This will avoid the locking mechanism from locking into place. However, leaving the doors unlocked may allow the car to be entered by a thief. Do not leave any valuables in the vehicle if you plan on leaving it unlocked.
Place duct tape over your door lock to keep it from freezing.
If your car is parked outside, a car cover or tarp minimizes the amount of moisture from snow and rain that can reach the door parts and freeze.This is especially useful during an ice storm or other icing event.



 

;
, The rubber gasket, or seal, along the edge of the car door is the area that freezes, not the metal itself. Inspect the seal on each car door and around each window. Visit an auto parts store to purchase replacements if you notice tears or gaps where water could seep in.

, Clean the entire door frame to remove road debris and other detritus that can build up over time. Water can collect around the dirt and freeze the door shut once the temperatures drop.

, Rub oil or lubricant over the rubber seals with a paper towel. This will repel water, reducing the amount that enters the seal and freezes. There is some disagreement over which oil is best to use, but here are a few options:


A rubber conditioner or rubber care product are probably the safest options for long-term care.
Silicone spray lubricant can last several weeks per application, but it can damage foam rubber seals and should be kept away from paint.WD40, another light lubricating oil, or even nonstick cooking spray are easily available options, but repeated use can dry out or disintegrate the rubber."

Protect your eyes, ears, and skin.,
Keep comfortable in the cold.,
Keep comfortable in the heat.,
Know when to give up and close the top.",How to Drive a Convertible Top Down Year Round," The more you ride in an open vehicle, the more you'll expose them to wear and tear, so a few precautions are in order.



Eyes: Wind can carry small particles and water around the windshield. Liquids (generally water, fortunately) and objects (generally small, fortunately) can fall from structures overhead. So, protect everyone's eyes with glasses. Particularly the driver's, because momentary distraction or blindness could cause an accident.

Prescription glasses are a good start, so long as they are plastic, not glass.
Wraparound plastic glasses are better. Some sit close to the face for sleek appearance and sealing out wind; others sit further away to accommodate prescription glasses underneath and not brush against eyelashes. Some come with, and most can be equipped with, an elastic band between the ear pieces to keep them handy after brief removal. Polarized sunglasses block direct sunlight and its specular reflections (""glare"") much more than other light: light-colored ones are great for morning, evening, and leaving midday light bright but not too bright. These types are often sold for fishing and are inexpensive.
Snow and ice treatments leave many small particles on the road for winter and spring.



Ears: Wind and traffic can be loud, which means music loud enough to drown them out would be very loud.Slow down. Turbulence, and thus noise, increases disproportionately to speed. 70 MPH (112 km/h) will be much louder than 55 or 60 MPH (88 or 96 km/h).
Reduce turbulence and wind noise. Putting the windows up reduces turbulence within the car interior; even a light covering such as earmuffs or a cap reduces turbulence around the ears a little.
If you listen to the stereo, choose something that is enjoyable even if muffled, and don't turn it up loud enough to drown out the road noise entirely. Try country, pop, rock, news, or talk, not classical. Turning up the treble may make it more understandable at a given volume setting.
You could try hearing-protection equipment such as earplugs, but make sure you can hear the ambient environment, just not as loudly. If you use them, leave the stereo off lest you make it unbearably loud for others in the vicinity.


Skin. The main risk is sunburn. The sun shines just about as brightly when it's cold as when it's hot, and much of its damaging ultraviolet radiation can penetrate haze and clouds. You might also get dry skin or chapped lips but those are rarely serious, difficult to treat, or a long-term danger.

Keep sunscreen in the car for everyone to apply before a long trip, or even a shorter trip if prone to sunburn.
Choose a variety that does not irritate the eyes. Sweat, wind, and rubbing around eyes after not washing hands will inevitably get a little sunscreen in them.
Apply it most carefully to whatever exposed skin faces upward: bald head, bald spot, part line, forehead, nose, upper cheeks, ears, collar area, shoulders, chest, forearms and thighs.

;
, It can be done as follows:


Insulate your torso and cover extremities. Protection from wind is more important and comfortable than bulky insulation. A little ventilation is nice, though.


Jacket. A nylon windbreaker or leather jacket is a good start.
Earmuffs. The behind-the-head kind is arguably more stylish, or at least less noticeable.

Gloves. Check dexterity and grip. Dense synthetic fleece may provide these satisfactorily, and is washable.


Use the heater. It uses only a part of the car's waste heat, so it's free. Set it to blow toward the footwells, from which air circulates out less rapidly, as well as the upper body. More heat can be used if it is not directed straight at the driver's bare knuckles.
Reduce drafts. Put up the windows, the rear screen (if the car has one), and/or block the gap between headrests with a clear plastic shield (may interfere with reclining) or elastic cover that goes over both (confirm adequate rear visibility).
Use heated seats, air deflectors, neck ducts, a heated steering wheel, and other special features if you have them.

If you use an aftermarket electrical heating device, make sure it can't run down the battery, or at least that you have a jump starter box (with its own battery) to use if you do happen to exhaust the battery.


Use a personal air duct. These are commercially available under the brand ""CoolCop"".You attach its cup over a dashboard air vent, close the other vents, and it blows the air through a vacuum cleaner hose and through a soft, flexible vinyl U-shaped nozzle down your collar. Your body will distribute the heat.

This item is extremely effective, though probably not practical for more than the driver and front passenger (using the two center vents, which typically have the most direct air paths). You may not need to put the windows up. Protecting extremities from the cold would still be wise.
Attach the dash cup to the car carefully and be gentle with it once it is attached so as not to damage the vent. They were developed for Crown Victorias, tough full-size sedans.
You may need extra foam rubber to eliminate gaps between the dash cup and dash.
Support the nozzle comfortably near your collar by hanging it over the seat belt.
Distribute the heat well while avoiding overheating by turning the fan up most of the way, and turning down the temperature.
Don't use a personal air duct if you have poor circulation or temperature regulation (you could burn yourself, overheat your core, or fail to heat your extremities) or a manual transmission (the hose could interfere with shifting). Consider its use carefully if you are particularly small (an airbag would hit it and you harder).


Avoid frostbite and hypothermia. If a body part becomes painful or numb or you feel chilled or oddly tired overall, put the top down and warm up. Do not drive with the top down in cold weather with passengers particularly vulnerable to chilling or likely not to complain about warning signs, such as anyone sleeping, very old or very young (who shouldn't be in a convertible with the top down anyway because they might not fully understand the need to stay inside).

, It's easy for a short time in moderate heat: put down the top and drive! For higher heat and longer periods:


Drink plenty of water. Cool, cold, or even warm, as you prefer: water absorbs much more heat by evaporating as sweat than by simply warming up inside the body.
Wear light-colored, loose-fitting, breathable clothing.
Some cars may have very powerful air conditioning that can keep the interior area cool with the windows up but the top down in hot weather.
Use a personal air duct such as a CoolCop, ideally with a light but long-sleeved shirt to hold in the cold air. It probably won't be as surprisingly effective for cooling as heating, because cars throw off huge amounts of heat but have to work to make limited amounts of cold.

Avoid heat stress. Avoid driving with the top down in temperatures well over 90ºF/32.2ºC except, possibly, with exceptionally powerful air conditioning or a ventilation duct (for everyone). The temperature near a road will be higher, and the hot wind can quickly dehydrate and overheat you. Do not drive with the top down in very hot weather with anyone sleeping, very old, or very young.

,



Rain or snow. A convertible interior is generally as vulnerable to water as a regular car's. The top generally can't be closed when the car is in motion–the wind would rip it off–so, when rain threatens, give yourself plenty of time to stop in a safe place and close it.

Fatigue. The wind and noise make driving with the top down more tiring.

Crime. Close up the car before going through a questionable area, particularly after dark or where stopping might be likely.

Remove the filter.,
Determine whether your filter needs cleaning.,
Shake off loose dust and dirt.,
Spray the filter with cleaning solution.,
Allow the solution to soak on the filter for 10 minutes.,
Rinse the filter from the inside out with cool water.,
Shake off the excess water.,
Let the filter air dry overnight.,
Apply a thin coat of oil to each fold in the filter.,
Let the oil stand for 20 minutes.,
Replace the air filter.",How to Clean a K&N Air Filter," Pop the hood on your vehicle to access the engine compartment. Find your air filter—these are almost always housed inside a large plastic box that makes them easily identifiable. If there are ring clamps or latches holding the filter in place, disengage them and lift the filter straight out.Depending on the make and model of your vehicle, the air filter may be flat, circular or conical in shape. The methods used to clean the filter will be the same regardless of its design.You may also want to stick a towel or some other object into the air intake port to keep debris from entering the engine after the filter has been removed.;
, K&N advises that their air filters only require service if any of the filter’s folds are covered so thickly with dust or dirt that they’re no longer visible. If you can still plainly see the pleats on your filter, it may not need to be cleaned, even if it appears dirty.If your filter looks clogged or fuzzy, or if it's lost all traces of its reddish oil coat, it’s probably due for a cleaning.

, Give the filter a gentle shake to dislodge whatever debris is resting on the surface. Don eye protection and a breathing mask if you have them to avoid inhaling dust particles. Be careful not to shake the filter too hard or handle the pleats directly, as this could potentially damage them.You can also use a soft-bristled brush to remove dust without harming the filter.
To avoid making a mess, it’s recommended that you remove your air filter outside.

, Grab the bottle of aerosol cleaner that came included with your filter. Spray the filter liberally on both sides. It’s important that you clean both the inner and outer surfaces of the filter, not just the dirty exterior pleats. Make sure each individual pleat has been thoroughly misted with cleaner.Use as much solution as you need to completely coat both sides of the filter.
K&N's proprietary air filter cleaning solution can be purchased online or wherever auto accessories are sold.

, As the cleaner sits on the filter, it will begin to cut through caked-on grime, making it easy to rinse away. Place the filter in the sink or on a towel while the cleaning solution does its job. This will prevent dissolved gunk from running off and staining your work surface.Be careful not to let the cleaning solution dry on the filter.

, Turn on a hose or tap to a light stream. Hold the air filter directly under the stream so that the water runs through the inside of the filter to the outside. The water will carry away the dust and dirt loosened by the cleaning solution.Rinsing from the outside in will just force dirt further into the filter.If your air filter happens to be especially filthy, you may need to repeat the cleaning and rinsing process more than once in order to restore it to a like-new condition.

, Alternatively, you can rest the filter against another object at an angle and let it drip-dry. Get off as much standing moisture as you can. Again, try not to handle the filter too roughly.Set the filter on a clean, dry towel to absorb more water.
For quicker drying, make sure you leave the filter in a well-ventilated area at a mild temperature., It will usually take somewhere between six and eight hours for the filter to dry completely indoors. Plan on servicing your air filter at a time that you know you won’t need to drive anywhere.Do not attempt to apply oil while the filter is still wet.If need be, you can temporarily install a regular disposable air filter so that you'll be able to use your vehicle while your K&N filter finishes drying.

, Your K&N air filter Recharger kit should also include a separate oil in either a squeeze bottle or aerosolized spray can. This oil needs to be spread directly over each pleat in the filter. If you’re using a squeeze bottle, run the tip along the top of the pleat as you squeeze. If you’re using a spray can, hold the filter a few inches away from the nozzle to ensure that the oil coats properly.K&N air filter oil contains a subtle red dye that makes it easy to see how much of the filter you’ve covered. By the time you’re finished, the entire filter should have a reddish tint to it.
Use a paper towel to wipe away excess oil around the edges of the filter and work the oil more evenly into the pleats.Be sure to work outside or in another well-ventilated area and spray the oil away from your face.

, The oil will wick into the surface of the filter, creating a more effective barrier.Oil is used to help the filter collect dust, dirt and other debris as it enters the air intake.
The oil also serves to protect the filter from deterioration, extending its lifespan.

, Slide the filter back into its specified slot in the engine compartment. Remember to reattach any clips or clamps that secure it. Your car’s engine will now be protected, optimized and ready for up to another 50,000 miles of open road!Even though K&N air filters are designed to last, you should still get in the habit of checking the condition of your filter every 25,000 miles.If you placed a stopper in your air intake, don’t forget to remove it before reinstalling your filter.

Rub the key and lock with rubbing alcohol.,
Spray a lock lubricant for severe problems.,
Spray frozen locks with a de-icer.,
Heat the key.,
Warm the lock with a hairdryer or your own breath.",How to Keep Car Doors from Freezing Shut2," Choose a rubbing alcohol that contains at least 60% alcohol, so the alcohol will adhere to the lock and prevent moisture from freezing over it. Rub it onto the key and the door lock with a paper towel once per week to prevent ice from forming. This can also work to melt existing ice, but is typically slower than the methods below.Petroleum jelly is another option, but may leave a messy residue on your equipment.

, If rubbing alcohol is not enough to keep your lock usable, select a lock lubricant. Even experts tend to have differing opinions about lubricant choices, but some options are recommended more often than others. Use only one of the following options per lock, since a mix could easily gum it up:A graphite lubricant typically comes in a squeeze bottle of air that can be pressed directly into the keyhole. Some people find this can absorb moisture over time and leave gunk on the key.
Teflon-based lubricant is often recommended, but some people consider the products that contain silicone messy and ineffective.
Greaseless lubricants are supposed to attract less dust and debris.

, Keep a de-icer product in your garage or winter jacket, in case you are frozen out of your car. These are typically sprayed directly onto the lock, and are the most effective option in severe ice conditions. Choose the lock with the least amount of ice buildup, spray, and insert the key., Hold the key with an oven mitt or tongs, with the toothed tip over a lighter or match, then insert it in the lock. If the key is completely metal, with no plastic handle or computerized fob, you can safely heat the key while it is inserted in the lock.This is not common a practice in cold climates; and there are other, safer alternatives for you and your vehicle. This should only be attempted if no other alternatives are available.
Do not do this with a key with a computerized chip. This may easily damage the electronics, and replacements can costs hundreds of dollars.

, This method is less effective, but worth a try if no other options are available. A cardboard tube (such as an empty toilet paper tube) placed over the frozen lock will help direct the warm air.Keep trying for several minutes, especially if you do not have a tube or if conditions are windy.


If your car is outside, use a battery-operated hair dryer, or an extension cord rated for outdoor use.

Bring the vehicle in for repairs if necessary.",How to Fix Your Car's Air Conditioner," Use the key to start the car and turn the air conditioner on high. Feel the air coming out of the air conditioner and assess how warm, cool, or cold it is. If the air is warm to cool, but not cold as it should be, there may be an issue with air flow.Check to see if the cooling fans on your radiator are running. If they are not, there may be an electrical issue.
You may need to replace the cabin air filter in your vehicle to increase air flow.;
, You will need to ensure the air conditioner compressor is working to determine the correct course of action to make repairs if necessary. Locate the air conditioner in the engine bay and look to see if the center of the pulley is turning along with the pulley itself.There is a clutch that engages when the air conditioner is working. With the clutch engaged, the middle of the pulley will rotate along with the pulley itself.
If the clutch does not engage, the A/C compressor may be broken and require replacement or it may just need to be filled with refrigerant.

, Most compressors have a wire leading to the electric clutch. Find the connector in the middle of that wire, and unplug it. Take a length of wire and run it from the compressor's wire to the positive (+) terminal of your battery. If you hear a loud CLACK, the electric clutch is functioning properly. If not, it will need to be replaced.Replacing your A/C compressor may require specialized tools.
Bring your vehicle in for repairs if the compressor or clutch needs to be replaced.

, You can purchase leak detection kits to help you identify any leaks in your air conditioning system. These kits provide a dye that will run through the lines and seep out of any leaks or cracks, making them visible to the naked eye.Connect the leak detection can to the low side service port and spray it into the air conditioning system.
If you spot any leaks, you will need to take the vehicle in for repairs.
If you do not spot any leaks, the problem may simply be low refrigerant.

, The easiest way to determine the correct type of refrigerant for your vehicle is to check the year it was made. All vehicles built after 1995 use R134a. If your vehicle is older than that, it likely used R12.You cannot refill R12 refrigerant on your own.
If your vehicle uses R12, you should schedule an appointment with an auto repair specialist to convert it.

, In order to read the gauge on the refrigerant, you need to know the current temperature in your environment. Refrigerant occupies a different amount of space within the can and air conditioning system at different temperatures, causing the gauge to read differently at different times.Knowing the ambient temperature will allow you to effectively read the gauge on the refrigerant can.
When refrigerant expands to take up more space, it increases the pressure in the can.

, Your air conditioning system will have two service ports: a low side and a high side port. When recharging your air conditioner, you will need to locate and identify the low side service port.You can find the low side service port by following the lines from the A/C compressor until you find a nozzle near the bottom of the car.
Refer to your vehicle’s service manual to help you locate the port if you are unable to.

, Make sure you don’t clog the service port with any grime or debris by wiping off the port, cap and area around it with a rag. Wipe the cap and the line first, then remove the cap and wipe off the port itself.You can spray brake cleaner onto the line to help you clean it if need be.

, Take the hose that comes with the refrigerant refill kit and connect it to the low side service port you identified earlier. Make sure the opposite end of the hose is connected to the nozzle on the can.If your can came with a gauge, the hose should be connected to the nozzle on the gauge and then to the can.
The hose should be long enough to allow you to connect it to the port without placing the can all the way into the engine bay.

, Read the gauge display while taking the ambient temperature into account to determine what level the refrigerant is currently at. Once you begin spraying, you will need to keep an eye on the gauge to determine when the system is full.Keep an eye on the gauge throughout recharging the system to know when to stop.
Read the instructions on the can if you are unsure of how to read the gauge.

, Turn the valve on the top of the refrigerant can clockwise until it pierces the top and begins releasing refrigerant through the hose and into the vehicle’s air conditioning system.Some cans may require a different method to break their seal. Refer to the instructions on the can for guidance if need be.

, As you allow the refrigerant to pass through into the vehicle’s engine, keep the can upright and shake it occasionally. If you turn the can to the side, the pressure will drop and the can will fail to refill the system.Shaking the can occasionally will help maintain pressure as it continues to force refrigerant into the system.
Do not turn the can or hold it upside down.

, Keep your eye out for signs of leaking in the air conditioning system as you refill it. If you spot a leak, it will need to be repaired by a professional mechanic. Make a note of where the leak was to make it easier to find and address.Leaks should be fairly easy to spot as you refill the system.

, Once the gauge reads as full, remove the hose from the service port and return the cap. If there is refrigerant left in the can, you can keep it to recharge another vehicle or to service the same vehicle again in the future.If the can is empty, you can throw it away.
Be sure the can is not leaking if you opt to store it.

, If you spotted a leak or the air conditioning compressor fails to engage, you will need to bring the vehicle in for repairs. Replacing an A/C compressor may require specialized tools in your application, so it is often beyond the scope of most hobby mechanics.Be careful dealing with refrigerant leaks as the temperatures can be cold enough to injure you.

Read the car's manual and schedule maintenance accordingly.,
Drive less.,
Check the fluids: You should check the level of your antifreeze, oil, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and brake fluid, very regularly.,
Change the oil regularly.,
Change the air filter.,
Flush these fluids every two years: power steering fluid, brake fluid, and cooling system anti-freeze.,
Monitor your brake pad thickness and don't let the pads wear down to metal.,
Rotate the tires.,
Keep the tires inflated.,
Keep the front end aligned.,
Get your car off to a good start every time you drive it.,
Use your parking brake.,
Wash your car: Road salt, sludge and pollution can lead to costly body work.",How to Extend the Life of Your Car," Keeping up with your car's recommended maintenance schedule can help avoid costly problems with your cooling system, drive train, suspension and other components; following the recommended schedule also helps ensure you the get the full benefit of the manufacturer's warranty.;
, Especially, avoid short trips. Cold starts are hard on engines, your gas mileage, and the environment. Short trips can also significantly shorten the life of your muffler. Basically, you get condensation in the exhaust when you start a cold engine, and if you don't run the car for long enough to evaporate all of the condensation out of the system, excessive amounts of water can accumulate in your muffler, and rust a hole through it. Avoid starting a cold car just to pull it into the garage, for instance. Consider walking to the nearest store for a change. Combine short errands, and, if you have multiple vehicles, drive the one more recently driven when you go out again. Do drive a car at least every week or so, since cars that sit for longer than a week or two at a time have other problems, such as fluids gradually draining out of systems. Consult a mechanic if you will store a car for an extended period.

, A good time to do so is when you fill up with gasoline/petrol. Even if your car doesn't leak fluids at the moment, one can occur at any time and you can identify it by checking the fluid levels often. You should also check the color of some of these fluids. Some of these have see-through plastic tanks that you can look through, and some have dipsticks. Antifreeze should be either pink, green, or yellow (Pink for newer cars with ""Dex-Cool"", green for old cars with plain Ethyl-Glycol, and green or yellow for cars that have been flushed and filled with universal antifreeze...brown antifreeze should always be flushed, it either has rust or a lot of dirt in it, probably both. Also, never mix different kinds of antifreeze; if you don't know what color antifreeze your car has, buy a universal brand. Oil will normally be slightly clear (when new) to brown. Oil that looks white and milkshake-like may be contaminated with antifreeze/coolant or very rarely, just a large amount of condensation. You should take your vehicle in for service soon if this is the case. Transmission fluid should be bright red, and should not smell burnt. If it looks or smells burnt, have your transmission fluid flushed. Letting it get too bad can damage your transmission. There's also a chance that you may have an internal transmission problem, especially if you are having problems with shifting or engaging in gears.

, This will improve your gas mileage and protect your engine. The recommended mileage between oil changes is 3,000 - 5,000 miles (or 5000 - 8000 kilometres) or every 3 to 6 months, depending on the type of oil you use and your driving conditions. Doing this could make it possible for your vehicle to attain 200,000 miles (or about 320,000 kilometres). Change the oil filter at the same time; there is no sense in putting clean oil through a dirty filter, and filters are very cheap and available at any auto parts store. If you're unsure how often to change your oil, check your car's owner's manual or contact the dealer for your car's make. In general, conventional oil and harsh driving conditions (like short trips, taxi/police/delivery use, extreme weather, heavy loads) will require more frequent oil changes than fully synthetic oils and light driving conditions.

, This is something you can do easily at home with few or no tools. A screwdriver may be required. You can buy a matching filter at nearly any auto parts store and your owner's manual will show you where your air filter is located. A dirty, dusty filter can slightly hamper gas mileage and make your car accelerate poorly.

, Check this timetable against your owner's manual. Newer cars generally allow longer intervals between changes. Change transmission fluid & filter at least every 50,000 miles (40k to 45k is even better). Older fluids don't lubricate and cool parts as well as fresh fluid and may leave your car unprotected in severe conditions (for example, old antifreeze may not perform well in a very cold winter).

, This will cause damage to your brake rotors (""discs"") at least and possibly your calipers as well. Rotors and calipers are much more expensive to replace than pads. There is no such thing as ""cleaning"" a brake pad while it is still on a car - the friction between the pad and rotor will eradicate any outside substance almost immediately.

, Changing tire position is very important and reduces uneven wear and tear on the tread, thus extending the life of the tires. The recommended rotation cycle is twice a year or every 6,000 - 7,500 miles. Rotate them diagonally - front right to rear left and front left to rear right. However, this pattern can change depending on the drivetrain of the vehicle, and the type of tire. Your vehicle manual will contain detailed rotation information. Keep in mind some tires (especially on sports cars) are directional and are meant to spin only one way. They will have a large arrow on the sidewall to indicate this.

, Under-inflated tires can reduce the tire life by 15% and will slightly decrease your gas mileage, perhaps by 10%. Inflating tires is perhaps the easiest of all activities, and many stores sell tire gauges for a very small cost. Checking your tire pressure every other time you get gas will reduce tire wear and prevent these issues. Monitor your tire tread with a penny. Insert the penny into the tread with Lincoln's head down. If the top of his head is not obscured by the tread, your tires need to be replaced. Basically, if you can see all of Lincoln's head, you must replace your tires.

, If you notice your car shaking while driving at high speeds (not while braking - shuddering while braking indicates warped rotors), or if your tread is wearing unevenly, then you may need an alignment. This is also key to extending the life of your tires and will keep the tread even for increased safety.

, Start the car and drive off slowly and gently until the car reaches operating temperature (known as closed loop). This reduces the strain on the engine while the oil is still cold and thicker. Another option is to use electric engine space heaters, and start the drive with a warm engine. Accelerate promptly to the target speed. For most modern cars, idling a cold engine is both counterproductive and wasteful. Additionally, as you accelerate, release the gas a bit to cause the automatic transmission to upshift while you are not pressing hard on the gas. This causes less wear on the internal clutches. It is easier on the clutches for the car to shift when you ease up on the gas.

, Even if you are driving a car with an automatic transmission, use your parking brake regularly, especially if you're parked on an incline. It helps keep the brakes adjusted in the rear of the car and makes them last longer. Do not use your parking brake in the wintertime because your brake will freeze and it will be stuck until it thaws out.

, Without regular cleaning, you can start to notice rust on the bottom of your doors within four years. Another three to four years and the corrosion will creep to underbody components, like brake lines. It can cost thousands in rust-related repairs if you neglect to wash your car, especially near ocean/gulf shorelines where the road sand or morning dew might be salty.

Check the filter regularly to keep your car breathing at maximum efficiency by keeping the dust out.

,
Change the filter every 50,000 km (30,000 miles), or about once a year.",How to Change Your Air Filter," If you need assistance finding the correct filter, an auto parts store or its website can help you identify the correct filter that fits your vehicle's airbox. Try to get the stock filter that comes with your vehicle to get the most engine life and fuel efficiency out of your vehicle.;
, Park the car on level ground and apply the parking brake. Shift into first gear (manual transmission) or Park (automatic transmission), and turn off the ignition.

, Release the bonnet with the lever inside the car. Move the exterior bonnet catch for final release. Lift the bonnet and secure it with the prop rod (if necessary).

, The air box housing is usually situated near the engine along a duct that travels from the front of the car.


On older cars with carburetors the filter is usually under a bulky, round cover made of plastic or metal.
Newer, fuel-injected cars tend to have a square or rectangular air filter housing can be found slightly off centre between the front grill and the engine.

, Loosen the hose clamp that seals the air conduct. Undo all the screws holding the air filter cover. Some models have wing nuts; other air filters are just clamped on with a quick release system. Keep screws and other parts together and in a safe location so you can find them later. Pull the cover out of the air conduit and lift it up so it comes off the lower part of the housing. Consult a mechanic if you don't know how to lift the cover.

, Now you can see a round or rectangular filter made of cotton, paper or gauze. Filters have a rubber rim that seals off the unit's interior. Simply lift the filter out of the housing.

Seal the air conduit with removable adhesive tape. It only takes a minute and that way you won't get any dirt into the engine whilst cleaning.

, Replace the old filter with a new one. Simply insert it into the housing with the rubber rim facing up. Make sure the edges are sealed by the rubber rim.

, Carefully insert the cover back into the air conduit and then press the entire piece down onto the lower half of the air filter unit.


Make sure it's on straight and securely; otherwise you could alter engine performance. Tighten all the screws or clamps and recheck that you have put everything firmly back together by rocking the unit gently with both hands. Shut the bonnet securely.

,, If you drive in a dusty area, it will need replacement more often. Your owner's manual or periodic maintenance guide should have recommendations for your car.

Decide if a tow bar is your best option.,
Consult the owner's manual for both of vehicles.,
Choose a tow bar design.,
Purchase a tow mounting bracket.,
Check your braking system.,
Ensure that you have all the necessary safety equipment.,
Find a good mounting area.,
Prepare your vehicle for drilling.,
Drill out the holes for the tow bar.,
Secure the brackets to your car.,
Install your pivot brackets.,
Wire your tow bar.,
Attach your safety chains between your car and towing vehicle.",How to Fit a Tow Bar to Your Car," For some RV owners, the tow bar works best, but you can also choose to tow your vehicle using a tow dolly.While a tow dolly props your vehicle on two wheels, the tow bar will pull your vehicle on all four wheels.


If your vehicle can be towed with all four wheels down, then the tow bar will be your best option. Attaching your tow bar often requires modifications to your car, however, so you can't attach a tow bar to a vehicle under warranty.
Pulling the tongue of your tow dolly up will require some strength, so physically limited owners may want to choose a tow bar.
A tow bar is easier to stow and disassemble than a tow dolly, so if you're planning on attaching and detaching often, you'll want to choose a tow bar.
The overall cost of both towing methods is fairly equivalent, so it really comes down to your preference and needs as an RV owner.;
, Before you go about the trouble of attaching a tow bar, you'll want to ensure that your intended towing vehicle can actually transport your other load. Depending on what your towing vehicle is, that vehicle will have a different weight limit, and it's important that you're well aware exactly how much weight your larger vehicle can hold.If you can't find your owner's manual for whatever reason, you can also resort to your compliance certification label, which is found somewhere near the driver's door, generally. If you cannot find this label, try checking near your door sill. It should be visible when you open your vehicle's front door.
In certain cases, your towing vehicle may have to be ""broken in"" before you are able to tow certain loads. This basically means that you'll have to drive a certain number of miles in the car before its transmission is able to hold the load that you're intending on pulling.
The owner's manual for your car will show the weight of that particular model, which should be lower than your towing vehicle's weight limit. If you can't find that owner's manual, you can research your car's weight online.

, When choosing a tow bar design, you'll be looking for either a motorhome-mounted tow bar or a car-mounted tow bar.The motorhome-mounted bar will be inserted into the receiving end of the motorhome hitch receiver. These are preferred, because you won't need to detach them from the front of your towed vehicle.


You can also store them on the back of your towed vehicle when the bar isn't in use. If you choose to use a car-mounted tow bar, then you'll have to keep it stored on the front of your towed vehicle. You can more easily detach these when not in use.

, Regardless of the tow-bar that you choose, you need to attach a mounting bracket before you attach the bar.The mounting bracket, sometimes called a base plate, is used to attach the tow bar to the towed vehicle.


You want to make sure that your mounting bracket will fit specifically to your make of car, as well as the vehicle that you are towing. The base plate will be attached to the back of your car - ranging from the frame, subframe or core support - or somewhere on the undercarriage of the vehicle.

, Because you're carrying an extra load on your towing vehicle, you need to make sure that your braking system won't give out on you. It's more than likely that you'll have to invest in some sort of supplemental braking system.


The inertia of your towed vehicle may be too much for the brakes of your car or truck to handle.Most states in the US require you to add a separate braking system if you're carrying a weight larger than 1,500 pounds.
There are two different types of secondary braking systems. Electronic brakes are attached to a controller in your tow vehicle, while surge brakes are independent systems that are activated by momentum. Be careful that surge brakes are legal within the jurisdiction of your state, as it may vary depending on where you're living.

, Before you start to tow anything, you'll want to have safety cables on hand.These cables will be tethered between your two vehicles, serving as a catch if anything goes wrong in the attaching of your tow bar. This means that if anything goes awry, and your cargo becomes detached from your towing vehicle, the safety cables will catch it.


It's also important that you have all your lights working properly. Regardless of how short your trip may be, you need to make sure that your cargo will be seen by cars driving behind you. Failure to properly light your vehicles could cause a wide variety of dangerous incidents to occur.

, This should be on some sturdy location on your front bumper, as that's where the tow bar will be attaching to the back of your towing vehicle. Make sure that your tow bar will sit properly on your front bumper. This means that you'll want to put the tow bar up against the bumper and see that it fits comfortably.


You also want to test that there's enough room, on the width of the bumper, to drill your holes to attach the bar. This may require the help of a friend. You'll want to make sure the tow bar is perfectly parallel. It's best if you have a second pair of hands to hold the other side.You may have to remove the interior boot trim of your vehicle or your side panels.
Make sure that you're attaching it directly to your bumper. Any free-hanging paneling that protects the front end of your car will be in the way of your strongest mounting point.

, Putting holes in your car can be dangerous, and you also may cause costly damage to your vehicle if you aren't careful.Before picking up any tool, make sure you know exactly what you'll be doing with it. You don't want to accidentally drill into your radiator or cause any electrical damage.


Create a one-inch cross of tape at your place of drilling. This will prevent the drill from sliding off your intended entry point.
Use a hammer and a sharp centre punch to create a light indentation in your bumper. Your drill bit will rest on this point when it enters your vehicle.
If you have no experience drilling metal, or if you feel nervous that you will damage your car, you can seek assistance in attaching your tow bar. While you may have to pay someone to help you with this drilling, you don't want to make a mistake and make costly damage to your vehicle.

, You'll be threading the bolts through the holes of the tow bar and into the chassis of the vehicle. For those maybe unfamiliar with the term, the chassis of a car refers to its frame.In this case, the chassis relates to the undercarriage of the front bumper of the car.


Start by drilling a hole smaller than your bolt by attaching a smaller drill bit. If you're attempting to make a 3/8 inch hole, start with a 1/3 inch drill bit, and then expand the hole with 3/16 inch bit. After that, you can drill with the proper 3/8 bit.
Make sure that you still have a person holding the other end of the tow bar, as drilling your holes in straight is unbelievably important. You'll want to get a drill the corresponds directly to the bolt width of your tow bar brackets.
This information should be found in the manual that came with your tow bar package. If you can't find this, you can measure the width using a small ruler.

, Now that you've drilled the accurately sized holes into your bumper, you need to slide the bolts into the chassis of your vehicle.The bolt size will vary depending on the size of your tow bar and your vehicle. The size of the bolts, however, should align with the size of your bracket holes, as well as the holes that you've drilled into the bumper.


Make sure that you're threading the bolts through both the tow bar bracket and the bumper of the vehicle. You can't slide the bracket onto the bolts. You'll also want to further secure the bolts with a washer and nut set that corresponds to the size of your bracket.Tighten them quickly using a socket wrench.

, After you've secured the tow bar to the front bumper of your vehicle, you'll need to attach the pivot brackets. These brackets will reach from your tow bar to your towing vehicle. Your bracket will vary slightly depending on the sort of tow bar that you've chosen, but the process of securing will be the same.Some brackets will be adjustable, for example, while others may be rigid A-Frame structures that are attached to the bar itself. You'll find a separate pair of nut and bolt hardware in your kit which should be slightly larger than the hardware you used for the bar itself. Insert the pivot brackets into the two ends of your tow bar and tighten.
If you have a pivot bracket with adjustable arms, make sure that you do not tighten the bolts completely. This bracket is meant to move slightly. You do, however, want to check the bolts before attaching your vehicle, as you don't want them to run coming undone. It is a balance of not over-tightening while also ensuring that you don't let the pivot bracket become loose.

, Before attaching your car to your towing vehicle, you need to wire the tow bar to ensure that your braking lights will flow between both electrical systems of your vehicles. Ensuring that your brake and turn signal lights work in tandem for both vehicles is necessary for the safety of those on the road with you.


The two main electrical systems used for towing are the 12N and 12S systems.The 12N is best for standard vehicles, while the 12S is best for caravans and motor homes. Attach the systems between your car and towing vehicle using the color coordinated pins on your wiring sockets, each of which correspond to a different light in your two vehicles.
Depending on how often you plan on towing your car, you can also choose to use removable tail lights, which don't actually connect the electrical systems of your two cars.Removable tail lights are the least invasive and easiest to remove from your RV.
They sit at the back of your towed car, and the wiring wraps underneath the towed car and attaches to the electrical system of your towing vehicle. If you plan on towing often, however, these may not be the most viable option.

, In any towing situation, you need to use safety chains. It's illegal to tow a vehicle without your safety chains.Simply attaching your car to your towing vehicle using the tow bar and pivot brackets won't cut it.


There should be two sets of safety cables that you're using. The long set of cables will attach the RV hitch to the base plate arms of your pivot bracket. You'll then attach the short set of cables between the base plate arms into the frame mount of the tow bar itself.
This will ensure that in the case of any unhitching on the tow bar itself, your car will not careen into traffic. It's doubly important to take this step if it's your first time attaching a tow bar, as mistakes can happen.
Some states actually require two sets of safety chains, so check your state's safety chain laws to see if you'll have to attach a second set of cables.

Purchase an emergency kit or related items.,
Get the right tools.,
Find other maintenance items.,
Locate other visibility items as necessary.,
Evaluate your need for accessories.",How to Buy the Basics for Your Car," This is something that car insurance companies, as well as prime auto businesses like Edmund's and Consumer Reports, all suggest for new car owners. Get all the items and equipment you would need to deal with a roadside emergency and make such situations less dangerous and inconvenient.


Get maintenance-related emergency kit items like jumper cables and extra oil and coolant.
Purchase other types of emergency kit items to help you with specific roadside incidents. Many of the pros recommend a set of flares for visibility on the road, as well as a flashlight to be able to inspect vehicles and other items in the dark, and a blanket to help you stay warm if your auto's heating system fails in an extremely cold environment.;
, Many experts recommend purchasing a comprehensive set of tools for dealing with car-related situations.


Find the right wrench set. Each specific vehicle has its own sizes of bolts and other hardware. You'll need to figure out what sizes you would use for items like battery posts and terminals, and get the right wrenches to match. You'll also want to make sure that there is a proper wrench for lug nuts, for changing or rotating tires.
In addition to the tire wrench or iron, make sure you have an appropriate jack for raising the vehicle for routine maintenance or other incidents.

, One popular tool is a windshield scraper for maintaining visibility when ice accumulates on the windshield or windows of the vehicle.

, Besides the tools and equipment mentioned above, there are a few different types of simple screens and visors that some car owners like to purchase, including back window screens, extra fold downs on mirrors or other sunshade equipment.

, Some basic accessories can also help with vehicle maintenance or convenience for drivers and passengers.


Look at storage capacity for your vehicle. From CD books for vehicles with a disc player, to extra cup holders or bungee cords for holding large items safely, you may want to invest in storage-related accessories for your vehicle. Such items can help protect and maintain the interior of your car.
Consider buying a car cover. If you don't have a garage and want to protect the paint job on your vehicle, a car cover can do the trick. Buy one of these heavy-duty covers and install it on your vehicle when you're not using it to prolong the life of your investment.

Choose a car rack that's compatible with your type of vehicle.,
Select a car rack that will accommodate the equipment you want to transport.,
Decide whether you want the flexibility of removing the rack and attaching it to another vehicle.,
Consider the pros and cons of each type of car rack.",How to Choose a Car Rack or Carrier1," Most car racks have mounting requirements. For example, hitch rack requires a trailer hitch, a spare tire rack only attaches to SUVs with a spare tire mounted on the rear of the vehicle and a trunk rack may not work with cars with a spoiler.;
, Trunk racks, hitch racks and spare-tire racks transport bikes, but the number of bikes vary depending on the type of rack and model. A roof rack is more versatile, giving you the option of transporting skis and snowboards, a kayak, a surfboard, a cargo container and even a Christmas tree.

, Trunk racks are lightweight and portable, while hitch racks are easy to attach and remove. Spare-tire racks and roof racks are often installed permanently.

,


In addition to being versatile, roof racks offer more stability for transporting bikes. Bikes on other types of car racks are likely to sway against each other during transport. The height of a roof rack on a SUV or van can make it difficult to hoist gear onto the roof and secure it.
Trunk racks are an economical choice for people who only need to transport bikes once in a while. Some care must be taken when installing it to avoid scratching the car's paint. The main downside is the trunk cannot be opened when the rack is installed. Also, the straps can be cut, so bikes are less secure from theft.
Hitch racks require a Class II hitch or higher. Because hitch racks can hold up to 5 bikes, it can be the ideal choice for a family of bikers. The main downside is it may block access to a rear hatch, although more expensive models swing out of the way.
Spare-tire racks don't inhibit rear-door access, and they can be adapted to accommodate other gear and carriers. However, they are limited to vehicles with a spare tire mounted on the back.

Know what part of the blade to change.,
Measure the size blade you need and buy replacement blades.,
Raise the metal wiper arm away from the windshield.,
Unhook the old wiper blade.,
Insert the new wiper.,
Repeat with the second wiper.,
Examine the wipers for cracks.,
Pay attention next time it rains.",How to Change the Wiper Blades on Your Car," Windshield wipers are made with three basic parts: the lower wiper arm that extends from the base of the windshield, the metal or plastic blade attached to the lower arm, and the rubber blade that actually wipes the windshield. When your windshield wiper blades are changed, you're really only changing the rubber blades that get worn down by water and inclement weather.;
, To find out what size replacement blades you need, measure the old rubber blades using a ruler or measuring tape. Write down the exact measurements, then go to an auto parts store and buy rubber blades in those exact sizes.









Don't assume that the left and right wiper take the same size blade. One side is often an inch or two shorter than the other.
Wiper blades usually run about $15.00 a piece. You'll save the cost of labor by installing them yourself.

, It should be able to hold steady in a position perpendicular to the windshield. Be careful with the positioning; the metal wiper arm is spring-loaded, and it could snap back and crack your windshield.








, Look at the joint where the rubber wiper blade meets the metal arm. There should be a small plastic stopper holding the blade in place. Press the stopper and unhook the old wiper blade to separate it from the metal arm.









Some wiper blades have pins to hold the rubber wiper blade in place, rather than a hook.
Make sure one hand is holding the wiper away from the windshield during this entire process.
You may want to protect your windshield with a folded towel, just in case you the arm snaps back while you're trying to change the wiper.

, Slide the refill wiper into the same end of the arm where you pulled the old wiper out. Gently pivot the new wiper until the hook snaps into place to secure it. Lay the wiper back against the windshield.








, The procedure is exactly the same for replacing the second wiper. Just make sure you use the correct size for each side.








, Old windshield wipers become hard and cracked over time, especially in hot, dry climates. If your wiper seems to have lost it's rubbery spring, it's probably time to replace it.

, If your wipers leave streaks of water across your windshield that aren't much easier to see through than pounding rain, their rubber has probably lost its grip.

Make sure the cargo box length is right for your vehicle.,
Consider the color.",How to Choose a Car Rack or Carrier2," These containers are lockable and have hard sides that can't be cut through. The downside is they are expensive and bulky to store when not in use.

, These lightweight bags can be rolled up and tucked into a small storage space. Cargo bags with thicker UV material and sturdy zippers will last longer. Look for a bag with a vinyl backing if you want it to be waterproof.

, Cargo boxes usually have a more aerodynamic shape than cargo bags and won't be flapping in the wind like cargo bags. A car back carrier, which attaches to a luggage rack on the back of a SUV or van, has the benefit of no aerodynamic drag.

, You don't want it to be so long that the rear hatch hits it when lifted opened. If the cargo box extends past the front windshield, it can catch updraft and affect steering.

, Light-colored cargo boxes are usually priced higher as they will absorb less heat than black.

Decide which part of the wiper you need to replace.,
Buy the proper blades for your car model at an automotive-supply store.,
Pull the entire wiper assembly arm away from the windshield and into a standing position.,

Begin by locating the pads at end of the blade; the pads should have small tabs sticking out.,
Slide the rubber insert off of the wiper arm.,
Take out the new rubber insert.,
Gently push the blade back down to a resting position against the windshield and then repeat with the other rubber insert.",How to Install Wiper Blades," The wiper assembly consists of two parts: the arm and a wiper blade that attaches to the metal arm. The rubber insert that rests against the glass of the windshield is for the most part is not available separately.









If the wiper blade isn’t resting against the glass with enough tension or has become bent, you’ll need to replace the entire blade.;
, Ask a salesperson to help you select the right wipers, or, alternatively, measure each of the old wipers first and bring the measurements with you into the store.









Remember that the left and right wiper blades may be different lengths.

, Move the wiper into a position perpendicular to the metal arm. Repeat with the other wiper arm.









Some wipers will only come two to three inches away from the windshield; if that’s the case, don’t try to force the wipers up any further.
On some cars it may be easier to turn on the wipers and when they start to move turn off the ignition. This will allow you to move the arm up to have better access to remove the wiper blade.

, Locate the small tab on the underside of wiper blade (near where the rubber insert meets the metal arm), then push it in (or in some cases, pull on it) to release. Pull down on the blade and it should then slide off the hook of the metal arm.









You may need to tap or tug on the blade a bit to remove it if there’s built up debris or corrosion.
Sometimes it helps to push the wiper up into the holder, press the tab, and then remove.
The bare metal arms are now exposed, and, if left in the standing position, they can snap back and damage your windshield. So, to be safe, gently place the metal arms back against the windshield until you’re ready to put on the new ones.
To be extra safe, place a rag or cloth underneath the metal arm while it rests on the windshield.

, If the left and right wipers are different sizes, be sure to match the new wiper to the correct side. Push the movable hinge on the new blade until the hinge is perpendicular to the rest of the blade.








, Push the metal hook through the hole in the blade.









The metal hook should push up against the rubber insert.

, Gently push the blade back down to a resting position against the windshield.









Repeat with the other wiper blade.

, If the wiper arm angle is off it can cause chattering. The rule of thumb is that the blade is 90 degrees to the glass mid-swipe The reason for mid-swipe is it will change angle from the top of the windshield to the bottom of the windshield due to the curvature of the glass.








,









If the new wipers are streaky, first try cleaning the rubber insert with alcohol wipes or a cloth soaked in mineral spirits. If the wipers are still streaky, check that the blades are properly installed. Verify that you’ve installed each blade on the correct side and check that the wiper is properly oriented. If all else fails, stop by your local auto-parts store for help.

,









Push in the tabs and pull up on the blade to slip it off the assembly. If you find pushing the tabs in to be difficult, you can use a pair of needle-nose pliers to help you.
On some models, the wiper arm must be removed so that the rubber insert can be replaced correctly.

, Once the tabs are past the blade clamp (near the center of the blade), release the tabs and pull the rubber insert completely free of the arm.









The blade is now exposed, and, if left in the standing position, it can snap back and damage your windshield. To be safe, gently place the bare blades back against the windshield until you’re ready to put on the new rubber inserts. To be extra safe, place a rag or cloth underneath the blade while it rests against the windshield.

, If the left and right wipers are different sizes, be sure to match the new insert to the correct blade. Slide the new rubber insert onto the blade, starting at the same end you just pulled the old one away from.









When the insert is in place, be sure the clamps on the blade are securely holding it in place. Verify that the far pad is secured in place by the last clamp.

,









If the new wipers are streaky, first try cleaning the rubber insert with alcohol wipes or a cloth soaked in mineral spirits. If the wipers are still streaky, check that the blades are properly installed: verify that you’ve installed each blade on the correct side and check that the wiper is properly oriented.

There are many places to get car rental coupons.",How to Use a Car Rental Coupon1," You can find them online, in magazines, the yellow pages, newspaper ads and from visitor guides. The coupon you use will depend on where you rent (some coupons will only work in the U.S. or Canada and only at corporate locations) the size of the vehicle you rent and the length of your rental. The following are the most common types of car rental coupons.

"
"
Know what type of 'Money Off' coupon it is.,
What is the required rental time.,
Check to see if there are certain days it applies.,
What size is the car?",How to Use a Car Rental Coupon2," Money off coupons can range from 5 to 50 dollars off your total rental price. (money always comes off at the end of the rental after the taxes and fees are calculated);
, The amount of money off usually depends on the number of rental days and sometimes the size of the vehicle that you are renting.


If a coupons says $$ off a long-term rental, that's usually for 30 days or more.

, Most money off coupons will work on weekly or weekend rentals. See the terms and conditions on each coupon for specifics.(Make sure to get out your magnifying glass!)


Generally, a weekly rental consists of 5 or more days that include a Saturday night. A weekend rental consists of a minimum of three days, maximum of 5. They usually must begin some time on a Thursday and end before close of business on Monday.

, Most coupons only work on compact, mid or full size cars. There are a few out there that will work on an SUV or minivan. The back of each coupon will list the sizes available for that particular coupon.

For example if a company classifies its sizes from compact/mid/standard/full/premium, and you wanted a full size; you would book the mid-size and may receive an upgrade to a full size.


Don't forget...may receive an upgrade. Most coupons state some variation of ""The upgraded car is subject to availability at the time of rental""

, Keep this in mind if you require a certain size. If you need a full size, book it and upgrade to a premium. If the price of the full size is more than you would like, book the full size and use a money off coupon instead.

Pay close attention to the gasoline portion of the rental agreement when you first hire the car.",How to Save Money Renting a Car in the United States," No one rental car agency consistently offers the best rates, so it pays to shop around. Common United States car rental agencies include Avis, Advantage, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, Payless, National, Thrifty, Enterprise and Alamo.


You can compare car rental prices directly with the rental agency or online through most travel aggregators, such as Orbitz, Priceline, Expedia, Travelocity or World Choice.
You might also be able to get better rates by shopping with locally owned, independent car rental agencies. The best way of finding these is to consult a local phone book or through an Internet search.;
, Adding extra drivers might cost you a fee per extra driver.


Your primary driver should be over 25 years old if at all possible. Some United States rental agencies will charge higher fees to renting to a driver under 25, and others might refuse to rent to drivers under 25 at all.
Inquire about special discounts. Members of AAA (the American Automobile Association) often receive discounts on travel-related services including rental cars. If you're a member of any roadside-assistance or travel associations in your home country, check whether they have discount partnerships with AAA or any American rental car companies.

,


If your personal insurance doesn't cover you, check with your travel insurance (if you have any) and with the bank that issued the credit card you plan to use for hiring a car. If neither source offers coverage for a rental car, you might have to pay extra for rental insurance.
If your car insurance, credit card company or travel insurance offers rental car coverage, bring proof of that coverage with you to forestall any paperwork hassles.

, You're often given the choice of returning the car with a full gas tank, or paying a set gasoline fee for the privilege of not having to return the tank full.


The set gasoline fee is usually much more expensive than refilling the tank yourself. But if you forget to fill the tank up before you return the car, you'll incur even higher fees.

Using a comparison site like AutoSlash or KAYAK can help you find the best deal and decide the right rental company for you.


Inquire about hidden fees. When you find a rental company that you like and would potentially rent from, check the company website. One-way rentals often have additional fees that round-trip rentals don’t. The drop-off surcharge, which some companies charge for leaving the car somewhere other than where you picked it up, can add up to hundreds of dollars. It’s advisable to see what the company’s website says about these fees.;
, Individual rental companies will often offer special deals, extras, and coupons on one-way rentals. These can range from 24 hour roadside assistance to unlimited mileage to a reduction of up to 35% on your price if you pay when you book your reservation instead of when you drop-off the car.You can search for these discounts on the website of your selected rental company, through membership programs with AAA or AARP, or on a general site like Groupon or RetailMeNot.

, A large national chain like Budget, Hertz, or Enterprise will offer more places to drop the car off than will a small company. Not only does this give you more options, but prices will typically be cheaper for companies with multiple drop-off locations., Car rental companies offer an array of options, including economy, full-size sedans, minivans, SUVs, and pickup trucks. Choose a model depending on your specific needs, but be aware that some car rental companies will only offer larger cars for one-way rentals., Check with your auto insurance company to see if the coverage you have for your main vehicle also extends to a rental car. It is likely that it will if you have full coverage, but it’s best to double-check by checking your insurance policy.Buy insurance over the phone or online instead of at the counter. The rates will likely be lower, and you won’t feel pressured to purchase insurance that you actually may not need., You can do this online, over the phone, or in person, whichever option is most convenient for you.


List additional drivers, if applicable. This may cost more, but if you plan on letting somebody else drive, the liability will be on you if an accident happens.Read over the rental agreement line by line and ask the service representative any questions you may have about the contract. It is better to be certain of what you’re signing than to have to face any surprises during your trip.

Practice.",How to Rent a Car in Australia," Before you rent a car in Australia, acquaint yourself with laws and requirements for renting, or ""hiring,"" a car. Not only will this help you decide if you qualify to rent a car in Australia, but also whether or not it is a feasible option for your trip.


You must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car. Some companies charge drivers between the ages of 21 and 25 an extra fee. Some also have a maximum age limit of 75.You must have a valid driver's license for the type of car you want to rent. If you are from an English speaking country, all you need is your license. If your driver's license is in a language that is not English, you must have an international driver's license in addition to any non-English language one. Australian car rental companies do not accept probationary licenses (or driver's permits) or photocopies of licenses. The website dmv.org has information on how to obtain an international driver's license as well as a list of FAQ's on international driving.Auto insurance is required to rent a car. Companies require two policies: Collision Damage Waiver and Theft Insurance. Collision Damage Waiver, which costs approximately $10-30/ day, reduces any deductible you might owe the rental company in the event of an accident.Theft insurance covers the loss of the car itself and not any of your belonging in it.However, there are optional policies for personal accidents and personal effects. Inquire with your rental company for more information on this.
Rental companies do not allow their cars on ferries. They also may forbid driving rental cars into or out of certain areas including Tasmania, Western Australia, the Northern Territories, and New Zealand.Seat belts are required, and there is no tolerance for drunk driving.;
, Australia is a large country, and places that may look close on a map are actually hundreds of miles away. Mapping out possible excursions is advisable. Consider this as you decide where to drive and rent your car.


For example, Sydney to Melbourne is 860km (534 miles), while Sydney to Perth is 3,942km (2450 miles).Australia has a great road network. Outside of cities in areas known as the Outback, though, roads may be dirt and there can be long distances in between cities or town or even the next fuel and food stops. The Australian Travel and Tourism Network has several different road maps of Australia you can consult and includes information on toll roads., There is some basic information about Australia and driving there to know before you book. Wikitravel has an excellent, in-depth article on everything from driving in the Outback to traffic accidents and animals you may encounter on road trips.Australians drive on the left hand side of the road. The steering wheel is on the right hand side of the car. Driving in Australia will require you to shift how you drive from turning, exiting highways, and passing other vehicles. You need to be comfortable with this change and can always drive on smaller roads for a couple of hours once you pick up your car to acclimate yourself to the new driving conditions.
Australia uses the metric system. Speed and distance signs are in kilometers. Fuel (called petrol) is sold in liters.

, You can either rent your car online before you depart or rent at a car rental company once you arrive in Australia. It's generally significantly less expensive, though, to book online or by phone with a rental company before you depart. Rental companies will often ""sell out"" of cars and may not have a vehicle for you, or one that is in your price range, if you wait to rent a car until you arrive.

, There are innumerable companies from which to rent a car either online, by phone, or in person. Most major car rental companies have offices in Australian cities and at airports from where you can pick up your car. These include Budget, Sixt, and Thrifty. There are also local Australian car rental companies. The Australian Travel and Tourism Network can direct you to one of these companies, which are often dependent on where you wish to rent.If you're looking for the best value on renting a car and insurance, check the prices of different companies and renting in different locations. It's often less expensive to rent in a city than at an airport. Major rental car companies have websites that provide information and a portal for making a car rental reservation. Using travel websites such as Kayak or Expedia will allow you to compare prices on one site.Consult travel reviews if you want more information on companies or their policies. Tripadvisor has the comments of persons who have rented cars in Australia. Their experiences can give you an idea of which companies have the best policies and prices., Once you've identified a few car rental companies, compare their prices and policies. Prices can vary greatly from company to company, so it's in your best interest to look at several options. Make sure to read the fine print on items such as insurance, fees, and mileage. Note that most companies require a credit card and will not accept debit cards with credit card logos.


Some companies will not include the price of insurance or fees in their offer, making it appear less expensive. Acquaint yourself with each company's insurance policies and fee structure. You may be able to get a better rate for insurance through your personal insurance or credit card company.
Some companies don't offer one-way rentals, or picking up a rental car in one city and dropping it off in another city. The company may also charge a fee for a one-way rental. If you want to drive from Sydney to Perth, for example, make sure the company offers one-way rentals as well as for this distance.
Not all rental car companies offer unlimited mileage on rentals. If you're driving long distances, make sure to check that the offer you choose has an unlimited mileage option. Otherwise, you could end up with a car that allows only 300km per day with a high fee for any miles beyond that you drive, which could get very expensive.
Make sure to read any fine print on the offer. It's important to read the entire offer so that you don't encounter any surprises once you pick up your car. The fine print will give you information on everything from insurance policies, administrative fees, and mileage limits.
Additional drivers may cost more money. Many rental companies have an additional daily fee for each extra driver.

, Once you've found an offer that best suits you, you're ready to travel and enjoy the comfort your rent car brings.


Print out your rental car information and confirmation once you've booked. If you book over the phone, write down the details including the confirmation number. You can also ask for an email confirmation or one in the post. Having this information will help you once you arrive to pick up your rental car.

, As you prepare for your trip, make sure to take all documentation required by the car rental company with you. Many companies will also ask for a copy of your passport.


Keep a copy of your booking confirmation with you. This will eliminate any questions on items such as the price, dates of rental, or mileage limits.
If you rent a car without a reservation, take your personal documents as well. Renting without a reservation can be more expensive than booking early. If you arrive at a rental car company without a reservation, prepare yourself that they may not have any available for when you want.

, Ask the rental agent any questions you have about the car, driving in Australia, fuel, rest stops, or even your rental agreement.


Ask if the car is automatic or stick shift. If you can't drive stick shift, make sure to let the rental agent know so they can book you an automatic vehicle. Be aware that many companies outside of the United States charge extra for automatic vehicles.
Ask about what kind of fuel the car requires. It may need diesel fuel instead of unleaded gas. Ask the agent if there is a map of fuel stops (called filling stations) in Australia as they may be far apart. BP and Shell both offer fuel finders for Australia.\
Ask if the car has any known damages. Your rental agreement should have these listed. If they don't, make sure the rental agent notes them so you do not get charged for damages you didn't incur.
Ask questions about your insurance policy. Make sure you have the minimum Collision Damage Waiver and Theft Insurance. You can then decide if you would like to add policies that cover theft of your personal items, which may be covered by your personal insurance or credit card company. Inquire in advance to learn your different insurance options.
Rental companies often have driving maps for clients. If you don't have a map or forgot to bring one with you, ask your rental agent if the company offers free maps or more detailed road maps you can purchase.

, Checking over the car in the rental agency's parking lot is a great idea. Taking these few minutes can save you many headaches and a lot of money.


Ensure that there is no damage that isn't already listed on the rental agreement. If you see anything not listed on the rental agreement, let the rental agent know. This will save you from being charged fees for damages you didn't incur.
Ask any additional questions you might have about driving the car or how it functions.

, Plan to practice before you set out on a full day of driving or in areas of heavy traffic. This step is important if you're not used to driving with the steering wheel on the left hand side of the car as well as on the left side of the road.


Taking a little time to practice this new skill is advisable. It can save you from making mistakes that may cost you time or money, or even from causing an automobile accident.

Purchase renter’s insurance when renting a car.",How to React if Your Rental Car Breaks Down," Whether your rental car breaks down while stopped in a parking lot or while driving down the freeway, you should never react by panicking. Always stay calm, and keep a level head. If you’re driving, steer the car to the side of the road and bring the vehicle to a complete stop.If you have roadside safety devices, such as flares or reflective devices, set these up on the side of the highway so that oncoming traffic will avoid your car.
Do not attempt to drive the car further after a breakdown. Doing so could further damage the vehicle and put yourself and passengers at risk.;
, If your broken-down rental car was involved in an accident, or if the car breaks down at night, or in an unsafe or unfamiliar area, you may need to call for help. Once you’re safely out of traffic, use your cell phone to call 911, or your insurance company’s roadside assistance phone number, depending on the severity of the incident.Conversely, if the car breaks down in a safe, populated area and has no one is injured, you may not need to phone the police. In a safe situation, first call your car-rental company, and then call a tow truck if necessary.

, If you can safely exit the rental car and stand in a location where you won’t be hit by passing vehicles (i.e. not the middle of a road), inspect the car to determine where the breakdown occurred. If the failure was mechanical, you’ll need to convince the rental car company that you were not at fault and should not be held liable to pay for the car damage.Use your phone camera (or an actual camera) to take photographs of the damage or broken parts, if it’s visible.
If you were at fault for the breakdown, through negligence or irresponsible driving, you will likely need to pay for the damages.

, The document that you signed before driving the rental car off the lot should have clauses which describe who will be at fault for various types of damages to the vehicle. If you know how the rental car has broken down, check the agreement to see if you will be required to pay for parts and repairs. In general, unless you were directly at fault, you shouldn’t have to pay.


In general, when renting a car, plan ahead and always read through the rental agreement before signing. Well-known rental agencies are generally ethical companies, but smaller agencies may sneak in clauses which hold you responsible for all damages.

, It’s generally the responsibility of the rental company to tow the broken-down rental car and to replace the car, so you still have a functional car to drive. However, some companies may bicker over this policy.Regardless, inform the company immediately: explain the incident, state where and how the car broke down, and ask for a replacement vehicle.


When you call, say something like, “I rented a car from your agency two days ago, and the vehicle just broke down on the side of Interstate I-70, by mile marker 400. I’d like to have a replacement vehicle; how should I have this car towed and exchange it for another?”
It may be easier to arrange transportation if your car broke down in the same city as the rental agency’s offices. In an instance like this, say, “My rental car is broken down at a gas station across town. I can’t get the engine to start, but if I take a taxi to your office, could you set me up with a replacement rental vehicle?”
The rental agreement will usually specify that you must call the company immediately in the case of a breakdown—follow this guidance, as failing to do so may put you at risk for significant fees., The rental car company may ask you to pay for the towing service and repairs to the vehicle—this may even be specified in the contract. If so, the company should also reimburse you for repair fees when you return the car. To ensure that this happens, take notes on what mechanics fixed, and keep the receipts from all maintenance done to the vehicle.Even if the breakdown is not serious—i.e. the air conditioning doesn’t work—you should still notify the rental company as soon as you note the malfunction.The sooner the company knows about a problem, the less likely they’ll be to hold you financially responsible.

, Once you’ve communicated with the rental company, you’ll need to call your own insurance company. Explain the circumstances of the breakdown and describe the specific problem with the rental car. Clarify whether or not you are at fault for the breakdown, and ask if damages and repairs will be covered by your insurance.When you call your insurance company, state, “I’m driving a rental car in Florida, and the car just broke down on the side of the road. The engine stopped running, although I did nothing to put me at fault. If the rental company refuses to pay, will my car insurance cover the cost of repairs?”
If the breakdown-related damages are not your fault and the rental agreement states that the rental company will pay, your insurance company may not need to get involved. It’s still best to contact the insurance company though, in case the rental company tries to make you pay for damages for which you were not at fault.

, Before traveling, you should find out ahead of time what type of rental-car coverage your insurance company provides. Even if you have a good vehicle insurance plan, if you get into an accident in your rental car, your insurance will likely only cover damages to the other vehicle, leaving you responsible to cover damages to the rental car.To start this conversation, try explaining, “I’m going to be renting a car soon in Alabama. Does my car insurance cover my own vehicle in the case of a breakdown, or if I get into an accident in the rental?”
Tell the company whether you’re traveling for business or pleasure, as this may make a difference in the insurance rental-car coverage.
Also ask if your insurance will cover fees charged by the rental agency, for example, repair and towing costs.

, If your insurance company does not provide coverage for damages to rental cars, you can work around this problem by purchasing rental insurance from the rental company before you begin driving the car—this will insure any damages to the rental car for which you are responsible.Some rental companies may also sell a “liability waiver.” This will clear you from liability and financial responsibility if you are at fault for damages to the vehicle."

Walk away if you think something is fishy, or suspect you're being taken advantage of.,
Know the relationship between a car's residual value and monthly payments.The vehicle’s residual value is the value of the car after you've finished leasing it; it's useful if you decide to buy the car after your lease is up.,
Don't get so obsessed with the monthly payment number that you forget about fees.,
Check for any rebates associated with the car.,
Look over the lease agreement.,
Enjoy your beautiful, new car.",How to Lease a Car," When you lease a car, you make a small down payment (typically less than 20% of the car's retail price) and then make smaller monthly payments until the term of the lease is up. When the term is up, you hand the keys — and the car — back to the dealer. There are both drawbacks and advantages to leasing.


The drawbacks:
You don't own the car when the lease term is up.
Leasing several cars over a long period of time is more expensive than investing in a single car.
You may have to pay fees if you go over the number of miles on your contract; inflict damage or cause wear on the car's interior, exterior, or driving performance; trade in the car before your lease term is up.


The advantages:
You can drive a car whose retail price you can't afford.
If you don't hold onto your cars for a long time, leasing can ultimately save you more money.

;
, If the car that you've been driving in your dream is, on average, $250 dollars over your monthly maximum, it probably won't make sense to go into debt in order to finance the car. So hammer out a budget, stick to it, and find out what options you have based on your available money.

, Identify the car or cars that you want to commit to. If you don't have a firm idea of what kind of car you want, including options, color, and interior, among others, a salesman is going to try to convince you to upgrade based on what he wants to sell, not what you want to buy.


Reduce your overall costs by choosing cars that have great gas mileage, good safety features, low maintenance costs, and time-tested dependability. Just because you can lease a Mercedes Benz doesn't mean you should ignore the Honda.
Talk with your insurance agent about models that will keep your insurance premium low. If your insurance currently covers a 2004 GM, but you're thinking of upgrading to a Jaguar, your insurance premiums aren't going anywhere but north.
Understand your insurance responsibilities. You will pay for the insurance on the car even if the leasing company says they supply it. In that case, the monthly payment is rolled into your lease payment.



, Go to the dealer with no intention of leasing — in fact, don't mention yet that you're planning on leasing — and instead take one car you have in sight out for a test drive. Pay attention to how the car makes you feel, and how it performs under limited pressure. The following aspects will make the most difference when the time comes for you to use your vehicle on an ongoing basis.:


Head and legroom
Seating
Visibility (especially blind spots)
Engine power
Handling
Controls

, If you anticipate needing to secure financing for a down payment on your vehicle and don't have the cash ready, go to a bank or credit union to get the financing. Don't get financing at the dealership. Too often, this results in bad deals for the customer and great deals for the dealership.

, The leasing option you get on your car will depend on the negotiated purchase price. The lower the total price of the car, the lower the payment, even with leasing. It's best to have this hammered down first, and in writing, so that the salesperson cannot step back and try to hoodwink you once you get down to the nitty gritty details.


Know about the invoice price of the car. The invoice price is the price the dealer paid for the car. While it's not reasonable to expect to negotiate a price at or lower than the invoice, it's a good general area to shoot for. Your final negotiated price should be somewhere between the invoice and the suggested retail price.
Walk away if the salesperson brings a four-square worksheet into the negotiation. A four-square worksheet is a sleight-of-hand trick the dealership uses to confuse the buyer about their options. Some dealers work with it extensively. If your salesperson brings one out, tell him that you won't continue negotiating until it's been put away.

, The bigger your initial down payment, the lower your monthly payments will be. At the same time, you may be able to get a deal with no down payment and a relatively low monthly payment, according to US News best lease deals of 2013.Know what your total ""capitalized cost"" will be. Your capitalized cost is a fancy terms for the negotiated price of the vehicle, plus the acquisition cost, plus the destination fee.This is the money you'll be paying, not including the monthly payments, in order to lease the car.
Factor in any ""capitalized cost reductions."" Capitalized cost reduction is any cash down payment, trade-in credit, or rebate that reduces your total capitalized cost.

, Dealerships are hard places to feel like both parties have actually gotten what they wanted. Too often, the customer feels a sour taste in his or her mouth after they learn of ""fees"" and ""adjustments"" that are tacked on to the final cap cost. If you're not afraid to walk away from the dealership, the dealer is forced to bargain with you — the honest way. You're telling them that you're a straight shooter, and you won't tolerate any tricks or nonsense.

,


You'd think you'd want a low residual value on your car after your lease is up. Say your car is worth $20,000, and the residual value is worth $10,000 after a 3-year lease. That means that you can buy the car for $10,000 after three years.
Great, right? Not always. If you the residual is $10,000 after three years, that means you use up $10,000 of the car's value during those three years. That means your average monthly payment, divided by 36 months, is $277 plus interest and fees.
What if your residual is $13,000 after three years? That means you use up $7,000 of the car's value, setting your average monthly payment at $194. Higher residuals mean lower monthly fees, although lower residuals mean you can buy the car for less once the lease is done.

, Dealerships are smart; they'll dangle the magical monthly payment number in front of your eyes, and then pack on fees toward the end of the negotiation, often raising the capitalized cost significantly. After haggling with you for an hour or two, the dealer knows that it seems wasteful for you to derail the negotiation over one $300 fee here, another $75 fee there, and one $650 fee for good measure. They'll use this psychological understanding to their advantage. Don't let them.


Dealerships often levy a fee for turning in a leased car and not leasing another car from the same dealership. This is sometimes called a disposition fee.
Dealerships also levy a fee for deciding to buy the car after the term of the lease has ended. This is sometimes called a purchase fee.
These fees and surcharges are generally negotiable. Remember, the dealer is betting that you're attached to the car enough to eat the fees, even if they're noxious. If you're willing to walk away, the dealer loses much of their power.

, Go to the manufacturer's website directly and look for rebates associated with leasing the car. These rebates are typically applied to the down payment of the car, although they sometimes help lower the residual cost of the vehicle.Be aware that some dealers will misinform you that certain rebates don't apply to leasing arrangements. Don't believe them at their word; certain rebates are specifically designed for leasing arrangements.

, Discuss your financial liability for periodic maintenance and repairs. If you do not understand something, ask for complete clarification. In the end, you are signing a legal document and will be held responsible for what it says. Sign the leasing document if all is agreeable.


Realize that you will easily lose an average of half the value of the car to depreciation when the leasing period is over.

, Make all of your payments on time and pay strict attention to mileage clauses, or this will change what happens when you turn in the car at the end of the lease.

Some employers will only let you use the discount for company travel, but others might let you use the discount for personal travel as well., Many rental car companies offer coupons which can reduce the cost of the rental. Search Google for “coupon code” and the rental company.Groupon has a Car Rental Center that shows available discounts., Many organizations offer their members discounts on rental cars. For example, AARP, the American Automobile Association (AAA), and Costco all offer their members discounts.Look to see if any organization you belong to offers similar discounts.

You might be a member of some of these organizations without knowing it. For example, your automobile’s warranty might have included AAA membership.

, Some rental car companies will cut their rates in half if you rent on the weekend. If your schedule is flexible, plan on renting on the weekend to save big.If you need to rent during the week, then check the company’s weekly rate. Often, it’s cheaper to rent the car for the entire week than for five days at the daily rate.

, Some rental car companies have loyalty programs which allow you to earn points or credits each time you rent a car.For example, the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program is free to join and will give you a free weekend day for 550 points.These programs are a good bet if you intend to rent a car frequently.

However, points might expire with some programs. Accordingly, you should read the fine print.

, Some rental car companies will give you a discount if you pay in advance.Call them up and check whether or not you can save money this way. Generally, you can still get a refund if you need to cancel, but you will have to pay a small cancellation fee."

Rent only the smallest car.,
Have only one driver.,
Skip the extras.,
Research gas rates.",How to Lower Rental Car Costs3," You’ll pay less if you book an economy car, provided it offers enough space for you. If all small cars are being rented, companies will often give you a free upgrade., You’ll pay more if you want to add a driver. For example, Enterprise charges about $12 per day for an extra driver. Check whether the rental car company will charge extra to add your spouse, since some will waive that fee.Some memberships (such as Costco) also let you get a free additional driver.

, To rent as cheaply as possibly, you should forgo many of the extras offered by the rental company. For example, check whether you can do without the following:

GPS. Some companies will charge $15 a day. If you have a smart phone, you can use its GPS instead.
Insurance. Your primary insurance should cover you provided you aren’t renting for business purposes.Check with your insurer. Your credit card might also offer basic insurance if you use the card to book the rental.
Toll pass. You need to pay tolls. However, some rental companies include a toll pass which is often more expensive than what you can buy for yourself in a store.

, The rental car company might offer a fuel service option (also called a fuel plan). However, they can be more expensive than what you might pay at a gas station. Do your research ahead of time using GasBuddy.com.Fill up the car before returning it and avoid the fuel service charge. Make sure you have a copy of your gas station receipt."

Use travel websites.,
Search for deals on consolidated car rental websites.,
Look for deals on airline or hotel websites.,
Get deals through Groupon.",How to Get a Discount Car Rental Rate1," Travel websites like Expedia, Hotwire, Travelocity, etc., offer a ‘one stop shop’ for items like hotels and car rentals. These websites allow you to search for car rentals in specific locations and for a specific time frame, but unlike a car rental agency's website, you can compare the prices between multiple companies.Travel websites usually have consistent cancellation polices between rental companies, so you don’t need to look up separate policies for each company.Some travel websites also have their own reward points which can be earned on anything booked via the website, regardless of the company you book with. You can then apply these reward points to future bookings made on the same site.
Travel websites may also display comments on whether a particular listing is considered a good deal or not. This can help direct you towards listings that are displaying discounts and price reductions.
Some travel websites provide you with the option to compare prices between multiple travel websites to ensure you really are getting the best deal possible.Some travel websites may also provide a price guarantee, so if you book a car rental and find a cheaper deal within a certain period of time, the website will honour the lower price (and sometimes give you something extra). Keep in mind, however, that you have to be the one who finds this alternate deal. If you stop searching for a car rental after you’ve booked one, you’ll never be able to take advantage of this guarantee.;
, In addition to travel websites that offer deals on multiple types of travel items (e.g. hotels, flights, etc.), there are also websites that specialize in car rental deals. Two well known sites are CarRentals.com and AutoRentals.com.


Similar to a travel website, simply enter the location where you want to pick-up the car, and the dates you need the car, and the website will search all possible options.
Once the website has finished searching, it will display a list of prices for the location and dates you’ve specified, from multiple car rental agencies. This method allows you to compare deals all on one page.Note that many of these car rental websites are owned and operated by the same companies that operate the travel websites, therefore the deals may not be any different. For example, CarRentals.com is owned by Expedia.

, Many major hotel chains and airlines partner with car rental agencies in order to offer their customers special discounts. For airlines, you can often find information pertaining to car rental discounts right on their website.For hotels, you can speak to someone at the concierge desk, or visit the car rental agency right inside the hotel.Many car rental agencies have offices right inside hotels. While this may be super convenient, it may not always be the least expensive option available.

, Groupon has a Car Rental Centre under their Getaways link that shows all available discounts and deals for car rental agencies.Unlike other Groupon deals where you have to purchase an actual Groupon coupon via the website and then use it at the store, most car rental discounts will simply link you directly to the car rental agency's website with a specific coupon code.
You can then select your location and dates, and the coupon code is already included when you checkout.

"
Agree to pay for your rental early.,
Join a rental car company’s frequent renter program.,
Increase your rental time.",How to Get a Discount Car Rental Rate2," Some rental car companies will provide you with a discount if you pay for the entire rental up-front, rather than when you pick-up or return the car. This can be especially helpful when the car you’re renting has unlimited mileage, so you know the price you’re paying up-front will not change later., Most car rental agencies have loyalty programs that give points to frequent renters. Signing up for such programs is usually free, and may even provide other advantages (e.g. easier checkin, etc.).Most of these loyalty programs work for any rental you book worldwide, as long as it’s with the same agency.
If you rent cars frequently, but don’t always use the same agency, sign-up for more than one loyalty program so you always receive points.
Be careful as points can expire, or memberships can become inactive, if you don’t meet certain criteria.

, Car rental agencies will charge a lower price per day the longer you rent a car. For example, booking a car for 1 week will be cheaper than if you book it for 6 days. If you’re able to book a car for a longer period of time, you’ll pay less per day."
"
Speak to a travel agent.,
Become a member at Costco.,
Take advantage of group or association memberships.,
Join the CAA or AAA.,
Borrow your company’s discount.",How to Get a Discount Car Rental Rate3," Travel agents are able to book car rentals directly with a car rental agency. In some cases they may be able to provide you with discounts not available elsewhere. If you’ve booked other parts of your travel with an agent, ask them about any car rental deals they may be able to offer you., If you are a member at a Costco warehouse, you can use your membership to book car rentals. Use their website CostcoTravel.com to book. Costco has discounts with more than one car rental agency, and will display a price chart so you can compare deals.You can also use the website to view coupons they have for specific car rental agencies, and you can search for rental deals from specific agencies that they’ve partnered with (Alamo, Avis, Budget, and Enterprise).

, Groups and associations often partner with one or more car rental agency to offer their members car rental discounts. If you are a member of any group, check the group's website to see if they have a car rental discount available. Groups could include alumni associations, trade organizations, professional associations, etc.Note that most groups will only have deal with one or two car rental agencies, so your options may be limited.

, The Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) and the American Automobile Association (AAA) offer car rental discounts to members. You can book these deals via the CAA/AAA website, in-person at a CAA/AAA location, or by phone.While the CAA/AAA may have partnered with one or two specific car rental agencies for deals, many other car rental agencies will offer discounts if you have a CAA/AAA membership. However, you’ll need to book the rental directly through the agency.Keep in mind that even if you never purchased a CAA/AAA membership, your car’s warranty may include membership., Companies that book a lot of travel often have special discounts due to this volume. Some companies will allow their employees to use these discounts for personal travel as well. If your company has a travel booking website, review the policies to see if you can use it for personal travel.

Get GAP insurance.",How to Get an Open End Car Lease," Open and closed ended leases operate in very much the same manner throughout the life of the contract. The difference between the two lies in what happens upon the end of the agreed upon timeframe. Closed end leases are more common for consumers, as you can simply return the car at the completion of the contract with no additional financial responsibilities unless the vehicle requires repairs.You are responsible for this balloon payment regardless of the actual value of the car at the end of the contract.;
, When signing an open ended lease, you are agreeing to pay a balloon payment of the remainder of the anticipated value of the car at the end of the lease, which means you run the risk of losing value. By agreeing to an open ended lease, you are promising to pay the sum of money at the end of the contract, regardless of the actual value of the car by then.If the value of the car is higher than predicted at the end of your lease agreement, you may gain value by buying out the lease.
If the car is worth less than anticipated, you are still responsible to pay the balloon payment dictated at the signing of the lease.
If you are concerned that you may end up having to pay more than the car is worth in the end, an open ended lease may not be right for you.

, There are different leasing options available to you based on what you intend to use the car for and how long you hope to keep it. Open ended leasing is often used for businesses as opposed to consumers because of the balloon payment required at the end, but may offer advantages to you based on your situation.Think about how much mileage you intend to put on your car. Closed ended leases will give you mileage limits, with financial penalties for exceeding them. Open ended leases have no mileage limits.
Consider whether or not you hope to keep the car you lease. If you do not, a closed ended lease would make more sense for you.

, You cannot usually lease used cars, so you will need to choose a new vehicle that you are interested in leasing and ultimately owning. Consider what you will be using your vehicle for and use that to help narrow down your choices.If you are going to be transporting people or goods, consider the storage available in cars, SUVs or trucks. Depending on what you will be carrying, you may need to choose one over the others.
If you are going to be driving a significant number of miles, you may want to consider gas mileage when choosing a new vehicle. Many cars, trucks and SUVs come with different engine options that offer different fuel economy so make sure to research the vehicle you choose.
Consider all of your options when determining what the right car is for you.


, Once you have identified what you intend to you use your new vehicle for and how much you intend to drive it, you should determine a range of monthly prices that you are able to afford. You will likely end up paying more than the total cost of the car by leasing it, so also consider how much more you are willing to pay above retail price. Try creating a budget to determine how large a monthly payment you can afford.Add up your expenses and compare them to your monthly income to establish a basic budget.

Once you know how much you have in your budget to work with, use that to determine what you could afford as a monthly payment.

, Use the decisions you’ve made in the previous steps to narrow down your choices to two or three cars. This will allow you compare their options, prices and benefits to determine the best choice for you. Once you have narrowed down your choices, do some research online about each make and model to see if there are issues with it.


Websites like KBB.com can give you reviews on the car and Recalls.gov can let you know if there have been any recalls on that specific make and model.
Take notes if you’d like. Bring any notes you take with you to the dealership to make sure you have a thorough understanding of the cars you look at.

, Visit dealerships that offer leases on the cars that you are interested in and take each car for a test drive. Pay close attention to your comfort in the car as well as your level of comfort driving and handling the vehicle. It’s important that you choose a car that you feel comfortable in and that you know you can manage.Mention anything that you aren’t sure of during your test drive to the salesperson. There may be an issue with that specific car that they can fix, or you may want to test drive a different car.
Remember not to lease the first car you test drive, although you may be tempted to do so. Instead compare more than one vehicle to get a solid sense of what you want.

, Do not mention that you intend to lease the car until after you have determined the total price with the salesperson. Car dealerships often focus on monthly cost over total price, because they know you will be more apt to accept a lower monthly payment, even if the total price of the vehicle goes up.By negotiating total price before you negotiate the terms of the lease, you know what the maximum cost of your lease will be and possibly limit the size of the final balloon payment you will be expected to pay.
Your monthly lease payments will be based on your overall agreed upon price, so negotiating a total price first will ensure you know what your monthly costs will be.

, Visit more than one dealership and test drive each of the cars you may want to lease. Negotiate a total price and determine what the monthly expenses may be for each.


Keep any documentation you receive from each dealership so you can accurately compare your options at home.
Don’t allow salespeople to pressure you to make a decision right away. Signing a lease is a large financial commitment, and there’s nothing wrong with taking your time.

, Once you have determined the total price, ask the salesperson about leasing options. They may offer different programs with different options available to you. Be sure to specify that you intend to sign an open ended lease agreement, as the paperwork will need to reflect that instead of a more traditional consumer lease.


Some common leasing options may be the option to pay additional sums toward the final payment each month, the ability to transfer the lease to others, or even to extend the time frame of the lease if you need to.
Some companies offer leasing options that include covering more of the maintenance costs of the vehicle. These options may be valuable to you as maintaining the car properly can help keep it’s overall value high.
There may be lease options that include different durations. Remember that you will be responsible for the remainder of the value of the car upon the completion of the lease, so shorter leases will result in a higher final payment.

, In order to minimize your monthly expense as well as the final balloon payment you’ll be responsible for upon the completion of the lease, put down as much as you can up front. The larger your down payment, the less you will have to pay down the road.The more you pay toward the overall cost of the vehicle, the less you will be responsible for later on.
Large down payments don’t make as much sense on closed ended leases, as you will be returning the car regardless upon the end of the lease.

, The fastest and easiest way to reduce the value of your vehicle, believe it or not, is to drive it. The higher the mileage on your vehicle, the less it is worth so limit any unnecessary driving to ensure you maintain the highest possible value for your car.Only use your leased vehicle to drive to places you absolutely have to, in order to avoid putting unnecessary miles on it.
Use GPS to find direct routes to places that you go in order to avoid adding additional miles to your trips.

, Your vehicle will require regular maintenance to keep it running well. Preventative maintenance can keep things from breaking that would result in costly repairs and a well maintained vehicle will retain more value than a poorly maintained one.Get oil changes at the frequency recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. A common rule of thumb is to have your oil changed every 3,000 miles.
Check your user’s manual for scheduled maintenance requirements like changing your air filter, transmission fluid or oil, and fuel filters.

, You will be required to maintain full coverage car insurance on your vehicle throughout the life of your lease, but you may also want to invest in GAP (Guaranteed Auto Protection) coverage. In the event your car depreciates faster than you’d hoped and you get into an accident, your insurance will only cover the value of the car, not the remainder of what you owe. Gap insurance covers that remainder.If your open ended leased car is totaled before you've completed the lease and made the final balloon payment, you are still financially responsible for the full cost of the car. GAP coverage will protect you from having to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket toward the car after an accident if it has depreciated.
You may be able to add gap insurance to your lease at the dealership when you sign the contract.
Most car insurance providers offer gap insurance at an additional cost.

",How to Hire a Limousine," Get your limousine booked as soon as you can. At busy times of the year, such as prom season, limousines get reserved quickly. Wedding planners recommend reserving a limousine 6 months in advance of the event. Find and reserve the limousine you want as soon as you know the date you will need it.;
, Decide if you want a standard limousine, or if you need a larger car with extra amenities, such as television screens and wireless Internet connections. Most limousines can hold between 5 and 14 passengers.

, All limousine companies must carry insurance. Verify their coverage, and ask about whether their cars or chauffeurs have been in any accidents.


Ask how they screen their chauffeurs, and whether they are local to your area. You do not want to risk getting lost.







, What you get for your money will depend on whether you are hiring the limousine for a single and specific trip, or for an entire evening. Most companies provide wedding and prom packages.


Ask the limousine company if there are other charges beyond their hourly or package rate. Some companies will include the gratuity, and there may be other fees to consider as well.







, When you find a limousine you would like to book, you will need to sign a contract for the date and time that you need it. Be sure the contract includes all of the details of your event or trip, including the time of pick up and drop off, your full itinerary, the make, model, and year of the limousine you have chosen, the number of people traveling, rates and any other charges.

, Most limousine companies will require you to put money down at the time of booking. Ask about the terms of the deposit, such as how much is required, and whether it is refundable in the event of cancellation.

, Many limousine companies have strict cancellation policies, so find out if you are able to cancel once you hire your limousine, and what your deadline is to do so.

Find the best deal for your location and the period of time in which you'll need a rental.In the majority of situations, you're best off sticking with one of these agencies, as they are the most widely used and reputable: Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National.Before you decide on an agency, look into and/or ask about their additional fees. These fees can change what agency provides the best deal all things considered. Some common fees include:

Underage-driver fees: Additional charge for a driver under 25.
Airport surcharges: Additional charge for picking up a rental at the airport.
Mileage fees: Additional charges for going over a certain miles per day cap.
Additional driver fees: Additional charges for having more than one person drive the rental.

;
, You can rent a car in any size, from compact to SUV.


Keep in mind that the definitions of terms like ""compact"" and ""luxury-sized"" can vary. Most agency websites will include examples of models or how many passengers can fit in each car size., If you plan on renting a car after landing from a flight, it's worth looking into booking your flight and rental car together. This can often save you money, as better deals and rates will be offered. You can book a flight and a rental car together either with travel websites like http://www.priceline.com/ or with airline websites like https://www.southwest.com/., These might include a GPS system or car seats for the kids. These additions can be factored in while you're going through the online rental process. Different car models will have different options, so keep that in mind as you choose a car size and model


In most cases, you'll be much better off financially by providing these kind of extras yourself, instead of renting them. Avoid extra features unless you absolutely need them and can't provide them yourself., Many personal auto policies and credit card companies include coverage for rental cars, but you also have the option to buy additional coverage. These offers will most often be made at the time of rental. Look for an option to view policies on the rental website you choose to use. Before you make any rental decision call your insurance company to learn about their car rental policy. Most personal auto insurance policies extend whatever coverage you have for your main vehicle to any rental. Expect to pay for insurance and other upgrades on a daily basis. For example, collision insurance might cost you $9 per day of your rental.
For example, if you're using Enterprise.com, you'll see an option in the top right corner to ""view policies"". There you can view their policies for things such as ""Personal Accident Insurance"" and ""Roadside Protection""., Most rental car companies will hold your reservation without any form of payment, while others will require a credit card number.

, You can call the company you plan to use and reserve a pickup time, date and location with a customer service agent.

, If you are renting a car after flying into an airport, follow the signs to rental cars. Often times, the agency's policy will include a large surcharge for picking up at the airport, so consider taking a shuttle to your hotel or the downtown area instead, and picking up a different location.Find out if the rental car company will pick you up. Call and ask about this service. Local car rentals can sometimes be arranged so that a customer service representative will pick you up at home or work and drive you to the rental car company to get your car.

, Make sure all of the information is correct, and the price you were quoted when you reserved is reflected in the contract.Discuss any questions with the customer service agent.

, If you didn't pay online, you'll be required to pay when you arrive at the pick-up location, before you leave with the rental. Provide the reservation number as well as your driver's license and credit card.


It's often recommend to pay with a credit card when possible. Credit card companies will often cover some of your insurance, which makes using a credit card in this instance a smart option for many.Different car rental companies have various policies on whether debit cards can be used. It's worth calling the rental place beforehand to ask about their policy when it comes to debit cards.

Some require a credit card and will not accept debit cards.
Others will allow you to pay at the end with a debit card, but require a credit card in order to rent the car.
Some will allow you use a debit card only if you're dropping the car off where you picked it up.
Some require a pre-authorization charge that puts some of your funds on hold until you drop off the car.



, You want to make sure any scratches, dents or problems are documented so you are not held liable for these when you return the car. Be thorough here. You want to look for problems both big and small. Make sure the windows work properly. Make sure there's no loose parts, dysfunctional lights, leaks, or anything that could be considered damage. If there is, record and take a picture or video of it., Collect the keys and a copy of your contract and drive the car off the rental lot.

, Be sure to tell the rental company if you're crossing a country border in the rental. You'll need special insurances that can be purchased. Depending on the agency, there may be additional fees for crossing state lines as well., Some rental car contracts give you the option of returning the car without a full tank of gas, but you will be charged extra. Try to find a gas station a few miles from the drop off location. But be aware that the gas stations that are closest to the rental location will likely have the highest prices.Many agencies will offer to allow you to pay for the final fill-up upfront, but this is often a bad deal, money-wise, despite the convenience.

, Do not leave any trash behind for the agency to clean out, or you will be charged. Make sure you check both the front and back seats thoroughly and remove all of your possessions before you leave the car.Check under all the seats for any items that might have rolled under there.

, Do not be late; some agencies will charge you for another full day if you bring the car back even 30 minutes later than you said you would. Check with the agency beforehand to find out their exact policy on late returns.Also be aware that some agencies will even charge a fee for returning the car too early. Once again, it's best to ask for their policy regarding this sometime before the time comes to return the car.

, If you want to pay with a different card or with cash, make sure they take the charge off the card you initially used.

Place jack stands under the frame on each side behind the control arms, and lower the truck slowly. Make sure that it is supported securely by the jack stands.
, Remove the lug nuts on the front tires and remove the tires. If the wheel is stuck to the hub, give the top of the tire a swift kick with your heel to free it., Remove the caliper-mounting bracket with a 22mm socket, and place the caliper assembly away from the work area, being sure not to stress the brake line.  If you have zip ties, you can zip tie it to the upper control arm to keep it safely out of the way., Using a 6mm allen-key, to remove the bolts holding the cap on. If you are having trouble preventing the rotor from turning while loosening the bolts, interweave a pry bar or other bar through the lug studs, creating a lever to hold it in place. When removing the hub casing, the O-ring, which seals it can stick to the hub, if it does make sure to clean it and keep with the casing., Using spreading snap ring pliers spread the ring enough to work out of its groove. Use a flat head screwdriver as well as the pliers to gently work the ring off the spindle. Be careful not to over stretch, bend, or break the ring if you intend on reusing it. They aren’t too expensive if you need to replace them., After the snap ring has been removed the cam assembly should slide off exposing the lock washer. Remove the two screws holding the lock washer to the lock nut. If the grease is causing it to stick to the lock washer, wiggle it free using a screwdriver or punch., Tap the lock nut counterclockwise with a hammer and punch. Place the punch in a non-threaded hole in the lock nut, and tap the punch with a hammer to rotate it counterclockwise. Once loosened, hold the rotor in place and remove the lock nut., With the locknut removed pull gently on the rotor, which will cause it to release the bearing. Try not to drop the bearing if you don’t plan on replacing it, and place it on a clean surface, remembering the direction the bearing fit. Clean the spindle with a rag.If you plan on repacking or replacing your bearings, this is a good time to do it. The inner bearing requires a few more steps and a seal replacement if you plan on servicing it. Properly describing the process of removing the inner bearing as well as packing the bearings with grease would require it’s own set of instructions, which can be found at Florida Xtreme Xterra
, Remove the six bolts securing the rotor to the hub assembly. Using a 3/8” socket extension tap the rotor loose from behind the assembly., Clean the new rotor with brake parts cleaner and bolt it to the hub assembly. Apply a coat of grease to the spindle and slide the rotor and hub assembly in place over the spindle., Place the outer bearing back in its place, and press it in making sure it is seated and hold the bearing and rotor in place. Thread on the lock nut until it is hand tight. Lightly tap the lock nut clockwise, with a hammer and punch, using a non-threaded hole in the nut. Tap gently, being sure not to over tighten the nut, but also making sure it is secure. Spin the rotor a few times in both directions by hand, then loosen the locknut slightly and tighten again, following the instructions in step 7 for loosening and previously mentioned in this step for tightening. This will ensure that the bearings and lock nut are seated correctly., Install the lock washer over the lock nut and tighten its two screws. Slide the cam assembly over the spindle and twist making sure it seats completely, exposing the inner groove for the snap ring. Using the snap ring pliers and flat head screwdriver, slide the snap ring in place making sure it seats completely in its groove., Remove the caliper sliding pin bolts and separate the caliper from its mounting bracket. Remove the slide pins and boots and wipe them clean. Lube the slide pins with grease specially formulated for brake slide pins, and reinstall pins and boots., Tap the old pads out of the caliper with a hammer and 3/8” socket extension. Compress the piston into the caliper using a C-clamp or other clamp available. Compress the piston all the way to make room for the new, thicker, pads to fit over the rotor., Match the new pads with the old pads to make sure you are installing the pads in the right place. Bolt the caliper-mounting bracket back in place. Press the pads in place in the caliper. Slip the caliper in the mounting bracket over the rotor, and bolt it to the bracket with the sliding pin bolts., Place the wheel and tire back in place over the lug studs, and hand tighten the lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts and lower the truck."

Add one full container of fuel efficiency booster (such as STP Fuel Boost or the like which you can purchase at any superstore supermarket carrying automotive supplies).,
Change the air filter every 20,000 milesthough city-driven Sentras will need closer an air filter change about every 15,000 miles.,
Change the car's engine oil every 7,500 miles.,
Run through a checklist removing unnecessary items from the car at the very least by the summer months, if you can get away with it.,
Don't overfill and top-off the fuel tank upon fueling the Sentra.,
Don't let the Sentra vehicle run below a quarter tank of gas.,
Make sure your tires are properly inflated to their proper pressure.,
Try your hardest to not use your air conditioner in city traffic.,
Use cruise control (if your Sentra is equipped with it, as on some older models this was still an optional feature (though most people tend to think it's standard on all Sentras)).,
Avoid city streets unless there is no way of avoiding them.,
Ease yourself on the gas pedal.,
Don't try not to idle your Sentra.",How to Improve the Gas Mileage on a Nissan Sentra," Utilize the scheduled mileage chart as written on the bottles. Most ask for a new one to be added about every 4000 miles, but some may be anywhere from 4500miles to 6000miles, while some may ask for theirs to be added more regularly such as at every fill up so read the directions on the bottle carefully to ensure you aren't adding too much to your tank too quickly.


Most fuel efficiency boosters require that your tank be completely full or very close to full when you add so that the booster liquid can seep into the sides of the fuel tank and thereby clean the sides providing for a cleaner tank which can send the fuel up to where it has to go quicker, thereby producing less lag time and you'll earn a little more fuel efficiency mileage.
Be careful not to pick up a fuel booster that is designed to be a carburetor cleaner. The Nissan Sentra doesn't have a carburetor in it, and adding one that has that in it can be a complete disaster and can break your gas tank along with your engine.;
, The air filter can be a great savior. Cleaner air will allow the fuel to flow farther into the right place at the right time. Leaves, dust and other air contaminants clog up the filter instead as they pass around the gas tank completely. You'll find this air filter container underneath the front hood (most are going to be on the right hand side of the hood, but each brand year is different and is shaped differently), so check your owners manual for details on where yours is completely at before replacing something that isn't this filter and wondering ""was it right?"" or ""Is this it?"".

, Older Sentra's may require more routine mileage than 7,500 miles (12,000 km), so only use this mileage as a general guideline. It may sound weird, but if you change it when you are supposed to, this should help. Lightening the load of old oil can help decrease the amount of stored oil and thereby lighten the load of fuel needed to be moved during a given period of time, thereby increasing the fuel efficiency of the car. (You'd be sluggish too and not want to move too fast if you had too much to drink, so why test your car's ability when it's got too much oil too.)

, Heavy coats and heavy containers in the trunk may cause the fuel to increase due to the unnecessary heavier workload they'll have to carry when they shouldn't need to. Check through your backseat and remove any old items you may not need or have any use for anymore.

, As is advised in the owners manual, the more fuel it's got, the heavier the car will be (even hairs heavier). For most Sentras of 2009 model year and newer, the average size of the gas tank will be about 14 gallons, but be sure to check your owners manual for exact details or fill the tank till the gasoline pump clicks off and don't fill any further after that (regardless of price).

, Letting it get that low could put unneeded stress on the fuel pump which can decrease the fuel efficiency rating.


Buy fuel from better known companies. Although those few cents savings can seem great, cheaper gas prices from lesser-known (""mom and pop"") sellers who may not seem that worthy of your money, may end up costing you more in the long run, as these fuels may have different ratios of gas to additive added to their mixture when the better known ones have a more respected ratios that are up to government standards. Be wise and notice whether that deal is really the best deal out there, when driving past the gas location.

, Check your tires often and rotate them on the schedule set in your Service and Maintenance Guide. Although the Sentra's tire pressure number will differ from model year to model year, this number will be on a sticker inside the door jam (but not on the door itself).


Select tires that are narrow, if you need to purchase tires, but not too narrow. If you don't need new tires due to tread wear being good, don't worry. There will come a time when this could happen.

, Unless it is hot and leaving your windows down won't help when moving, the air conditioner will only cause the car to drag and the fuel efficiency to decrease.

, Most Sentra cars have their cruise control as buttons on or near their steering wheel, however some of the oldest Sentra cars still cruising the streets may have their cruise control on their own driving stick off the steering wheel entirely, so be sure to know where it is and how to use it if equipped with it.

, If you have the choice, use highway streets or where the streets are multi-lane without traffic lights. Drive on highway streets as opposed to city streets, if you possibly can. Try not to drive on city streets where stop and go traffic is apparent. If you can't avoid it, you may have to resort to the other Steps in this article, but this should be one of the other major things you can do for your car to improve it's rating.

, Lead-footed people (on the gas) tend to use a lot more gas than the vehicle is designed to put out. Put it down until you feel that car begin to move at a steady pace that is equal to the speed limit and don't let up on the gas pedal until you need to use the brake pedal. Make only minor adjustments as conditions warrant, between the gas pedal and brake, never pushing the car too much and never going above the set speed limit.

, This may seem to be a problem in most people's driveway, but when you see the Sentra idling at a traffic light for a long period of time, this may decrease your fuel efficiency rating. (Don't keep moving through a red traffic light, but avoid letting it sit idly on the highway.)

Use the flat-blade screwdriver to remove the small plastic cap piece next to the shift knob.
Then, use the flat-blade screwdriver to press down and hold the inside of the uncapped piece and pull the shift knob back all the way.

,


The cover is attached tightly in 6 locations. There are 2 in the back corners, 2 on the sides, and 2 in the front corners by the park ""P"" symbol.
Remove it by lodging the flat-blade screwdriver between the plastic cover and rectangular area and pulling up to pop the cover out of place. The cover is easiest to remove by popping out the front corners located by the park ""P"" symbol and one of the sides. Once at least 3 locations are out of place, the cover can be removed by just pulling it with some force.

,


Unscrew the 2 screws by the front corners using the phillips screwdriver and use the long-nose pliers to remove the screws without them falling into the wiring section. If the screws do fall into the wiring section, refer to Tips at the end of the article.

,

Do this using the flat-blade screwdriver and lodging it in the seam until it is well underneath the tray and pushing the tray out from underneath as shown in the image below.







,


Find the 2 screws in the back that need to be removed which are circled in the image above. Use the phillips screwdriver and the long-nose pliers to remove the 2 screws.
Then, use your hand to grip the 2 sectioned compartment and pull to pop it out of place.

,


Remove the wire connected to the power outlet by pressing down on the button on the back of the wire and pulling.
Now, the 2 sectioned compartment can be set aside in order to remove the next compartment, which is the largest one.
Next, remove the 2 screws at the bottom corners of the large compartment which are circled in the image above. Use the phillips screwdriver and the long-nose pliers to remove the screws.

In order to remove the large compartment, press down and hold at the bottom of the large compartment door in order to reveal the seam between the top of the compartment and the bottom of the stereo.
Lodge the flat-blade screwdriver in the seam and push the screwdriver away from you while using your other hand and gripping the bottom of the compartment and popping it out of place. The compartment has to pop out of place towards you; therefore, you should pull with your hand from underneath and push away with the screwdriver in order to have this affect.
Once the compartment is out of place, pull it out of the area by making sure the compartment door is closed and the bottom of the compartment is removed first. After the compartment is removed, you have access to the wiring of the stereo.







,


Attach the auxiliary box to the side of the centered compartments by the passenger seat using Command adhesive products.
Also, place the auxiliary box someplace low and a little towards the back in order for the wire to have enough length to reach the wiring section underneath the stereo.

,


Open and empty out the glove compartment.
Then, push in the flexible sides of the open glove compartment so that it slides off the corner hooks holding it open.
Once doing so, the glove compartment will be open all the way and touch the mats. This will allow you to have access behind the glove compartment in order to pass the wire behind the glove compartment and through the hole shown in the image below.







,


Grab the wire passed through the hole and pull it through until you can see it in the wiring section underneath the stereo.
Then, connect the wire to its extension which is one of the adjacent ends of the Y cable of colorful wires.
Next, attach the opposing end of the Y cable, not the adjacent end, to the white piece underneath the stereo that can be seen if you peek into the wiring section and look up.
Use scissors and electrical tape to tape the wires of the Y cable to the wall in order to prevent the compartments to interfere with them as shown in the image below.

,


After the connection is made, turn the car radio on and press the Aux button on the stereo.
The CD-C display should appear.

,


First, close the glove compartment.
Then, put back the largest compartment and screw it in.

Place the largest compartment into place by pushing it until it clicks into place.
If it is fitting correctly it should not move and the compartment door should be working perfectly.
Screw in the 2 screws that were removed in step 7 which are at the bottom corners of the large compartment.


Next, put the 2 sectioned compartment back into place and screw it in.

Reattach the wire from step 7 to the power outlet in the 2 section compartment and push that down into place.
Screw in the 2 screws from step 6 which are in the back of the 2 sectioned compartment.
Place the rubber tray back into place by just pushing it down.


Screw in the final 2 screws and place the plastic cover.

Screw in the final 2 screws from step 4 which are the corners of where the park ""P"" symbol is.
Place the plastic cover into place surrounding the shift knob.


Finally, put the shift knob back into park ""P"" and cap the small piece next to park ""P"".

The 1999 Honda CRV uses an oil filter with the part number 7317.,
Lower the vehicle.

,
Add the new oil.,
Put back the oil cap.,
Start the car.,
Restart the oil light.",How to Change Your Oil in a 1999 Honda CRV,"


There are many ways you can jack up/hoist your car. The three most common ways to hoist/jack up your car is with a two-post hoist, hydraulic floor jack, and ramps.
If you are using the two-post hoist, you can drive your car in between the two posts and then position the hoist legs onto the pinch welds of your vehicle or the designated hoisting points. (You can find the designated hoisting points in your owner’s manual). Make sure the car is in neutral in case you need to move it back or forward to get the hoist legs positioned properly.
If you are not fortunate to have a two-post jack, you are not out of luck. You can use a hydraulic floor jack or ramps. When jacking up your car with a hydraulic floor jack, you will position the hydraulic floor jack directly under the pinch welds. CAUTION: ALWAYS USE SAFETY STANDS when lifting your vehicle with a hydraulic floor jack so it doesn’t slip of the pinch welds. When using ramps, just drive your vehicle up the ramps and make sure your put it in park and place a piece of wood or metal pipe behind the rear wheels so it doesn’t roll.;
,


Tools needed to do an oil change on a 1999 Honda CRV are going to be; 17mil combination wrench or 17mil box end wrench doesn’t really matter, oil catcher, rags, oil filter remover tool, new oil filter #7317, and 4 liters of 5W-30 oil. WARNING ALWAYS GET THE SAME OIL AND OIL FILTER.

,


Open the cars hood, and locate the oil cap. The oil cap is usually black in color, has a symbol of an oil canister, and usually has what type of oil the car requires.
Once you locate the oil cap remove it. Removing the oil cap will make the oil flow out of the oil pan more smoothly because there is no pressure build up.

,


Once you lift the car up, you will locate the oil pan. The oil pan is usually flat with a plug coming out of it toward the bottom. One way of telling which is the oil pan and which isn’t is the oil pan is usually hot to the touch.

,


Before you can remove the oil plug make sure you have the oil catcher underneath the oil pan. Once you have the oil catcher underneath the oil pan, remove the oil plug with the 17mil combination or box-end wrench. To remove the oil pan bolt you are going to turn the combination wrench to the left. Once you have it loosened, you can loosen it the remainder of the way with your fingers.

,


Once the old used oil has been completely drained out of the oil pan, you will re-install the oil plug. You will start the oil plug by hand until it doesn’t turn anymore, then you get the 17mil combination wrench and tighten it to the right but not to tight because you will begin to strip the threads of the oil pan causing it to leak in the future.

,


The oil filter is usually located near the oil pan or above it. The oil filter is usually white in color unless it is on a Toyota it will have a black protector cover on it. To remove the oil filter on the 1999 Honda CRV you can use your hands, but if it is too tight you can use the oil filter remover tool. Just like the oil plug you will loosen the filter to the left.

, Before installing it dip your finger into the oil and spread the oil onto the new oil filter seal. Also before installing the new oil filter make sure the old seal from the old oil filter is not stuck there. If the old seal is stuck there just remove it and install the new filter by hand. The reason why you tighten it by hand instead of using a tool is because it will get tighter from the heat.

,,


Add the specific oil your car needs. To know which oil your car needs you can find it in the owner’s manual with how much oil is needed for you car. For the 1999 Honda CRV it takes 4 liters of 5W 30 oil but its ok if you go a little over 4 Liters. If your cars oil looks very dark black in color you can add an additive called Lucas oil stabilizer.

,


Put the oil cap back where you took it off from. Some oil caps make a ""clicking"" sound to let you know when it has been tightened all the way.

,


Before you check the oil level you are going to have to start the car for around one minute to get the oil into the engine. Once you started the car for one minute turn it off and check the oil level if it is good don’t add any more oil, but if it below the full line add some oil.

,


On the 1999 Honda CRV restarting the oil light is very simple. The oil reset switch is located right in front of the speedometer. To reset it push the reset button and it.

Gather the tools required to complete the compression test.,
Once all tools are gathered, find a place in which you would be performing the compression test, driveway, garage, etc.,
Once vehicle has reached operational temperature shut the engine off, and open up the hood of the car, Use caution as to motor will be warm and certain components could burn skin on contact, Such as exhaust manifold.,Remove all of the spark plugs from the engine

,
Disconnect the primary wires from the distributor and make sure the main harness coming from the distributor is disconnected from the motor.,
Install the compression gauge in the number one spark plug hole.,
Crank the engine over at least six compression strokes.,
Record what the gauge reads and proceed this for each cylinder head/ spark plug hole.

,
Once finished with all four readings compare the readouts with each cylinder.,If the compression is high, the combustion chambers are probably built up with carbon deposits, if the case, then the cylinder head needs to be removed and de-carbonized

,
If the compression is lower, or varies greatly between cylinders, perform a leak down test, or have a shop perform one.,
Once test is finished, make sure you screw all four spark plugs back in, and hook up the distributor harness back to the engine.",How to Check Compression on a First Generation Mitsubishi Eclipse," You will need a ratchet, spark plug socket, and a compression tester which you can easily rent from any auto parts store. You will also need some sort of repair manual, Haynes, Etc.;
, As well as the vehicle in which you would be doing the test on. Once you obtain the place and all the tools, and the vehicle, let the vehicle get up to operational temperature. NOTE: You do not want to do a compression test on a cold engine, metal expands when hot and allows everything to fully operate. This way all the parts expand on heat and keep a better compression.

, Once the hood of the car is open locate the spark plugs. There will be four of them since this is a 4 cylinder motor, and all four of them will be sitting on top of the vale cover

,, NOTE- Doing this will eliminate shock when doing test!

, Make sure the gauge can rest somewhere safe where it will not fall while you are cranking the car.

, Make sure you have a (WOT) "" throttle should be wide open"". You should be able to count how many times the motor tries to turn over. This is known as compression strokes. Once you let it turn over, turn the key off and check the gauge.

,, The readings should be no more or less than 20% of the others. The readings should be anywhere from 155+ across the board, depending on mileage.

,, This will show exactly where leaking is occurring and how bad it is.

, Double check everything is plugged back in before you attempt to start the vehicle!

, This will be on the left hand side of the engine bay if you stand in front of the vehicle., There will be six clips in total, three on the left hand side of the housing, which lift up and away, and three on the right hand side, which are designed differently but open in the same fashion., It comes directly after the air filter housing in the large diameter pipe leading from the housing to the rear of the engine. There will be a jubilee clip holding the MAF to the large air pipe. Loosen this with a Philips screwdriver., There is a large electrical connector on the right hand side of the MAF. Disconnect this by pushing in both tabs on the connector and pulling it off. It may be tight so use appropriate force to slide it off. Once this is done, release the two clips holding the MAF to the large air pipe. One clip is on top, the other is on the bottom of the MAF., First pull away the top section of the air filter box and place it to the side. Then pull the MAF away from the air pipe. Inspect the pipe leading to the rear of the engine for any obvious cracks or breakages. If you find any, replace the pipe because these air leaks will completely negate any effect your new MAF will have on engine performance., Use a good quality part, preferably from Mercedes-Benz, otherwise the best quality aftermarket part you can find. This is essential for keeping the MAF clean and allowing it to do its job effectively for longer., Installation is the exact reverse of removal. Make sure everything sits together tightly because as said before, any air leaks will make performance suffer., This process is quick, easy, and will set your new MAF up for use. Put your key in the ignition and turn it to position 2 (position 3 will start the car, do not start the car yet!). Make sure all electrical consumers such as radio, lights, heaters etc are switched off for the duration of the soft reset. With the key turned to position 2, press the accelerator pedal down to the floor and hold it there for at least ten seconds. Then, keeping the pedal down, turn the key to position zero, but do not remove the key. Once the key is in position zero, remove your foot from the gas pedal and wait for at least two minutes. Now remove the key from the ignition, put it back in and start your car., Your car will feel like new: instant acceleration, smooth power delivery, smooth gear changes. If your car previously had a CEL showing, it will clear after 30 minutes of continuous driving with the new MAF sensor."

Congratulations!",How to Change a Mercedes Battery," On many Mercedes-Benz vehicles, the battery location ranges from under the hood to in the trunk, under the rear seat (W210) or under the front passenger seat (w164/166/151). On the G-wagen (W461/463), the battery is under a cover in the floor board behind the center console. Most vehicles with the battery in the trunk will have a sticker under the hood stating ""battery in trunk"".

For vehicles with two batteries, the systems battery will be in the trunk. The starter battery will be under the hood. For starting issues, you will want to replace the battery under the hood. It will be a smaller white battery.;
,

A good battery will read 12.1-12.9 volts when the vehicle is off. A Mercedes-Benz vehicle needs a minimum of 11.4 volts to properly operate the onboard control units.

, Once the condition of the battery is determined and you have acquired a replacement, double check the amp hours (Ah) and cold cranking amps (CCA) on the battery sticker to be sure of the proper replacement. Part numbers on said sticker may differ if the original battery is older.,

On vehicles with exposed batteries (under the hood), a 10mm wrench or socket is required to remove battery cables and battery top mounts. A 13mm socket and extension are required to remove battery bottom mounts. Additionally you may need to remove the cabin air filter box. There are three snap clips on top that hold it to the firewall. use a screwdriver and pop them upward and removed air filter box. Although some batteries may seem shoehorned into their respective place, push all cables and wires to the side and lift straight up.
On vehicles with the battery in the trunk, you need to lift up the trunk floor panel and the battery should be on the right or center of the trunk under compartment. In some cases, there is a strap wrapped around the battery that can be loosened by finding the buckle, usually located on the side of the battery. On the S-Class or AMG S-class (2010 or later) there is a panel at the forward most part of the trunk that can easily come out with the removal of the trunk bottom panel. The trunk bottom panel has two T20 Torx bolts that sit inside the black plastic hooks bolted to the floor of the trunk. Once the bolts are removed and the bottom panel comes out, the forward most panel will pivot out from the left side (right side pivoting) and slide out to reveal a space between the forward-most trunk panel and the back of the seat. This is where the systems battery will be located.
On vehicles with two batteries (starter battery and systems battery), usually S-class (221) and SL class (230/231) the starter battery needs to be connected first. Therefore, if you are replacing the systems battery (in the trunk) you need to disconnect the negative battery cable from the starter battery (under the hood). Once the systems battery has been replaced you can reconnect the starter battery. A battery light may appear in the instrument cluster otherwise.

, Once the new battery is secured into the vehicle, connect the positive battery cable first. Then connect the negative battery cable.

If you connect the negative cable first then the positive, there is a chance the electricity could arc between cable and terminal which could possibly cause a control unit to short out. To reiterate, the negative battery cable comes off first and goes on last.

, Three things need to be done:

Resetting the time: On most newer vehicles the car will reset the time itself after being driven around and acquiring a satellite signal. Unless the ""time zone"" has been reset in the menu, there is no need to reset the clock manually.
Window normalization: When you disconnect the battery the windows sometimes forget where they need to start and stop. To reset window normalization, simply roll the window up and hold the button for 5 seconds. There should be an audible click once the window has relearned its position.
ESP: On all newer vehicles and most older ones, the ESP light will illuminate if the steering angle sensor has lost its positioning. To turn the light off, start the engine and turn the steering wheel from lock to lock until the yellow triangle (ESP light) on the instrument cluster is gone.

, You have successfully replaced the battery in your Mercedes-Benz!"

When you are satisfied  that it all works, screw down the motor assembly and lower the top cap back on.",How to Service the Folding Mechanism of JDM Subaru Power Mirrors," How to Replace a Car's Side View Mirror covers that part of the process.
, This is best done with automotive trim and panel tools. The thinner the better., Poke it in so it is standing vertical  and creating a gap between the glass and the plastic. Take another thin tool and start working around the edge gently applying pressure and getting the glass out from under the small lip of the plastic. Do not pry the glass upward as you will most likely break it.

, Once you have made enough space for one of your tools to slide in horizontally you will be able to feel some double sided foam tape. Push your tool into it to cut it. There are only two small patches of tape. Continue around the glass until you can cut the other piece of foam tape. You should be able to slide the glass out now.

, The connectors just slide off. Now you can put the glass to the side.

, There is a small screw underneath it and the the main pivot joint.


Now you can pull up gently on the backing plate and separate it from the tilt mechanism.







, Start by taking the foam gasket off. It will mostly likely be stuck on there pretty good. Use a hair dryer to heat it up a bit and carefully take it off. You will see a little channel where the main wire sits.

, The connector on the end of the main wire is too large to be fed through the hole in the base so each wire must be taken out of it. You can use a micro screw driver to press down on each pin and pull it out. Make sure to take a picture of how the wires were before doing this.

, Once these have been removed you can pull the wire through and separate the base fro the main motor housing.

, It will just pop off. The white tilt motor has 4 screws that hold it down. Remove these screws and slide the whole motor assembly out.

, The part that controls the folding function is contained in the black housing. Simply pry the clips up and start lifting it off. It may be sealed with some RTV so it may be stuck on there. The wires coming out of the top of the black housing also have some gasket maker plugging the hole. If the cap doesn't slide up just poke this stuff out.

, It is the silver cylinder. To access the gears there will be two screws that need to be removed. Once those are out you can slide the motor assembly up and rotate it out of the way., Try to clean this all out the best you can and use some synthetic grease. Don't pack a ton in there, just you a small amount.

The basic operation of this is fairly simple. You can spin the vertical screw which turns the gear which is attached to a worm gear which rotates the base. Go ahead and manually try to spin everything. If it binds there is some dirt or something in there.
The second cause for your mirrors not work is that the gears have bound up causing the vertical  screw to come off the motor. The vertical screw is key to fit onto the motor.

, Or you could probably hook it up to another power source. Put the vertical screw onto the motor and then lower it back down so it contacts the main gear. Just hold it in place and give it some power. The mounting plate should spin, unless your motor has somehow been damaged. The key thing is to make sure the vertical  screw is seated properly on the motor and is contacting the main gear., Since it was sealed with some RTV like stuff from the factory beforehand, you can do the same now."

Understand how the Subaru CVT transmission works.,
Keep in mind that the long-term effects of downshifting on a CVT transmission are unknown.,
Know how to get out of manual mode.",How to Use Paddle Shifters on a Subaru Outback1," An automatic transmission changes gear ratios as the car moves (so you don't have to change them manually). While most automatic transmissions have a defined set of gear ranges, a CVT automatic transmission changes seamlessly through an infinite number of gear ratios.


The Outback can simulate a manual transmission with six programmed speeds that hold the CVT pulleys in fixed positions.
You can use manual mode by moving the lever to ""M"" and using the paddle shifters, or (temporarily) by using the paddle shifters while you're driving in automatic mode (select lever at the ""D"" position). When shifting to ""M"" you do not need to press the brakes or press the button on the lever.

, Since brakes are much less costly to replace than a transmission, it would be wise to only use manual shifting in situations in which safety is enhanced, such as descending on a long, steep hill or starting off in 2nd gear under slippery conditions.


Avoid downshifting in place of braking when approaching traffic lights or other frequent, daily stops. While many people may do this, Subaru technical representatives note that downshifting ""is only recommended in situations where the engine braking would be needed, such as when descending a grade. Normally, a driver would have no need to engine brake when just coming to a stop at a light or stop sign. Since the transmission is not designed to handle this, it would accelerate wear on the CVT."" ,


If you move the lever into manual mode, you can return to automatic mode simply by moving the lever back to ""D"".
If you use the paddle shifters while driving with the lever in the ""D"" position, the car will return to auto mode when it senses a significant change in throttle position. You can trigger this by accelerating. Alternatively, you can shift the lever into manual mode (""M"") and right back to auto mode (""D"").

When at steady speed in full auto mode, the Subaru's CVT system keeps RPMs low for fuel efficiency; pushing down the accelerator very rapidly increases torque, but the RPMs still need to build up. Downshifting raises the RPMs so when you accelerate, you don't have to wait for the RPMs to catch up.Always check your blind spot by turning your head before changing lanes.

Wait for the car to either be cleaned up or shipped to the dealership.",How to Purchase a Toyota Prius," Prius cars are too expensive to make a minor mistake. Learn what makes this car much different from other cars on the road of the present day. Perhaps is the statement from Toyota that said that this car is the most efficient car on the road that makes your face smile to pieces, or maybe it's something else that this car has that no other car on the road has that makes you smile from ear to ear.;
, Explore your options. Although some people can afford a Toyota Prius, there are some that can't and need other options, even after test-driving the vehicle.

, See if it has the right fit for you. Most salespeople from the Toyota brand will want to strap into the car when you decide to take the test drive of the Prius. The Prius is an easy car for the dealer to lose, and they don't want you leaving the dealership lot without them inside the car (should you want to gallivant for a short drive away).


Test out the placement of the pedals and see if the distance between the pedals fits your driving style.
Have the dealer salesperson explain how the Prius manages its gas with its gas-electric engine from the Energy Consumption screen when stopped at a traffic light. They either may do it without even asking, or you may need to prompt them to remind them that it's one of those things all dealers should discuss during the test drive.

, If you are currently driving a certified used pre-owned Prius, get to know the specs of miles per gallon differences in city/town driving.

, If you feel the car can easily adapt to become your new car, discuss the terms of payment with the dealer salesperson. Recognize that buying a Prius is a long-term commitment you must make, and a transition that can be tough to adapt to (unless you are ""rolling in money"").

, Plan on leasing the car, if you don't have the complete full amount due upon signing. Look for alternative payment options, along with selling your current car on a trade-in book value (every little bit helps).

, Leasing the car may make the bank own the car, but you'll be able to keep it in your driveway (as long as you can make the payments) during the time. Don't forget about the taxes on each payment of the lease.

, Give the Toyota salesman your name and address, and all payment details. Specify which color car you want, along with the customization packages you want to include in the car's purchase (as this may increase the value of price, but add to the usable amount of stuff your Prius can do for you in the end).

, If they say that you can take the Prius when you walk out, good. Most times (especially for those new Priuses), they'll have to locate the customizations you've ordered on the order form, along with the color car you chose from the sales brochure, which could take a few days to a week or two, but it's waiting time well spent to get the right fit for your car.

, Depending on conditions of pre-owned or new, this can increase the time waiting for the car to be shipped to your dealer.

Drive your Prius, much like the way you would drive any other car.,
Look at the type of maneuver you'll need to complete, in order to park your vehicle.,
Determine if the space is big enough to park your vehicle.,
Recognize whether there are any obstacles you must avoid in your driving path.,
Look at what type of grade your car is in.,
Turn on your turn signal in the direction of the spot you wish to park in.,
Activate and use the Intelligent ParkAssist feature.,
Use the knowledge you obtained from a Driver's Ed class in school, or use time spent parking other cars.,
Utilize all three mirrors on your car if you are forced to back into a spot.,
Finish up your maneuver.

",How to Park a Toyota Prius," Turn on your turn signal when you are ready to park.;
, Will this parking space best be suited to need to be parallel-parked or does your Prius need to be parked in a parking space in a parking lot?

, Mentally ask yourself: Is the space big enough to accommodate your vehicle? The Prius is considered to be the same size as a midsize-car, but can be a little weird to judge if you just bought the car recently.

, Look for snow, rain, hail/sleet and puddles of water. These may force you to stop or slow your speed sooner than normal into a space.

, Downgrades or upgrade hills can cause you to find other places to park. Use the car's parking brake if you feel that the car might roll away from its parking space later.

, Do this if you come up from behind the spot at no more than five miles per hour.

, Do this if you are trying to parallel park the vehicle. Unless you are more accurate than your vehicle's sensors, try allowing Intelligent ParkAssist to help you parallel park your Prius.

, Use this when parking the Prius the ""old fashioned way"". The Prius is an automatic hybridized transmission-styled (CV) automobile, and all steps that apply with other cars, apply with the Prius.

, Backing into a spot is tricky, and with the price of the Prius being as high or more as it is, you want to avoid disfiguring and breaking your car's bumper system.

,
For driver's side bulb, remove the fuse box cover by first pressing on the front side (press toward back and lift up), no need to monkey it off one side at a time by pressing anything that looks like a latch (that's a good way to break the tabs).,
For passenger side bulb, remove plastic cover (dust cover in front) under hood of your Prius.,
If bad bulb is on Passenger side: remove small air duct blocking headlight.,
Remove waterproof cover by turning ~30 degrees.,
Remove electrical connection to bulb by standing at the driver's side fender, face forward with your right hip on the side of the fender.,
On the hard plastic holder mark the position of the square raised bump on the boot (use a piece of tape).,
When the boot is loose from the rim slide your flat hand under it (palm to the front of the car) and wiggle it off the plug end of the lamp.,
To take the old bulb out use the mirror to inspect the wire bail bulb holder.,
Look in the front of the headlight and note the flat side of the hole that corresponds to the flat metal base on the bulb.

,
It may be useful at this point to practice putting in the old bulb and fastening the wire retaining bale/spring/wire.

,, Find a mirror on a stick and a flashlight. It helps if the car is not in the sun to cut down on deep shadows. Almost everything you will be working with is black.

,, It will loosen and come off. Use the cover to hold the tools. It is not necessary to remove the front dust cover held on with phillips fasteners.

, This can be done with a Phillips screwdriver (quarter turn to left to pop loose, then push from behind / pull up the reusable clips). If you remove the cover of the fuse box first, you can use the fuse box cover to hold the screws.

, This will require a small blade-type screwdriver to pry off re-usable plastic rivet.

, You might need a long-handled flat blade screwdriver to loosen it at first (see video below). Push cover back from headlight assembly to gain access to bulb / wiring harness.

, Reach into the car with the back of your hand facing forward so that the square white plastic removable socket for the lamp passes between your index and middle fingers. Wiggle the socket off. Do not let go until you look at the configuration/position of the holes in the socket and note them for reconnecting.

, To remove the driver's side rubber weatherproofing boot which is fitted with bump-outs to aid removal stand at the front of the car, place the shaft of a screwdriver on the side of the bump and push it toward the driver's side fender to rotate the boot about 1/16th of a turn (Clockwise when viewed from front of car looking back towards engine). If the boot does not wiggle out of the hard plastic track/housing, push to turn the boot some more.

, TIP: This is the hardest part as the fit around the bulb is tight to keep out water. So push bulb forward when you pull rubber boot backwards (otherwise you may damage metal spring and have to go to dealer) Remove and read the cover to see what is the top. Feel the 4 square bumps around the hole.

, Look for a hook that captures the wire and holds the wire under tension. Unhook the wire and swing it away. practice hooking it up again.(TIP: Drive side and Passenger side are different. Unhooks down on driver side up on passenger side)(Note:2003-2004 Prius had exactly same hook position. both side Unhooks down)

,,, This will ensure the bulb is aligned before you re-hook the retainer.

, This may be hard, especially on the Passenger side, where the body of the car blocks your view. TIP: This can be done with one hand, by holding bulb forward and swing retainer behind bulb. Then just hook metal spring over hook.

, This is very difficult to do. A mirror placed in front of the boot is a great help in getting the boot back on. Ask your helper to hold the mirror. TIP: This can be done without a mirror by pushing small hole around back of bulb. But be sure outer four tabs are aligned (one of the four is larger then the other three)

, Reconnect the electrical connection after redistributing the grease in the socket.

,,,,, The whole process takes about 1.5 hours because you can't see anything you are doing and wonder if you are doing it correctly.

, Estimates from $100 to $600. A 61 year old woman with little experience and stiff fingers just did this on the drivers side in less than 30 minutes -- two beers for me!

Make sure to have your car inspected every year in states that have inspection laws.",How to Get the Best Gas Mileage from Your Toyota Prius," Try to take routes that have long stretches with few stops with speed limits of at least 30–35 mph (48–56 km/h).


At speeds less than 45 mph (72 km/h), when you reach speed, remove your foot from the accelerator pedal, this turns off the gasoline engine. Slowly depress the accelerator pedal to maintain your speed while keeping the indicator below the ECO line.;
, The Prius is streamlined for head-on gusts and tail-winds.

,, A Prius will get its poorest gas mileage until it has warmed up several minutes after starting it.,, The air is less dense and will produce less air resistance.

, It's torturous with any car, and with the Prius, all the stops and starts to waste gas.

,, Try to maintain this pressure, plus 2 PSI at all times. Never use the pressure stated on the tire sidewall, as this is a maximum inflation pressure for the tire, without consideration to what type of car it is mounted on!

, For the 2014 Prius you should use 87 octane rating or higher.

, Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as you know you'll need to to slow down or stop. Put your car into ""Glide"" mode under these circumstances.


Create space between your car and the car in front of you, to give yourself time to stop and coast.

, This alone will show you the direction of what part of your car's system is powering the other. Monitor it.


Drivers get the best mileage when they are able to read changes in the display. By pressing on the accelerator and brakes to move energy from the gasoline engine to the wheels and/or batteries-or to get all the arrows to disappear. This form is called glide mode.

, In other conditions, accelerate quickly until at speed then maintain your desired speed.


Lift your foot slightly and reapply your foot after a few seconds until the Energy display shows energy going to the wheels and battery. This is an especially critical tool to use when you find you need energy (such as at night with the battery at a low charge).







, The battery power will assist the engine, thereby reducing your gas use.

,


For every mph over 55 mph (89 km/h), you loose approximately one mpg.

,,, Use the vent system along with the fan's temperature to properly control the vehicle's temperature. Try not to use the ""Max"" setting, at all costs. Turn off the heating, cooling, lights and all other electric accessories, as much as possible.


On hot days, set the air conditioning two degrees lower than the outside temperature, or to 85 (whichever is lower).
On cold days, once the cabin is at a comfortable temperature, turn off the climate control. At highway speeds it will maintain that temperature purely by the air rushing into the car's interior.

, It works well on flat roads, and is excellent on non-congested higher-speed highways.


Cruise control is not good in hilly terrain, or where uphills produce aggressive driving and too much regenerative braking on downhills. Give the car a little push on the accelerator when you disengage regenerative braking.

, The Prius does a good job stopping quickly, coast more than stop whenever possible, thereby decreasing the amount of gas you use. Follow road signs, but hold off on braking until the last few moments.


Just like you learned when you first learned to drive an automatic car: Never, under any circumstances, keep your foot on the brake and accelerator pedal at the same time.

,,,,,, Don't put the ""pedal-to-the-metal"" the second the light changes from red to green, or when entering the freeway and/or passing that slow car in your lane.

,, Keep your car tuned, engine and transmission fluids at the proper level, and all other areas cleaned (inside and out).

,,,,,, Disassemble and pack all four c v joints with molybdenum disulphide lithium grease. Rotate the c v joints by installing the previous wheel c v joint to the inside transmission flanges, and installing the previous transmission c v joints to the outside wheel flanges.

, Coat brake line in this area with Rustoleum or lead-base primer and paint.

, Apply the brakes and have an assistant outside try to rotate the front left and right wheels. If one (or both) front wheel still rotates when the brakes are applied, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder or caliper, master cylinder, rubber grommet on Master cylinder where brake fluid enters for cracking or leakage, or brake shoes and linings. Apply (with force) and release brake and then check again for free rotation of front wheels. If one (or both) front wheels do not rotate freely, check for faulty brake hose, brake cylinder of caliper. NOTE: brake hose deteriorates from the inside and may look perfectly good on the outside.

,, It assures the engine is not overstressed (lugged down,) and will not overheat due to faulty brakes. The engine will last longer and the car will get better gas mileage.

, Therefore, the brake procedure should also be performed when: the gas mileage drops; the car does not roll freely (coast) on the road, especially after releasing brakes; a wheel drum overheats, or smelling of burning brake shoes.

If you don't hear any engine noise, this is because the car is running on electricity only.

, You can use your rear-windshield wiper to clear off any items that may be impeding your view. You can also manually clear off any precipitation that may be impeding your view. You may leave the wiper on, if you feel you need it to continue your journey.

, Look specifically for the gas amount and temperature controls. Although the gas will tend to not be so much of a factor, the car does run for a short time on gas. Temperature ranges are read just like any other car.

, The car will give you a readout in digital form. Despite popular demand of what most cars give you, Toyota thought they'd make it easier on their customers to give them a more-enjoyable and more easily-read readout.

, The turn signal is on the left stalk in the car.).

, If it's already disengaged, skip this step. This is done by pushing in the pedal furthest to the left which is marked ""Push On Off"".

,,, Recognize that there is no Park position on the gearshift itself. Instead, you can use the Neutral (N) position.

, Make sure the car is in the drive position and not in the overdrive mode. Look at the joystick-like shifter to the right of the button that powers the car to an on position.


When the car is in P mode, your dashboard will light up the P mode light (it will place a square around the letter P to the left of the digital speedometer. This selector is positioned in the middle right area of the gear selection knob where there is a large filled dot. This mode is much similar to the Park position on a Automatic Transmission car.
Shift into R mode when you need to reverse the car. However, shifting into R mode will trigger to turn on the rear camera on the vehicle. If you enable the feature by pressing the button, R mode will be the first mode you'll need to shift into to begin a ParkAssist maneuver with your Prius. R mode runs the same way as Reverse does in an another automatic transmission car. This mode is positioned at the top left of the shift column from the shift lever.
Use the N mode when you need to use the Neutral gear. Shifting into this gear on a flat slope will cause your car not to move anyplace, however on a downward slope the car will start to roll forward without any gas applied. N mode is straight across from P and must be shifted into each and every time to get it out of park and into a drivable gear.
Use the D mode when you want to drive the vehicle. D mode operates the same way shifting an automatic into Drive does. D mode is in the bottom left corner of the shifting column.
Use B mode occasionally. The B mode (shown on the gear lever) can also be used to make the car move forwards. When B mode is activated, engine braking is much more pronounced. It can be found immediately under P mode, and you shouldn't need to shift it into any other gear on the left to operate this mode.

Re-engage the reverse beep.",How to Disable Reverse Beep in a Toyota Prius1," Prius cars made from 2004 to 2009, called ""Generation 2,"" have a combination of in-car commands you can utilize to disable the reverse beeping, but the vehicle must be started in order to do so. Start a Toyota Prius by inserting the key into the ignition. Unlike a normal vehicle, you will not need to turn the key. Instead, press your foot firmly on the brake and hit the start button to the driver’s right.The Prius is extremely quiet, so pay attention to the instrumentation to know if it is running.
Some newer model cars will not require that you insert the key, as long as it’s in the vehicle.;
, On the right side of the steering wheel, there are a number of buttons you can use to control the settings and display of the dashboard. Press the button labeled “TRIP” until the letters “ODO” appear on the display. On some models of Prius, the button may be next to the odometer on the dashboard itself.In later generation models of the Prius, this function will not display ODO and this method will not work.
You may need to press the button more than once to make it display the letters “ODO.”
Turn the vehicle off the letters “ODO” appear.

, Wait a second, then restart the car in the same manner as before. Turning the vehicle off and then on again is an important part of the series of commands that indicates to the computer that you wish to turn the backup alarm off.Be sure the engine is off before attempting to start it again.

, With the vehicle running once again, hold down the same “TRIP” button for a full ten seconds or longer. The display may change to reflect that you have held the button down on some cars, but it may not always.Count to ten to yourself before letting go of the button.
If the display changes you can let go.

, Shift the vehicle into reverse by pulling the shift lever backward out of park. Remember to keep your foot planted firmly on the brake while shifting out of park to prevent the car from moving.The reverse beep may still sound at this point.

, After you feel the transmission shift into reverse, press forward again on the shift lever to put the vehicle back into park. This is the final step in the sequence to change the reverse beep settings in the car’s computer.Turn the car off again.
The next time you start the car, the reverse beeping will be disabled.

, If you decide that you would like to turn the reverse beep back on in your Prius, you will need to repeat the process again in the exact same manner. Going through the steps each time serves to engage or disengage the reverse alarm, so completing each of these steps in the same order will reactive that alarm.If you have difficulty repeating the process, take the vehicle to your local Toyota dealership and they can reactivate the reverse alarm for you.

Purchase an OBDII Bluetooth adapter from an automotive or electronics specialty store.Some Bluetooth OBDII adapters are designed specifically for certain smart phones, so be sure to purchase one that works with yours.
Android phones may be better for this specific application.

, The OBDII port in your vehicle is located on the underside of the dashboard on the driver’s side. It may be difficult to spot, as it tends to be made of black plastic. There are multiple metal pins inside the port and there should be no others like it in the area.If you are having difficulty locating the OBDII port in your Prius, refer to the owner’s manual to assist you in locating it.

, Insert the new OBDII Bluetooth adapter into the OBDII port in your Prius. Because the adapter is wireless, it should not hang down very far. Some adapters will light up when plugged into a vehicle with the power on.Make sure the adapter is seated firmly in the port so it has a strong connection.
Press the start button without your foot on the brake to engage the car’s electrical system.

, There are a number of applications available for smart phones that can be used to read or adjust the settings in your vehicle when combined with an OBDII Bluetooth adapter. Carista, OBD Fusion and DashCommand are each options that may work for your specific smart phone.Open the application and create an account if need be.
Turn on Bluetooth on your smart phone.

, With the application of your choice running and Bluetooth enabled, the phone should automatically sync with the adapter. If it does not, try turning Bluetooth off and then on again. Ensure the vehicle has the power running, but not the engine.You may need to open settings and tell the phone to sync with the adapter.
If you have a Bluetooth password on your phone, you will need to enter it for the two to connect.

The best application for this is called ELM327 app for Android or Apple devices.There may be other options available to you for download.
Ensure the application you choose allows you to manually input lines of code to interact with the car’s computer.

, Insert the OBDII Bluetooth adaptor into the OBDII port and hit the “Start” button on the Prius without pressing the brake pedal to the floor. This will engage the vehicle’s electrical system.Be aware, modifying the code in your vehicle’s computer may cause other issues and should only be done by professionals.
Doing this may void your warranty if you have one.

, Once the application is connected to the Bluetooth adaptor, type in the series of codes required to adjust the settings on the reverse alarm. These codes serve as prompts, and the vehicle will respond with codes as well. Type the following codes into the application: Enter the command “AT SH 7c0” and the vehicle should respond, “ok.”
Type “21ac” and the response should be “61 AC 00” which represents the reverse horn setting.
Enter the code “3bac40” which will adjust the setting. You will receive two lines of code from the car indicating that you are done.

, When you type the command “21ac” again, it will prompt the computer to display the current backup horn setting. While “00” represented having the setting on, it should now read “40” which indicates that the horn will only beep once. Close the application once you have verified the new setting is in place.
Start the vehicle and test to ensure the backup horn is off.

, If the horn still beeps while the vehicle is in reverse, take it to your local Toyota Dealership. They have the tools on hand to deactivate the reverse beep without voiding your warranty or causing any further issues.The price for this service may range from $50 to $200 depending on the availability of the tools needed and the dealership itself.
This is the safest way to deactivate the backup horn.

, If you decide you'd like to turn the reverse alarm back on at any point, reconnect to the Bluetooth adapter and enter the same series of codes to adjust it back to its original setting.Enter the command “AT SH 7c0” and the vehicle should respond, “ok.”
Type “21ac” and the response should be “61 AC 40” which represents the reverse alarm being set to off.

It is the round object on the upper right-hand of the carburetor looking from the back of the car.
There is a wire coming to it from the positive side of the coil. Check this with a trouble light for voltage when the key is on.
The choke is held in position by a triangular ring clamp and three screws so it can be loosened and rotated for adjustment.

,


With the engine cold, the butterfly valve should be closed.
As the engine warms up, the coil voltage heats an element inside the automatic choke, causing a bi-metal spring to uncoil, opening the butterfly valve, and moves the cam to reduce the idle speed.

,


When cold, the little screw at the top of the throttle arm should now rest on the top step of the stepped cam.
This sets the hi-idle, which is needed together with the choke on a cold engine to provide sufficient idle speed to keep the engine running until it warms up fully.

,,


Turn the choke element clockwise until the butterfly is standing straight up. Then turn the choke counterclockwise until the choke butterfly fully closes (not too tight).

,,


As the engine warms up, make sure that the butterfly opens until it is standing fully open when the engine is fully warm.
If it doesn't fully open,put your finger briefly on the ceramic of the automatic choke and see if it is hot. If not- you need a new one. Try it again in the morning and see if it opens enough to drive it. Check that it is wide open when warm. Re-adjust until you get it right."

Compression readings should be high compression (over 100 pounds) and relatively uniform among the cylinders (within 5 pounds). Variations from cylinder to cylinder should be no more than 14 to 20 pounds.

,

If the compression reading increases a little, the problem is probably worn, broken, or poorly seated piston rings.
If the compression reading remains the same, leaking or damaged valves may be at fault.

Arrive at an early termination cost.",How to Calculate Adjusted Lease Balance," To calculate your lease balance, you will first need to calculate your lease value and monthly payments. To do, you will need some information. Contact your lender or dealer and ask for the following:


The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for the vehicle.
The sale price of your vehicle.
Any rebates or incentives provided on your lease.
The residual value of the vehicle.
The lease duration and the number of months remaining.
The money factor on your lease. This figure is similar to an interest rate, but is expressed differently.;
, Read the agreement to protect yourself against calculations errors on the funder's part or purposeful fraud. Compare each figure stated in your agreement to the information you just received from your dealer or lender. Look for early termination fees, administrative charges, and taxes, along with any resale charges or expenses. Your agreement will also specify a residual value for the vehicle, so make sure that this matches the value given to you by the lender or dealer.


An early termination charge may be assessed by the dealer in the event of lease termination. This charge may be in the form of several months' worth of lease payments and may depend on how many months of payments remain on the lease., Any unpaid or late lease payments will also be added into the cost of ending your lease. Check for these payments by checking over your lease payment history., Your monthly lease payment is the payment you have been paying throughout the life of your lease. You can find this amount on your lease bills. If you have not yet gotten the lease. You can calculate your monthly lease payment by adding the vehicle's monthly depreciation plus the monthly finance charge.


Calculate the monthly depreciation by subtracting the residual value from the capitalized cost of the vehicle. The capitalized cost of the vehicle is what the lender borrowed for the lease, which is the sale price of the vehicle minus incentives and rebates.

For example, a $40,000 car might have sold for $37,000, and then been further reduced by a $2,000 rebate to $35,000. The capitalized cost is the $35,000.


The residual value is stated in your lease agreement. Imagine for the $35,000 vehicle that the stated residual value is $20,000. The total depreciation over the life of the lease would be $35,000 (the capitalized cot) - $20,000 (residual value), or $15,000.
The monthly depreciation, assuming a 5-year lease, would then be $15,000/60 (for 60 months), or $250.
The finance charge is calculated by adding together the capitalized cost and depreciation charge and then dividing by the money factor. For example, imagine that the lease described above has a money factor of 0.00100. The monthly finance charge would then be ($35,000+$20,000)*0.00100, which is $55.
Finally, add the monthly finance charge to your monthly depreciation to get the monthly payment. In this case, this would be $55 + $250, or $305., You can work out the number of months left on your lease in several ways. First, try just asking your lender or dealer how many months of payments remain on the lease. Alternately, you can subtract the number of months you have paid from the total lease duration in months. So, if you've paid 3 years (36 months) of a 5-year (60 month) lease, you have 60-36, or 24 months remaining., Once you know how many payments you still owe, multiply that number by your monthly payment amount to get your adjusted lease balance. For example, using the example of 24 months remaining on the five-year lease with a $305 monthly payment, you would have a lease balance of 24*$305, or $7,320., Despite the simple calculation above, your actual adjusted lease balance may be different due to rent charges in your lease. These may differ from your calculations due to different calculations made as part of the actuarial method by the lender or dealer. To know your adjusted lease balance for sure, call your lender or dealer and ask for this balance., The residual value is defined in the lease agreement. It is the lender or dealer's estimated value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term. This may be somewhat higher or lower than the actual value of the vehicle in the current market when you end your lease, but is still used in determining your termination costs., The realized value is another way to measure the value of the vehicle at the time of your lease's termination. It can be defined in the lease agreement, or may be calculated through other means, including:


You or the dealer may obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of the vehicle upon lease termination.
The highest bid for the vehicle at a wholesale or retail auction.The insurance payout for a total loss in the event that the vehicle is severely damaged in a collision., Add up termination fees, charges, taxes, unpaid amounts, and resale expenses to arrive at a fee total for the lease termination. Then, add in your lease balance as calculated by you or provided by your lender. Next, add this figure to the residual value specified in your loan agreement. This number represents the money that you owe your lender before turning over the vehicle.For example, imagine you owe $2,000 in various fees and expenses, along with the loan balance of $7,320 calculated in the previous example and a residual value of $20,000. Your total at this stage would be $2,000 + $7,320 + $20,000, or $29,320.

, Your realized value is now subtracted from the previous total to arrive at your early termination cost. Keep in mind that your realized value may be lower or higher than the residual value in the lease agreement and depends on the market value of the vehicle.For example, imagine that the realized value for the car in the previous example is $28,000 at the time of lease termination.

, Your early termination cost will be what you owe the lender or dealer for ending your lease early. In the above example, this would come to $29,320 - $28,000, or $1,320.


This fee can be avoided by transferring the lease to someone else rather than terminating it."

Compare dealership offers.",How to Calculate a Lease Payment," The first is depreciation, the reduction in the value of the car over the term of the lease. The second is financing, the amount that you pay for the use of the car. It is computed on the amount the leasing company invested to purchase it. The third is sales tax, which is added to the monthly lease payment in many U.S. states and in Canada., Choose a vehicle based on the amount it will depreciate rather than the sales price of the car. Your lease payment is dependent on how much your car depreciates during the lease period. Cars depreciate at different rates, and some models lose much more of their value than others in the first few years of use. When considering an auto lease, shop for a vehicle focusing on the amount a vehicle will depreciate during the lease term rather than the initial sale value of the car.


If you are the lessor (or person who is leasing the car to someone else), you want to purchase the car that best retains its purchase price; that is, a car with a low depreciation.

, Many people know they can negotiate on the sale price of a new car but think they have to pay the advertised price for a lease. Look for special offers from dealers and lease at a time of year when they want to reduce their inventory, such as when new models are arriving in September.


Note that you can also lease used cars, especially those coming off their first lease term.

, The net capitalized cost equals your negotiated selling price minus any down payment and any other credits (such as the value of a trade-in or factory rebate). If the dealer agrees to pay off the balance of the loan on your existing car, add that loan balance to the selling price.For example, let's say the negotiated selling price of the car is $26,000. Subtract a down payment of $1,000 and a trade-in value of $3,000 = $22,000. The dealer then agrees to pay off the balance of the loan on your existing car at $5,000, so that equals a $27,000 net capitalized cost.

, The dealer may provide this number or may provide you with a residual percentage. To calculate the residual value, multiply the sticker price of the car by the residual percentage.For example, $30,000 sticker price X 55% residual percentage = $16,500 residual value.
Remember that depreciation isn't a straight line — it is usually accelerated in the first five years, particularly in the first year.Your car may depreciate by 20% or more in the first year, After the first five years, most cars have depreciated by 60% on average., Then subtract the residual value from the net capitalized cost. Divide the resulting number by the number of payments. The result is the depreciation portion of the lease payment.For example, you lease a new car for three years. The sticker price of the car is $30,000, you negotiate a purchase price of $26,000, you make a cash down payment of $1,000 and you trade in your old car for a credit of $3,000. There is no loan balance due on your current car. The dealer tells you the residual value at the end of the lease will be 55% of the sticker price.
The net capitalized cost = $26,000 - $1,000 - $3,000 = $22,000.
The residual value = $30,000 x 55% = $16,500.
The number of monthly payments = 3 years x 12 months/year = 36.
Depreciation fee = ($22,000 - $16,500) / 36 = $152.78.

, You can determine the value of the money factor in one of two ways depending on the information that is provided to you by the dealer. It might be an interest Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or a ""rent charge.""

, If the dealer provides you with the interest rate APR, divide the interest rate by 2,400. For example, if the interest rate is quoted at 6 percent, the money factor = 6 / 2,400 = 0.0025. If the dealer provides a ""rent charge"" or ""lease charge,"" add the residual value to the net capitalized cost. Then multiply that total by the number of months in the lease term. Divide the rent charge or lease charge by this number to compute the money factor.For example, if the dealer quotes a lease charge of $3,465, the money factor = $3,465 / = 0.0025.
""2400"" is the denominator after conversion of a percentage to decimals, yearly interest to monthly interest, and applying it to average principal amount outstanding during the lease.

, Multiply that total by the money factor. The result is the financing portion of your lease payment. For example, financing fee = ($22,000 + $16,500) x 0.0025 = $96.25.

, In Canada and in most states in the U.S., sales tax is applied to the monthly lease payment. In that case, multiply the lease payment (the depreciation fee + the finance fee) by the local sales tax rate. In some states, sales tax is collected at the time the lease is initiated; in such cases, no sales tax is added to the monthly payment., Add the depreciation fee, the financing fee and the monthly sales tax, where applicable. Do these calculations for every brand of vehicle you are considering for a lease.

, Once you choose a brand, compare these calculations to at least three dealerships that sell this brand. Do not negotiate the selling price separately from the trade-in value. A dealer might give you a lower selling price and then subtract that amount from what he or she would give as a trade-in value. Negotiate for one final monthly price that you can afford.

Tip the chauffeur.",How to Rent a Limousine," Early summer is the peak of the season for hiring limousines. You will probably be able to secure a better price if you hire a limo outside the months of May and June. You’re also likely to get a better rate on weekdays.Sunday through Thursday are typically the least expensive days, while Fridays are about 20% less than Saturdays. Most limousine companies have hourly minimums on Friday and Saturday nights.Events you may want to hire a limo for include airport transfers, weddings, nights out or day trips, bachelor or bachelorette parties, city or wine tours, concerts, A to B transfers, proms, client meetings and special events. Most limousine companies have special airport transfer rates and special A to B Rates.;
, Once you know what you want, call a selection of companies and obtain written quotes for your event. You can look in a local directory online or in other directories such as the yellow pages. However, a great way to find a satisfactory limo service is by word of mouth.Try asking family members, friends, or co-workers if they’ve used a limo service they were pleased with.

, Ensure the company has valid certification. Ask if they have liability insurance and professionally trained drivers. You may also want to ask if they are a member of the National Limousine Association. Find out how long the company’s been in business.Ask to see proof that the company and driver have the proper license and certification for commercial hire, with respect to local, state and federal laws.Ask if the company’s drivers undergo official criminal background checks and drug testing., Find a limo service that has a good record of customer satisfaction. Look for comments indicating that the service was friendly, professional, and showed up on time. You can also check the company’s rating with the Better Business Bureau, and whether they have record of any complaints about that company., A lot of limo companies offer special packages based on the event type. For example, a prom package might include non-alcoholic drinks, cake, and goodie bags. Ask what packages are available and what is included in each package.Carefully weigh the price and value of the package “extras.” Similar to hotel package deals for special occasions, it will probably be more cost-effective to bring extra props or food yourself rather than getting a package deal.

, You don’t want to end up with a bill that’s far higher than you expected, so gather details ahead of time. Ask if there are mileage charges, and if so, what they are. Find out if beverages (alcoholic and/or non-alcoholic) and ice cost extra. Expect to pay any applicable road tolls or parking fees.Try asking, “Does my time begin at pickup or when the limo leaves your location?”
Find out if a tip is included in the quote or separate.
Make sure to specifically ask, “Does this price cover everything?”

, Ask about a deposit: limo companies generally ask for a deposit of 20 to 50 percent down. If they’re asking for more than 50%, you should be wary and will probably want to look elsewhere.Ask how the remainder of the balance will be paid, For example, will it come off of your credit card or will it be due via cash or charge at the end of the event?

, Most limousine companies offer six-, eight-, and ten-passenger vehicles. There are also larger options such as Hummer vehicles, “extra stretch” limos or limo busses. If you’re going on a date and there will only be two of you, you may want to opt for a sedan.A standard four- to six-passenger limo runs about $60 to $65 an hour, whereas a stretch limo for six to eight people is $150 to $175 per hour.Party bus limos for fifteen to twenty passengers cost $125 to $175 per hour.
A sixteen-passenger limousine rental is about $97-$107 per hour.
A twenty-five-passenger limo bus costs about $225-$300 an hour., You’ll be more comfortable with extra room rather than filling the limo to its maximum seating capacity. People are different sizes, so as a rule of thumb you’re better off getting a limo with seating capacity for two more spots than you intend to fill.For example, if you have four people in your party, opt for a six-passenger limo.
Try to book a vehicle that has room for at least one to two last minute extra people than are in your party, just in case.

, There are various extras you may want included. For example, some limos have a TV, VCR or DVD player, a sound system, car phone, sunroof or Jacuzzi.Verify that the limo will have fully working seatbelts, as well as air conditioning or heat upon request., Ask if the color, size and make/model of the vehicle are guaranteed. It’s important to view the exact vehicle you’ll be riding in beforehand to make sure you approve of it. If the company refuses to do this, look for a different provider.Ask if the vehicle has had regular inspections and is certified as both safe and mechanically sound. For instance, the vehicles should be DOT inspected and approved.Make a note of the license plate of the vehicle you are hiring to ensure that you get the correct vehicle on the day of the event.

, Ask who specifically you should contact if you have any complaints or concerns before, during or after the limo service. Write down the contact’s name, telephone number and email address. Bring this information with you., If gratuity isn’t already included in the bill – or perhaps even if it is – don’t forget to give gratuity to the driver at the end of the event. Professional drivers often make low hourly wages, and they typically rely on tips.Give the driver 15 to 20% of the total cost of your rental. Base the amount you give on the level of service you received.

Present a debit card.,
Bring extra identification.,
Expect that they will check your credit score.,
Prepare for additional hurdles.,
Expect a hold on your account.,
Use a prepaid card, check, or money order.",How to Rent a Car Without a Credit Card1," If you don’t have a credit card, if you have a checking account, many banks and credit unions will give you a debit card. Most car rental agencies will accept a debit card instead of a credit card, but it can be a longer process.


Debit cards function almost like credit cards, except that the funds are debited (withdrawn) directly from your checking account, so you’re not really putting it “on credit.” That's why car rental companies that accept them will put you through additional hurdles to get the car.
Check logo requirements. Some rental companies will let you use a debit card to rent a car, but they may require that the debt card has the right logos. Car companies often require Visa or MasterCard logos. Check with the rental agency.Prepaid debit cards or those that aren’t linked to an actual bank account are sometimes not accepted by car rental companies. Don’t assume the company will accept the card just because it’s a debit card.;
, To save time, you may want to bring extra identification. You might need it in order to use a debit card or other non credit card method. You should assume you will be asked to prove your identity other ways.


You might be asked to show proof of auto insurance, a plane ticket itinerary or a recent utility bill if you’re not paying with a credit card. Expect to be asked to produce more than one way to verify your identity.
The name on the extra identification will need to match the name on your driver's license.
You’re probably not going to get the best cars without a credit card. Most car rental companies probably won’t let you rent a luxury car or SUV.

, Many rental car companies, such as Dollar, accept debit cards but only after they perform a credit inquiry screening through a company like Equifax. If you have very poor credit, you might not get the car.


That means they are still going to check your credit score and report, and they won’t let you rent the car with a debit card if your credit score is very poor. They want to make sure they can recoup their costs if something happens to their car.
Some companies will let you pay the bill with a debit card even if your credit score is very poor at the end of the trip. However, they will still require a credit card to reserve it in the first place.If your credit is decent, renting a car with a debit card isn’t likely to be an issue, although it will harm your credit rating a little bit when the company runs your report.

, To rent a car with a debit card, the rental car company may require additional steps. Expect to spend a little more time on the car rental process than you would with a credit card.


The company might require you to purchase insurance through the rental company.
It can take longer to pay with a debit card than with a credit card. They are going to check your credit, your insurance, and verify your identification.
Car rental companies prefer renting to people with credit cards, so they make it harder not to do so. They are likely to make you prove your identify, possibly through several methods.

, The rental car company may place a hold on your account even if they accept a debit card. Make sure you have the extra funds to cover this hold.


That’s a deposit that they hold back until you return the car. The deposit can exceed $200. When the company puts the hold on the account, it means that those funds will not be available for your use.
Holds on your card can last as many as 14 days. You will need to have enough money in your account to cover the entire cost of the rental and deposit.
Some international locations might not accept debit cards at all. Check with the credit card company to find out where debit cards are accepted. Some rental car companies only accept debit cards at some non-international locations too.

, Some car rental companies, but by no means all of them, will accept prepaid cards. You can buy these cards at many grocery and department stores.


For example, Enterprise does accept prepaid cards. Other car companies only accept prepaid cards when you return the car. You will still need a debit or credit card to rent it in the first place.Some companies (but not most) accept personal checks on return or at corporate locations. Some accept money orders (Avis is one that does). This is rarer though, so check around.
You might need to make a cash down payment in order to use a debit card at some companies.

"
"
Pay cash to rent a car.,
Prove your identity.,
Pay a cash deposit.",How to Rent a Car Without a Credit Card2," You’re going to have to check around because all companies don’t allow this, and some that do allow it will only let you pay cash when you return the car, not when you pick it up.


However, it’s possible to rent a car with cash at some independent outlets or companies that market toward that clientele.
For example Rent-A-Wreck is one company that accepts cash without a debit or credit card ever being presented.Some online sites have compiled lists of cities that have cash only locations., To use cash, expect to have to prove your identity. And you might be asked to show a lot of it. The car rental companies may want to see several items to prove who you are before giving you the car.


You may be required to show proof of insurance, a travel itinerary, and verification of your identity, such as your driver’s license.The car rental company will probably limit the type of cars that you can rent, and they won’t allow additional drivers in many cases.
Alamo cash rental rules require a current utility bill with your current address and a verifiable phone number in the renter’s name. Some major companies will let you pay for the car in cash, but you still need to present a credit or debit card to drive it away.

, You’re going to need to have some extra money lying around if you want to pay for a rental car with cash. That's because the car rental companies are likely to want some extra cash as backup.


You will often have to provide a cash deposit in addition to the rental’s cost. You might be subject to a credit check.
Alamo requires a $300 cash deposit in addition to the rental charges. Check with the specific car rental agency because rules can differ.
You will receive the cash back when you return the car without damages, often by a refund check the company will mail to you.

"
"
Use someone else’s credit card to rent the car.,
Check around.,
Break down and get a credit card.",How to Rent a Car Without a Credit Card3," Some credit card companies make you use the same card to prepay for the vehicle and pick it up, but all don’t. You could borrow a credit card from a family member and friend, and pay that person back with cash.Budget is one company that allows this. Some companies require that the person whose name is on the card and the person who picks up the rental car are one and the same.
Clearly, you should only borrow someone's card with their permission, but perhaps you have a loved one who is willing to charge the rental car to their credit card if you agree to pay them back right away.

, Not all companies allow this. You will need to find a rental car company that allows you to use one card to prepay for the vehicle and other identification to pick up the car. Family-owned or lower-end rental companies, such as those specializing in used cars that aren’t that great, might have more relaxed rules.Don’t assume that all car rental companies are the same. Call around, and check on their requirements.You might be able to find an independent car rental company that will accept cash or someone else’s card. The big name chain companies are less likely to do so., Some people qualify for a credit card, but they don’t want to accrue credit card debt. If you are planning on renting a car, it would make your life a lot easier to break down and get one.


You could always set aside the cash to immediately pay the card off. Most car rental companies are still going to make you present them with some plastic, whether a debit card or a credit car, in order to drive the car away from the lot in the first place.
Look at it through their eyes. You’re asking to drive a very expensive machine that they own away from their lot, and they want to make sure you’ll bring it back (and that they know who you are if you don’t).
Improve your credit score. Maybe your problem is a low credit score, or maybe you have a debit card but can’t rent a car because you have a low score. Pay off your accounts, and make sure not to run them up to the limit.

Practice.",How to Identify Cars,"

You can probably already identify the make and model of cars you have driven. Practice spotting others like yours on the road.
Choose a particular type of cars that interest you and try those next. If you happen to be a Mustang fan, you could start with those.
Choose a nationality or region to specialize in. Admire German engineering for a while, if you like.



 


Focus on a particular class or category of cars. If you have more fun spotting sports cars than minivans, start there.
Once you have mastered one category to your satisfaction, branch out to another.;
, Does it have an unusual shape to the grill or tail lights? For classic cars, tune in to things like tail fins, running boards and rumble seats, too., Use stop lights and parking lots to get a better look at cars of interest. Ride in a friend's car. Peek through a window at the controls. Ask people how they like their cars., While most of the cars on the road are less than 15 years old, many hobbyists and enthusiasts devote their time to restoring and maintaining older cars. Visit a classic car show, museum, or meet. Talk to the owners, if they're around, too. Many of them love to talk about their cars and their work, and they're experts on the subject.

, Read automobile magazines or websites to see what's new and what concept cars the manufacturers are dreaming up. Look around for new developments, too, such as fuel cells, hybrid, and electric vehicles.

, You probably spend plenty of time in traffic. Guess what a car is from down the street, then read the badges when you pull up next to it at a stoplight or walk past in a parking lot."

Decide the parameters of your people watching - It helps to know why you're watching.,
Practice naturalistic observation not intrusive nosiness.,
Select a location to watch from.,
Stay unobtrusive.,
Select a person on the street or nearby.,
People watch with a pal.,
Record the above thoughts on the person.,
Watch with good intent.,
Know how to react if the observed observes back.",How to Begin People Watching," There can be a number of reasons but the main impetus is observation of how other people live and behave under different circumstances. And watching people is not about feeling superior to others or judging them; more than anything, you're a non-judgmental observer with a penchant for unearthing life's stories as an art of love and empathy. Some reasons for people watching include:


It's relaxing and enjoyable - Seeing other people have fun, dressed up, going about daily activities is enjoyable and even soothing as you sit somewhere comfortable in a cafe or park bench under the sun. People are fascinating, so this reason really needs no more explanation!
It passes time while you're waiting for someone or while you're sitting with people who don't interest you much but you're obliged to stay with them.
It restores a sense of wonder. Children are renowned for people watching and just by trying it again, you can regain this sense of wonder for a brief moment of time.
It's informative. If you're writing a book or developing characters for a play, observing people can be an excellent way to find traits and styles for your characters. In addition, if you're an actor, observing other people is a window to other ways of standing, walking, talking, and interacting in a natural environment. And it's a great opportunity to test your learning or theories about body language.
It's an excellent source of artwork or photography. If you're an artist or a photographer, unaware people can make brilliant subjects.
It's inspiring. Watching people can lead to writing a symphony, movie script, or a blog post.
It's a healthy and much more interesting alternative to Facebook or Instagram stalking.;
, Naturalistic observation is the practice of observing subjects in their natural habitat.This means being unobtrusive, unnoticed, and non-interfering. The moment you become any of these things, the spell is broken and you've interacted and it's no longer ""people watching"".


Realize that some places are better for people watching than others. New York City, Paris, Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Venice present ideal venues for people watching because people know they're on display, and being seen. Any city where people dress up to show the world their fashion flair or sense of style is likely to be an ideal people watching place. Less so the country town or the little city unless you can do so with great care and not draw attention to yourself.
Some observation methods are likely to be more acceptable in some places than in others. Taking photos of people in New York City usually won't have anyone blink an eyelid; doing so in the only main street of a local town might raise concerns. Know where it's fine to take shots of people and where it's frowned upon and don't cross that line. If someone does see you taking photos of them and they don't like it, oblige them by erasing the shot; this isn't about causing bad feelings.

, The tried and true locale is sitting in a cafe looking out on a busy street. This is the classic Parisian positioning and even if it's cold, find yourself a suitably large and clean window to peer through. There are plenty of other options though, including:


Upstairs balcony of a shopping center.
Under a tree at the park, sitting around at lookouts,or anywhere that tourists and locals like to congregate.
Sitting around a public pool or at the beach; at a party or a rave (it's interesting to watch how people change as the event goes on).
As people enter or leave a movie theater, play, doctor's office, etc.
Taverns, pubs, bars, etc.
Theme parks, zoos, aquariums, and other places where your feet invariably get sore and you just need to sit down and watch the world pass by.
Dog runs. Where dogs socialize, so are their owners.
Stores, including thrift stores and bookstores.
Art galleries and museums.Observing people observing something else can be very entertaining, especially those people who discuss what the subjects in the painting are thinking - how far can you peel this Russian doll?!
Don't neglect public transportation; it's prime people-watching territory as you're all glued to the spot staring at one another!

, The important thing is to place yourself somewhere that you won't look conspicuous. This means making it appear that you're already occupied and not simply staring at people:


Look busy by reading, writing, or have something else to do while you watch.
Eat a meal or drink coffee or tea while you watch.
Wear sunglasses that make it hard to tell where you're looking.

, Find a person who grabs your attention and who isn't about to disappear before you've a chance to observe them properly. While observing them, think about what sort of person they might be:


Ask yourself questions about each person you choose: Why are they here? Are they happy? Nervous? Irritable? Why? What does the way they hold themselves say about them? What about the way they talk? Does it match up?
Look at their clothes: What do their clothes suggest about them? Are they wealthy or poor? Are they stylish or completely clueless about fashion? Are they adequately dressed for the weather or not? Are they part of any pop culture or sub-culture?
From their style and mannerisms, what do you think this person's aspirations, politics, or job would be?
Spot ""doppelgangers"". This means trying to see people who look like people you know or well-known people such as movie stars. Who knows, you might even see a real one!
Do you recognize anyone? As you age, the people passing by you might be former lovers, bosses, teachers, or classmates. Keep your attention focused!

, It can be twice the fun to people watch with a friend who is attuned to the art of people watching. Ask one another the questions outlined in the step above. You can even dispute each other's findings until you reach a shared conclusion that pleases both of you! Being able to share your thoughts on people watching can be both a fun and deeply connecting friendship ritual.

, This step is optional and for some people might turn people watching into a bit of a chore. However, if you're absolutely dedicated to people watching as a regular hobby, you might enjoy recording your thoughts about the people you've observed, and if you're an author (including bloggers) or an artist, you can build on these observations to inspire your writing or art.


Carry a notebook and pen around with you on days you decide to people watch. Make it a special book just for that purpose - turn the event into a ceremony. Write down the details of what you see and hear from each person, if you can sketch the way they hold themselves. It'll keep the process interesting and you'll have subjects to keep for years.
Consider your observed people potential character stock for your novels and record every mannerism.
Take painting or acting classes if you'd like to record your people watching moments unobtrusively without a camera.

, So that you don't come across as a voyeur or nosy body, be conscious of other people's need for privacy, space, and respect people at all times. Realize that you too are likely the subject of observation now and then, perhaps even as you're people watching one fine afternoon...

, Sometimes you will get caught observing and it will be considered staring. There are a number of ways to respond:


Simply smile, shrug, and look away.
Engage them in conversation if close enough, and explain what was so engaging or beautiful about them that made you look again.
Just look down and don't look up again until they've gone. For when you're feeling a little sheepish or afraid!
Physically turn away or get up and go if things seem uncomfortable.

Make time to meditate at work.,
Find a quiet spot, if possible.,
Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes.,
Focus on your breathing and body.,
Acknowledge your thoughts and let them go.,
Return to a state of awareness.",How to Do Computer Meditation1," When practiced daily, meditation can reduce your stress and anxiety, increase your focus and productivity, and improve your general well-being. When practiced in the workplace, meditation provides the same benefits. It can help you to relax, enhance your effectiveness as an employee, and improve your overall on-site experience. To reap these perks, set aside time to meditate each day:


Meditate during your lunch hour. The midday mental break will rejuvenate your mind.
Meditate at the end of your work day. Concluding your workday with a brief meditation session will enforce the boundary between your work life and your social/home life.
Meditate whenever you feel stressed or anxious. Taking a break from your busy schedule can actually help you overcome the feeling that you have too much to do.;
, While some workplaces have designated meditation spaces, many business do not. Do your best to find a quiet, comfortable, private location to practice your meditation. If you must remain in your cubicle or office, you can take the following steps to minimize the distractions:


Close your door and dim the lights.
Take your desk phone off the hook.
Turn off your cell phone.
Put your computer in sleep mode.
Wear earplugs or headphones., Take a seat in a comfortable chair. Place your feet firmly on the ground, rest your hands on your knees, sit up straight, and lift your chin. As you focus on an object in front of you, take several deep breaths. Gradually soften your gaze and close your eyes., As you concentrate on your breathing, listen to your heartbeat. Do not control your breath, just breathe naturally. Note how your body moves with every inhale and exhale.


How do your ribs move?
When do your shoulders rise?
How does your belly rise and fall?, As you meditate, thoughts will enter your mind. Instead of fixating on these thoughts, acknowledge that they exist and choose to let them exit your mind. Return your focus to your breathing.


Do not judge or assess your thoughts.
As you practice, you may begin to notice a pattern in your thoughts., Gradually return your attention to the present. Before opening your eyes, take several deep breaths. Instead of immediately returning to work, remain seated for a moment and take time to assess how the meditation made you feel.


You may choose to end your meditation session at any time. As you continue to practice, your sessions will get longer."
"
View your computer as an object of meditation.,
Assess your thoughts and feelings.,
Observe the computer screen for 2 to 3 minutes.",How to Do Computer Meditation2," While practicing mindfulness meditation, practitioners are urged to observe their thoughts, acknowledge their feelings, and then allow them to pass. They are not supposed to judge or fixate on their thoughts. Practitioners are now applying this meditation technique to their work on the computer. This requires you to disengage from work and take a moment to observe and acknowledge the letters, spaces, images, and thoughts displayed on the screen., Pause from your work for a brief mindfulness meditation session. Slide your chair back, close your eyes, and or slow your breathing. Ask yourself the following questions and take a mental note of your responses:


”What do I feel in this moment?”
”What am I thinking about in this moment?”
”How am I present in this moment?”
”How am I not present in this moment?”, Once you are aware of your own thoughts and feelings, turn your attention to the computer screen. The goal of this exercise is to use the computer to transport yourself into a state of calmness, relaxation, and mindfulness that will then carry over to the rest of your workday. As you practice:


Take note of the letters in a word, the sentences in a paragraph, and the thoughts they are conveying.
Acknowledge the icons on your desktop, the empty spaces on an open web page, and the cursor in the corner of your screen.
If your mind wanders, return your attention to the screen.
Gradually regain your awareness and return to work feeling refreshed and refocused. "
"
Take a series of deep breaths to relieve stress.,
Stretch your neck and shoulders to release tension.,
Stretch your chest to relax your muscles.",How to Do Computer Meditation3," If you don’t have an appropriate meditation space, you can use deep breathing exercises to enter into a state of mindfulness and relaxation. During a long day at work, deep breathing exercises can help you to recharge and refocus.


Take a seat in a chair or on the floor.
Take a deep inhale through your nose for 4 counts (Inhale, 2, 3, 4).
Hold your breath for 4 counts (Hold, 2, 3, 4).
Exhale through your nose for 4 counts (Exhale, 2, 3, 4).
Hold your breath for 4 counts (Hold, 2, 3, 4).
Repeat this series 10 times.

, After sitting in front of a computer all day, your body may become tense, knotted, and sore. Stretching your tired muscles is an excellent way to release tension, refresh your mind, and take a short break from the computer. The shoulder stretch is work appropriate. It will help to relax your neck and shoulders.To execute the shoulder stretch:


Interlace your fingers, lift your arms above your head, and place your palms up.
Hold the stretch for 5 deep breaths, breathing in and out through your nose.
Release the stretch and roll your shoulders.
Repeat the stretch again.
As you stretch, focus on your posture: look straight ahead, align your arms with your ears, and relax your shoulder blades., Sitting in front of a screen all day can wreak havoc on your posture. You may slouch and slump your shoulders. To counteract the negative side effects of this poor computer posture, your can execute a heart opener stretch. In addition to releasing tension, this stretch provides you with an opportunity to step away from your computer and refocus your mind.


Stand with your feet hip-distance apart.
Move your arms and hands behind you.
Clasp your hands together to form a fist at the base of your back.
Look forward, pinch your shoulder blades together, and elevate your hands and arms as high as you can.
Hold this stretch for five deep breaths, breathing in and out through your nose.
Repeat if desired."

Work outdoors.,
Apply masking tape.,
Expose a patch to repair.,
Brush off deteriorated foam.,
Glue and press.,
Remove the masking tape next to the glue.,
Re-roll.,
Wait to drive the car.",How to Restick a Peeling Padded Car Door Trim Insert Panel on a Ford Mustang," Deteriorated foam bits are messy and slightly sticky, stray contact cement is messy and super-sticky, and contact-cement solvent is foul and unhealthy. Put on some ugly clothes and your safety glasses. Arrange to sit on an ugly stool behind the door completely open so that drips will wind up on the ground (which is preferably not uniform, soil-showing concrete), not in the car. Gather gear, including the plastic spoons and paper towels to dab up messes before they harden or spread in the general area.
, Use masking tape to protect the area around and closely under the repair area. Apply short, overlapping, bent strips at curves, and tip the edges into indentations for optimal results. Also cover the armrest and any other areas that the side of the roller you'll use to press down the vinyl may brush against, in order to protect them from scratches., “If it ain't broke, don't fix it”: try to leave the door alone until the pad is loose at an edge. Messing with the insert involves some risk, and waiting for it to almost completely dry rot apart makes it easy to finish separating with little force. Once this has happened, peel the surface vinyl layer off to a point where the foam is somewhat sturdy, which provides access to clean out all deteriorated foam, and to which the panel could eventually be peeled from the other direction to the then-permanently-glued area to patch from that end. Leaving some attached eases alignment of the remainder. Peeling from the top edge down to the armrest and widest extent of the insert is a good start., Use the vegetable brush to gently scrape away dry-rotted foam and dirt from the back of the cloth-backed vinyl surface layer and from the fibrous backing still on the door. Use patience, not force, for stuck bits. Remove any accumulation at the edge of the peeled area. Create a basically-clean, smooth surface for the cover and door to bond securely and without lumps., Contact cement works well. It's usually used by applying to each surface, allowing them to dry to tackiness, and bringing them together to bond on...contact. But the vinyl panel and fibrous backing are permeable to fumes so it will eventually dry even if applied wet between the two. This has the advantage of allowing alignment and stretching of the pliable vinyl to the complex curves of the backing.

Take out a little cement at a time from the container to a plate and use a disposable small trim-size paintbrush to apply a brush-width's or so to the inside edge of the yet-to-be-glued area. (Generally, start near the arm rest.) Apply a generous, glossy but not gloppy coating. And work fast—not allowing the glue to over-dry first, leaving it able to penetrate, is more important than perfect uniformity.
Press the glued area down at edges (the back of a clean spoon works well) and across smooth areas with a soft roller. Continue with one brush-width's of glue after another. Gently scrape and wipe up any messes and switch to a clean tool or wash hands as needed to not spread them.
Check alignment of all edges from time to time as you go and promptly peel back the vinyl to reposition as necessary. Try to avoid stretching the vinyl or distending it in a particular direction but the ability to tip in edges requires only care, not perfection.

, Once you've finished applying the glue, firmly pressed down the vinyl, and verified it seems to hold, remove the masking tape directly in contact with the glued areas so that it is not itself joined permanently. Use a clean implement to push back down any vinyl that lifts with it. Leave some masking tape on the armrest or other areas that may need protecting from roller-axle scrapes., Every half-hour or so at first, and then every several hours over the next couple days, run the soft roller over the vinyl to ensure firm adhesion, especially pressing down any “bubbles” suspiciously reminiscent of the original delamination. They're not airtight – just hanging loose, and with soft glue inside ready to re-bond., The door panel will be delicate at first and its fumes will be foul. Don't drive the car for a few hours, and for the first couple days leave a window open."

",How to Create Printed Circuit Boards," Your choice will usually be based on the availability of materials needed by the method, the technical difficulty level of the method or the quality of PCB you desire to obtain. Here's a brief summary of the different methods and their main features that will help you decide:



Acid etching method: this method requires extreme safety measure, the availability of many materials such as the etchant and it is somewhat slow. The quality of PCB obtained varies according to the materials you use but generally, it is a good method for simple to intermediate levels of complexity circuits. Circuits involving more close wiring and tiny wires usually use other methods.

UV etching method: this method is used for transposition of your PCB layout onto your PCB board and requires more expensive materials that might not be available everywhere. However, the steps are relatively simple and can produce finer and more complicated circuit layouts.

Mechanical etching/routing method: this method requires special machines that will mechanically etch away unnecessary copper from the board or route empty separators between wires. It can be expensive if you intend to buy one of those machines and usually leasing them requires the availability of a workshop nearby. However, this method is good if you need to create many copies of the circuit and also can produce fine PCBs.

Laser etching method: this is usually used by large production companies, but can be found on some universities. The concept is similar to mechanical etching but LASER beams are used to etch the board. It is usually hard to access such machines, but if your local university is one of the lucky ones having such machine, you can use their facilities if they allow it.;
, For acid etching, you need to draw the circuitry using an etchant resistant material. Special markers can be found easily for this specific purpose if you intend to do the drawing by hand (not appropriate for medium to large circuits). Laser printers' ink is the most commonly used material however. This is usually done by converting your circuit's schematic diagram into a PCB layout using PCB layout software. There are many open source software packages for PCB layout creation and design, some are listed here to give you a head-start:


PCB
Liquid PCB
ShortCut

,, Print it out on a glossy paper, such as magazine paper. You should ensure the circuit is mirrored before doing that (most PCB layout programs have this as an option when printing). Once printed, make sure you don’t touch the ink part on the paper as it can get on your hands.

, Start up your iron. Set the iron on the cotton setting and wait until it heats up.

,,, Be careful, the paper will be hot. The paper should be stuck to the circuit board, don’t rip it out.

, An alternative approach is to immerse the board and paper in hot water for a few minutes (up to 10 minutes).

, If certain areas seem particularly difficult to peel off, you can try soaking a bit more. If everything went well, you will have a copper board with your PCB pads and signal lines traced out in black toner.

, Get the big chunks of water off by softly wiping with a napkin or just letting them fall out. It shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds and it should not be vigorous or else the ink on to the circuit might come off.

, This process removes any unnecessary copper from the board leaving only wiring of the final circuit.

, Ferric chloride is a common choice for an etchant. However, you can use Ammonium Persulfate crystals or other chemical solutions. No matter what choice for the chemical etchant, it will always be a dangerous material, so besides following the general safety precautions mentioned in this article, you should also read and follow any additional safety instructions that come with the etchant.

, Depending on the acid etch that you choose, there might be additional instructions. For example, some crystallized acids require being dissolved in hot water, but other etchants are ready to use.

,,,, There are special solvents available for almost all types of insulating drawing material used in drawing PCB layouts. However, if you don't have access to any of these materials, you can always use a sandpaper (a fine one).

, You may find the cards ready to use (they are covered with a black nylon sheet), or photosensitive spray to apply on the copper side of an ordinary blank PCB card. Take care to purchase also a photorevelator compatible with the photo spray or the PCB photosensitive coating.

,,,, It will irradiate your board with the UV for the specified amount of time. Most of the UV insulators are equipped with an adjustable timer. Generally, 15 to 20 minutes will be widely sufficient.

, Clean the copper side of the card with the photorevelator, then gently rinse the revelated PCB card with distilled water prior to place it in its acid bath. The parts destroyed by the UV irradiation will be etched by the acid.

,, Drilling machines used for that are usually custom machines designed specifically for this purpose. However, with some adjustments a usual drilling machine will do the job at home.

Make sure not to tighten all clamps until entire exhaust system is in place.

, The muffler should allow exhaust pipe to slide inside of it from either direction and, can be quite difficult at times a pair of pliers may be needed to stretch the ends of the muffler.

Choose a level, concrete surface (strong 3/4 inch plywood can make softer surfaces or the ground workable).,
Place a full width piece of 2 by 6, or 2x8 inch wood between a jack and the engine oil pan -- but not extending under the subframe.,
Loosen, but do not remove the upper nuts that connect the mount to the upper mounting-bracket using a ratchet and socket.,
Loosen the lower nuts: But, do not remove them from the bolt attaching them to subframe, through holes in the subframe, using your ratchet, an extension and a socket, for both mounts.,
The transmission mount: Prepare to remove the third mount much in the same manner as the engine mounts (of a different design) at the rear of the transmission This mount may need to be replaced for backward and forward stability.,
Remove the mount nuts and replace only one mount at a time: Raising the engine far enough with the jack to get either one of the mounts off, then replace it as follows.,Slide the studs on the bottom of the new mount into the holes in the subframe -- and lower the jack a little to seat the engine mounting bracket down lightly onto the stud(s) on the top of the mount, maintaining alignment, so not binding, by tightening nuts and bolts little by little.,Install the lower nuts and ""finger tighten"" at the subframe, loosely as before, just by a few threads, to retain the engine positioning.,
Install the upper nuts and ""finger tighten"", at the engine bracket, as well.,Install the transmission mount by much the same techniques as the engine mounts.,
Now, lower the engine a little.,
Finally, torque all the mount attaching nuts and bolts to the manufacturers recommended number of foot-pounds with a torque wrench and a socket.,
Remove the jack from under the oil pan.",How to Replace Motor Mounts on the Dodge Intrepid 1993 Through 2004," Set the parking gear and the brake. Block the wheels. Raise the front of the Intrepid with a jack(s) and support the car with jack stands. Remove the splash guards under each fender to reveal access to the mounts.
, Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all., (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine.,,,,,,

Install the heatshield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example).

,, Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only ""finger tight"". Then snug them all a little., The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds., Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower the Intrepid to the ground."

Take a deep breath and realize that things, while soggy now, will eventually be OK.;
,
Try your best to determine where the leak is coming from.,
If you are driving a 1998 Dodge Neon, let me tell you, the leak is coming from a cracked/missing gasket over the left taillight.,
Go to a service station with a car vacuum, spend a couple of dollars and suck out all the water.

,
Find something to bail with.,
Situate your car so that gravity helps you.,
Remove all floor carpets and hang somewhere to dry.,
Start scooping up the water with your bailing device.,
You may need to repeat Step 7 a few times, if the water continues to leak, or, if the water needs more time to soak back up through the carpet of your cute, but quickly-getting-less-cute 1998 Dodge Neon.

,
When your car looks dry... it isn't.,
Buy stock in Febreze, then buy it by the case-load.,
Enjoy your dry(ish) car and get that damn leaky gasket fixed.

",How to Bail Out of a Flooded 1998 Dodge Neon,", This is best accomplished by getting in your car while it is raining and twisting yourself into complicated shapes in an effort to get your ear closest to the sound of dripping water.

, To really make things cool, the water is leaking in and secretly traveling flume-style between your trunk lining and the metal outside of your car. It reaches the car floor, in the backseat, and then soaks UP through the carpet, leaving you to wonder for months how the floor was getting wet without any windows, doors or seats being wet also.

,, Try a red plastic Dixie cup, the kind preferred by 4 out of 5 fraternity social committees.

, Find a nice looking hill and park there so all the water sloshes to the back and accumulates, making it easier to bail.

, You'll want to wash/Febreze these to ward off Dreaded Swamp Odors.

, Continue as necessary until your car is no longer a cesspool.

,, Place old ratty towels on the floor to help soak up the rest of the water. It also makes your car more inhabitable until the carpet actually dries.

, The last thing you want is residual Dreaded Swamp Odor.

Return any parts which had a core charge to the retailer you purchased them from, for a refund of the core charge.",How to Change a CV Axle and Front Wheel Bearing on a 2001 4X4 Dodge Dakota," You can do the following steps to decide if the parts are worn enough to need replacing.
, Leaking CV joint boots, bent parts, or oil leaks are indicators of problems., You may have someone walk beside you in an empty parking lot while you drive slowly and steer the vehicle hard to the left and right., The wheels should be tight so that you are not able to shake them to the left and right or up and down. Use jack stands to be safe during this check., They should rotate without noticeable sound or vibrations., These may make a knocking or clicking sound if there is slack in them. They may also grind if severely worn parts are present., His advice may help you prevent unneeded repairs, and he may also be able to point out other parts that need attention., Since some parts may not be available off the shelf at your local auto parts supplier, checking availability before starting will save time, or at least prevent having an undriveable truck in the driveway for an extended period., Having the truck's information will help your auto parts supplier find the right parts for the job. The example here is a Dodge Dakota Sport, 2001 model, with a 4.7 liter (1.2 US gal) V-8 and 5 speed manual transmission. It also has four wheel antilock brakes, which does make a difference in the front wheel bearing hub assembly. You may be able to find all the information for your vehicle by the VIN number if your parts supplier has access to that database., For severe use, using premium quality parts will be worthwhile, but if you are shopping for economy, selecting a store brand can save over 50%. Make sure the parts are built to OEM specifications, however, so they are safe to use and fit properly.,, You may want to loosen the lug nuts before jacking the truck if you don't have an impact wrench for the lug nuts., Next, loosen the axle nut a half turn so it can be removed later. You may need a helper to hold the front brake while loosening the axle nut., There are two studs behind the caliper, these can be removed with an Allen wrench, either 3⁄16 or 1⁄4 inch (0.5 or 0.6 cm). Back the studs out, and remove the tension spring from the front of the caliper, then pry the pads back slightly from the brake rotor. Now the caliper can be slid off and tied back out of the way., Make sure you do not get grease or oil on its friction surfaces., Most are a 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) nut, and a socket is needed to remove it. If the nut will not turn without spinning the axle, use a long pry bar between two lug studs to keep it stationary., There are three bolts that secure it to the knuckle, they can be removed with a 14 mm (9/16 inch) wrench, but they are very tight, so a cheater pipe may be needed to break them loose. If the hub has an anti lock brake sensor, either disconnect the plug and remove the clips that secure the cable, or if you are replacing the hub, just cut the wire for the time being. If the hub is stuck tight, bump it and pry it out with a large screwdriver or pry bar., This will allow the knuckle to be dropped out of the way for removal of the CV axle. Be aware the three bolts that secure the ball joint to the upper control arm have self locking nuts so the threads may be damaged if they are removed. Since these ball joints are critical to the safety of the vehicle, you should seriously consider replacing them, especially considering the relatively low cost of these parts., The axle should slide off easily if the splines are not damaged, if it doesn't, you may have to use a slide hammer to persuade it. If a slide hammer is needed, be sure to carefully inspect the side shaft at the differential and replace it if needed., You can use a seal removal tool, or a flat blade screwdriver to pry it out., Put a dab of gasket adhesive around the outer ring of the seal, and a small dab of grease or gear oil on the inner ring to prevent damage and leaks., A little bit of gear oil on the splines will allow it to slide on easily., You may want to wrap the splines with a rag or paper towel to protect them from damage while positioning it., You will need to carefully center the CV axle splines through the hub assembly. Reinstall the three bolts that secure the assembly to the knuckle. These bolts must be torqued to the correct specifications, usually 150 foot (45.7 m) pounds. Do not use an impact wrench to install these bolts., If you reinstall the original upper ball joint, check the bolts to make sure there is no damage to the threads, if there is, you will need to use new bolts the same size and strength, with locking nuts. You may find you need a helper to position the upper control arm so the bolts in the ball joint line up. Tighten these bolts securely., Make sure you check the surfaces to be sure they are not warped, pitted, or damaged in any way. They should be smooth and shiny, with not discoloration that would indicate heat damage., Be sure the mounting studs are threaded correctly, as they have very fine threads that can be cross threaded if care is not taken. Install the brake spring on the outside of the caliper being sure it is centered so it will not run the rotor.,, You can check the vehicle's specifications for this nut, but at least make sure it is tightened securely. Replace the cotter pin in the end of the axle when the nut is tight., Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground. You can now retighten any bolts or lug nuts that turned while the wheel was off the ground.,, If you bought new parts, there may not be a core charge applied, so the old parts can be recycled or discarded."

Be familiar with the world’s most famous DJs.",How to Find a DJ Name That Isn't Taken," By far the quickest, most direct way to see if a DJ name is taken is to do a thorough search on your search engine of choice. If another DJ has already chosen your name, his or her website or social media page will usually be included in the results. Keep in mind, however, that obscure artists may not appear on the very first page.


Remember that the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. While seeing another DJ pop up in the search results can be a strong hint that the name you've chosen is already taken, not seeing another DJ isn't necessarily proof that the name isn't taken. For definitive proof, it's best to couple your initial search with one of the other methods below.;
, One way to check whether a certain name has been taken is to use an online name-finding site. These sites usually check large databases of site listings to tell whether the domain name you input has already been registered. Best of all, many of the best name-finders are 100% free.Note again, however, that just because someone hasn't already purchased a website that uses your stage name in its address doesn't mean that no DJ has already taken your name — someone using your name may just not have a strong online presence.

, In the modern world, even the smallest bands and musical artists often have pages on social network sites like Facebook. Searching popular social networks for usernames or pages that match your DJ name is one great way to check whether it's been taken. Since the most popular social networks are free to join, you have a good chance of uncovering even the most obscure artists this way.


While Facebook is the most popular social network site on the planet, it's far from the only one.Thus, you'll save lots of time by using one of several online utilities that instantly search multiple social network sites (like namechk.com) rather than searching each individually., Musical artists' names can legally be trademarked by their owners — this includes names like R.E.M., which have alternate meanings, names like Paul McCartney, which are simply the artist's actual name, and, of course, DJ names.Thus, searching a trademark database is one fairly definitive way of determining whether a name is already taken. If you can find a trademark registered for the DJ name you've chosen, this means that someone else has already taken your name and has legal grounds to force you to change yours if there's a likelihood you may be confused as artists.Some trademark databases are free to search, while others may cost a small fee. For a fairly definitive list of trademark databases, consult uspto.gov, the official site of the US Patent and Trademark Office., If you find out that the DJ name you want for yourself has already been trademarked, you may be out of luck. Trademark owners have a legal claim to their trademark, especially in cases where you are likely to be confused with the trademark holder (like, for instance, if you are both active musicians in the same geographical area). This risk increases if your logo, font choices, and aesthetic direction seems to match or imitate the trademark holder's. Musical artists can (and have) sued rivals who were unwilling to cooperate with a name change.Luckily, there are ways around this sort of trademark infringement. The most direct is simply to change your DJ name. You may also be ""off the hook"" if you can prove that you don't directly compete with the trademark holder — for instance, if you're only well-known in New York State and the copyright holder is only well-known in Florida, you may not need to change your name until one of you begins touring and promoting your act on the other's home turf.

, Try to think of famous DJs with names that contain more than four syllables. If you can think of any, there are probably only one or two in your mind. Most DJs don't have especially long names, and with good reason — the longer your stage name is, the harder it is for people to remember and the less likely it is that it will sound ""catchy"".


For example, imagine that a new DJ who specializes in spinning diss tracks wants to call himself ""Diss-establishmentarianism"". While the ""diss"" pun is amusing, this name will have a hard time catching on — if the DJ's fans have a hard time remembering his name (let alone pronouncing it), his word-of-mouth potential is seriously limited.

, Don't name yourself after a passing trend, a sub-genre of electronica that may not be popular in a few years, or anything else that doesn't have long-term appeal. These sorts of names immediately date you and make it harder to capture new listeners' attentions after your name loses significance. Instead, pick a name that has lasting relevance — something that won't sound silly a few months or a few years down the road.


For example, imagine that an up-and-coming DJ named himself ""DJ Harlem Shaker"" during the height of the meme's popularity in February 2013. This a bad move — within just a few months, the meme's popularity had faded dramatically, so this DJ's name would probably sound hackneyed., Ideally, the syllables in your DJ name should complement each other and produce the effect you want to convey when spoken. Some names sound smooth and pleasing, while others sound cold and sinister — depending on the type of music you play, you may want to choose to use softer or harsher sounds in your name.


For example, words with g's, k's, z's, t's and hard c's tend to be hard and edgy and are considered cacophonous, or phonetically unpleasant. In contrast, words with many l's, w's, long o's, y's, s's, and soft c's tend to sound soft and fluid and are considered euphonious, or phonetically beautiful. A DJ might want to go with either of these styles, so choose your own sounds accordingly to make the name appropriately gritty for your persona.

, In radio broadcasting, the names of people, places, and events that are being promoted on-air should ideally pass something called the ""radio test"". This isn't as complicated as it sounds — the radio test is just a simple way of telling whether your name will be intelligible to listeners who can only hear it spoken — not written out.Generally, the more complex your DJ name is, the harder it will be for people to understand on the radio.


A name that passes the radio test should be easy to understand just from the way it sounds while spoken. It shouldn't be hard for the announcer or the listener to pronounce or spell — remember, people who will be hearing your DJ name on air may not have ever heard of you before.
For instance, imagine that there's a DJ named ""DotComrad3."" This name would have a hard time passing the radio test. Someone reading it on-air might have to say something like, ""If you liked the song you just heard, check out the artist's website — www.Dotc0mrad3.com. That's w, w, w, dot (as in a period), ""Dot"" (as in the word ""dot""), c, zero (not o), m, r, a, d, 3 (not e)."" This is a serious mouthful for the radio announcer to get through — if he doesn't make a mistake, there's a good chance many of the listeners will.

, If you're looking to make a career out of your DJing skills, you may want to consider a potential name's aesthetic qualities before making a final decision. Some names naturally lend themselves to good-looking logos and on-stage designs, while others may require you to do a little more work to pick visual components that ""fit"". There's no right or wrong answer here — this is just a question of how far you're willing to go in service of your image as a DJ.


For example, a DJ who calls herself ""White Tiger"" might naturally want to use lots of tiger imagery in her on-stage show. She might, for instance, wear a tiger mask on stage while she spins her music. If she has access to a projector, she might even project psychedelic tiger designs onto herself during her show.
On the other hand, a DJ with a name like ""DJ Palindrome"" has a logo that practically designs itself. Since palindromes are words that are spelled the same way forwards and backwards, DJ Palindrome's logo might look like this: PalindromemordnilaP — basically, as if it's reflected in a mirror.

, This is the age-old question that every DJ has to face at one point or another: whether or not to include ""DJ"" in his or her name. There's no right or wrong answer here — many of the modern world's most famous DJs (like Tiesto, etc.) have decided to forego the ""DJ"" prefix, while many others choose to keep it. It's up to you!


In general, including the ""DJ"" may give a slightly more ""old-fashioned"" or ""classic"" flavor to your image because of the tendency of old-school hip-hop DJs to include ""DJ"" in their stage names (see: DJ ). This is by no means universal, however, so try to consider each name on a case-by-case basis.

, One old standby for any musician's name is to make a reference to a musical concept or piece of terminology. Some of the most famous artists of all time have used this well-worn trick (see: The Beatles, The Moody Blues, etc.). Ideally, if you do this, you might want to make reference to musical terms that are likely to be understood by a wide audience — for instance, while almost everyone knows what a ""beat"" is, not everyone will know what the term ""syncopation"" means. Below are just a few ideas for the types of words you may want to incorporate into your name:


Musical terminology (beat, note, tempo, chord, song, symphony, etc.)
Music genres (rock, disco, techno, etc.)
Specific songs or bands (for example, Radiohead, Phoenix, and The Rolling Stones are all named after other bands' songs)., Some musical artists, including DJs, choose to simply use their real name as their stage name. Others, however, modify their name in a way that makes it catchy or memorable. Some even choose to change their name in a way that makes it a pun or play on words — your ability to do this, obviously, depends on what your actual name is.


For example, M.I.A, the Sri Lankan rapper with international hits like ""Paper Planes"", uses a name that is a play on her own (Maya), as well as a reference to the abbreviation for the term ""Missing in Action"".
Another well known example is Eminem — this name is a reference to the artist's initials (MM, for Marshall Mathers) as well as the phonetic pronunciation of his old stage name (M&M)., If there are certain things, places, people, or ideas in your life that are extremely important to you, consider referencing them (or just outright including them) in your DJ name. There are a huge range of possible topics to draw from that range from silly to grim — whatever is important to you in life is fair game. Below are just a few ideas of the sorts of things you may want to consider using in your name:


Religious references (see: Matisyahu)Political references (see: Rage Against the Machine)
Literary references (see: Modest Mouse, As I Lay Dying)
References to specific people or places (see: Lynyrd Skynyrd)

, Sometimes, it's easiest to come up with a good name simply by studying other people's name. However, when you're trying to get inspiration from the names of great DJs, remember that your ultimate goal is to stand out from the pack — not blend into it. Just a few of the most influential DJs and beatmakers ever from the worlds of dance music and hip hop are listed below — there are many, many more:DJ Shadow

Prepare for the party's audio system.",How to Use Spotify to DJ at a Party1," There are two types of accounts you can sign up for in Spotify. There is the free version and the premium version. You will have to buy the premium account because it does not interrupt the music with ads. Advertisements will ruin your playlist if you’re DJing a party.


The audio quality of the premium account is high definition (320kbps).
You can upgrade your free account to a premium account without changing any of your login information.Premium costs $9.99 per month.;
, The sound quality and buffering speed is better on Spotify's downloaded application, opposed to their web browser. You can download spotify for both Macs and PCs. If you use a Linux or Chromebook, you’ll be forced to use the web player.


You can use the web browser if you don’t want to take up space on your computer. The audio quality and usability is better through the app.
It is important for a DJ to have reliable equipment, and having the application downloaded is one way of doing this.

, Go to File --> New Playlist. The playlist will appear in the list on the left hand side. Title it a memorable name that relates to the party you’re DJing. You could try something like:


Bill and Tod Special Day
Kool-Aid in the Sun
Fire in February: Chicago House

, Consider the occasion of the party before you begin dragging your favorite songs to the playlist. Most DJs include upbeat music that facilitates a dancing crowd. Select songs that you find particularly upbeat. To add songs, drag a track you like into the playlist.


Spotify automatically imports all music files on your computer into Spotify. To find your stored music, click on the tab that reads ""Local Files."" Now, you can drag files from iTunes or other applications into your playlist.
Search for songs. Type names or artists into the search bar on the upper left side to find matches.
Search your friend's playlist for music suggestions. Type the name of a friend into the search bar and view playlists that they have allowed Spotify to show.
Go to Spotify's Top Lists to find popular, trending music. You can also adjust the result to filter different countries, daily or weekly, and by date.

, Right click on the name of the playlist and choose ""Collaborative Playlist"". Now, when your friends view the playlist, they will be able to add music to it as well. You can share the link with specific people over Spotify or by copying the URL (Right click on the playlist, and then copy the HTTP link) and paste it into a message or email.

, Put yourself in the partygoers’ shoes while you look over your playlist. Parties grow in a gradual process depending on the party and depending on the people. You don’t want to start with the crowd favorites like “P.Y.T.” or “All Night Long.”


If you’re not sure where to start, Motown soul hits are a good way to start things off. Play some older funkier soul music to start the night with positive vibes.
As the party gets going, throw in some more classic party tracks like hip-hop or The Bee Gees.
Once the dance floor begins to get a good crowd, you should start playing the heavy hitters.
While it is nearly impossible to plan out the party’s crowd before the party, you can plan the length of the party. Depending on the gig, you should shoot for about three hours of music. The climax of the party will probably be in the last quarter of those three hours.

, Some venues will not offer you wifi and you should be prepared for this. The premium Spotify account offers an “Offline Mode” that can be selected through “File” in the menu bar. Before you select the offline mode, you need to download your playlist and any other materials you think you might need. On the top right part of your playlist, toggle the “Available Offline” to green. This will download the full playlist onto your machine.


Keep your computer powered and connected to the wifi while your playlist is being downloaded. The green arrow will indicate the playlist is finished downloading.You can only download playlists you’ve created or ones that you are following.
You might want to add extra songs to your playlist in case someone wants to request a song.

, Contact the location or coordinator of the party for details about the audio system. They might have surround sound, a Bluetooth speaker, or nothing at all. If they don't have any audio system, the easiest device to bring is a portable speaker (Bluetooth or cabled). If they say that they have a stereo or speaker you can connect to, it is best to bring a few adapter cables just in case:

Bring a RCA to 1/8"" cable. These are excellent for connecting your device to an old stereo system that only uses RCA inputs. An RCA audio cable has two prongs that are color coated (red and white).
The other cable that is versatile for DJing is an 1/8"" cable. These cables can be plugged into headphone jacks (from your computer) into auxiliary jacks on their system.
You might also want to additionally bring a 1/4"" converter for your 1/8"" cable. The converter could be useful if you need to plug your device into an amplifier or a P.A.

R&B, If your playlist is about to go in a direction you’re not feeling, make adjustments. The job of a DJ is to enact the feelings and desires of the crowd. Watch how the crowd reacts to your selections and determine if one style of music works better than another.

, If you decide to take requests, you can either add them to the playlist, or to the queue so that it plays as the next song. To add it to the queue, right click on the song and choose ""Queue"" from the drop-down menu that appears.To view the queue, click on it in the left hand menu. ""Play Queue"" should appear in the top section directly under the inbox.

, Spotify has collaborated with established DJs and producers to give you a wide range of moods and party types. Spotify party has different settings to gauge the feeling of party through the “Mood Tuner.” You can start your night with “start it up,” gradually move into “hold it down,” and then drop the “set it off” mood when everyone’s on the dance floor.You can even use Spotify party for the morning after and any other mood or situation you want to use.
Spotify party fades in between songs like a normal DJ would do.

Be aware that these producer DJs had a hit at some point in their career.",How to Get DJ Gigs," Before you go out hunting for gigs, make sure you are ready for it. There is nothing worse than finally getting the opportunity to play, then screwing it up. Assuming you did your homework already, it still might make sense to go through the checklist offered below. If you can answer all these questions with a confident ""Yes"", then go on. Otherwise, your time is better spent on preparation. Here is the checklist:


Are you perfectly familiar with the gear that you will be using at the venue you want to play? Did you find out what kind of equipment they have installed? If you want to bring your own controller - is there enough space in the booth to set it up?
Do you have your mixing skills in place? Have you played a continuous three-hour set at home without messing up a single mix?
Do you have enough material and sets together so you can react to the crowd? In order to be spontaneous, you have to be very well prepared. You should have at least three sets in place to pick what's best during the gig.
Do you have a demo CD? When you go meet club owners, you should have a demo CD on you; this should be a 30 to 60 minute mix CD with a printed label on it.
Do you have name cards? DJing is a business and to leave a professional impression, you need a decent name card that includes your DJ name, email, mobile number and your web links.
Do you have a website, or at least a Facebook Fan page, which links to your SoundCloud or MixCloud profile so that a potential customer can check you out online? Are there at least two to three mixes of yours available on your pages?;
, As with all businesses, when it comes to finding job opportunities, it's not about what you know but all about who knows you. Typically, in the beginning of your DJ career, not too many people out there will know you as a DJ. But that's okay. Every star was a beginner at some point without much of a supporting network. A network can be built up. This section explains how to do that.

, Check whether any of your acquaintances is related to the DJ scene. Reach out the them, be honest about where you are in your DJ career and ask them if they know of a gig opportunity for you. And if they don't, ask if they can introduce you to someone who does. You'll be surprised how many people, even if they can't offer you a gig, still know someone who might. Follow up with those introductions.

, This is easy to do because these people will be present and approachable during their club nights and events most of the time. Find out who is the manager of the club (ask the bartender), introduce yourself with a prepared little 30-second presentation and hand over your demo CD. Find the people you met this way on Facebook and start interacting with them.


One important thing to know about club managers: They don't care much about your music. This can be difficult to digest for enthusiastic young DJs, but these folks are mostly interested in the cash they bring home at the end of a night. No way to blame them - that's their job. So in order to cater for your client's needs––which is the essence of every service, including DJing––focus on how you can bring a spending crowd to the place rather than on how fancy your music is.

, Now that you have your list of potential clients, the most important part is to follow up. The biggest mistake you can make now is to walk away after the first ""no"". There is a rule of thumb in marketing that you have to get into your client's face seven times before he or she will consider to buy from you. Be persistent. Come back again and again, always being polite, of course. Establish a relationship. People are impressed with persistence. If you don't give up easily, they will know you are serious and determined. Nothing can stop true determination.

, Clubs naturally focus on making their weekend happen, plus other special nights like ""Ladies nights"" and so on. On these nights, they will be very particular about who gets to play the music because a lot of risk is at hand. Not easy to get in for a newcomer. But there are other nights - the odd nights. Normally during weekdays, not much happens there and mostly there is no DJ booking, since it doesn't make sense economically. Targeting those odd nights and coming up with a proposal to play for little money or even better, bring a crowd, can be a very successful strategy to get your first foothold in a club. As soon as you get in and make those odd nights a success - even a small one - chances are you will be offered a weekend night as well. And boom - here comes your residency.

, Ask yourself:


How did they get there?
Do they mix a hundred times better then the average club DJ? In most cases, definitely not. Some even do much worse.

, They managed to produce and publish a track which got some international attention. And when people around the world, even if it's in a tiny underground music niche, know your name, love your music and want to see you play live - that's when the bookers will start calling you and asking you to play in Ibiza. Production is not for everyone and is a topic to be covered in books rather than articles, but if you have some musical talent and an drive to make music, this could be very well worth the effort. A label deal to happen will probably take years rather than months. But if make it happen, this is how you become an internationally renowned DJ.

But whatever the nature of your agreement, you need to spend some time before the set sketching out a basic theme, with at least your first five tracks laid out.


Are you going to stick with straight-up club jams, or are you going to throw any surprises into the mix? Old-school disco fist-pumpers? Rock songs? Make sure you've got any swerves prepared for on your disc drive, or in your record crate.
You can always throw the plan away, but at least you'll have something to start with and get a chance to read the crowd. If you drop a trance-beat banger and nobody moves, you'll know you need to switch up the theme. If the place goes wild, you've found your groove.;
, If you've got your head buried in your vinyl crate and your mixers the whole time, you're going to lose them. It's important for a club DJ to pay close attention to what the crowd seems to be responding to, how they're reacting, and what the energy level seems to be in the room. It won't always be obvious, but a good DJ can learn to spot a crowd's needs before they're even aware of it themselves.


Watch for bangers. Some songs will get people pouring onto the dancefloor, which you'll need to follow up with at least 2-4 similar songs to keep the party going. After that, you might start slowly transitioning away from that style, but matching beats so people won't lose it.
Watch for the exodus. Likewise, keep an eye out for clunkers. If you throw on something with vocals and all of a sudden people lose it, consider dropping back into your straight-up instrumental set. Find out what people don't like.

, If every other DJ's going to play it, you might think you're above that new Top 10 single, but if people want to hear the newest dance jams, you'll be doing the crowd a disservice not to play it. Try to stay abreast of the commercial dance music that people are likely to want to hear.


You don't have to play the basic song, consider drop a remix or a mash up, or remix it live. Maybe make a few edits of the most popular songs before you go and drop those.

, Every crowd will be different, and crowds can even change over the course of an evening, or over the course of an hour. Some crowds will want to trance out to nothing but heavy-banging house all night, while others will want to hear some Jackson 5. Pay attention to what works and what doesn't, and have a steady stream of old-school dance classics at your disposal.


Sometimes a crowd that skews ""older"" may seem like an obvious choice for wanting classics, but not necessarily. Any time you're DJing for a non-club type of club atmosphere, in which the crowd isn't necessarily dance-music enthusiasts, you're likely to win the dancefloor will some well-timed classics.

, People are out to have a good time, not to think hard about the heady and artistic set of experimental electronic dance music you're curating. Give them the music fix they need, get them to dance, and reflect their energy back into your mixes. That's your job.


There's no such thing as ""a bad crowd,"" but there is such a thing as a bad DJ. Good DJs can read the room and supply an appropriate soundtrack. People may dance, people may not dance, but it's your job to do the best you can to read the room and reflect the vibe.

, If you Try to cut between some industrial remix of a Led Zeppelin tune mashed up with Biggie vocals and the new Katy Perry song, it's likely that you'll leave some heads scratching, even if the BPMs match. Try to make your stylistic transitions as smooth as possible, matching sounds, styles, energy, and beats.

, Don't do blatantly obvious mixing between tracks, mixing into another track if both are clearly audible. Cut some sound out of one track and slowly bring up the rest of it. Cut the bass and just leave the drums and slowly bring the bass up.


Some tracks like Mickey Slim's remix of ""Jump Around"" change dramatically, so use that to your advantage. If the song slows down, mix a couple of slow tracks between it and then bring it back to where it was.

, If your set is going fast, keep it that way and only slow down if you want people to chill for a second. If you're speeding up, make it gradual, or surprising, not just some blatant full speed up halfway through a 90 bpm track to 125bpm so you can mix it into a house record.


A good idea is to loop a standout line in the song and then slowly speed it up and mix to the next record. Don't confuse people, when it comes to changing speeds it's mainly faster, not slower, and always gradual, or surprising.

, Everybody wants to have a good time, including the DJ. But if you're not in a clear-headed place, it'll be too easy to lose track of the room. Save your free drink tickets until after your set is over and celebrate a job well done. Don't get bombed and think you can pull off a set made entirely of weird Finnish TV theme song mixes. That's weird, and sober-you would agree.

, If you have a professional set-up and only cut from track to track with the crossfader and beatmix, that's just being lazy. All turntables and mixers have at least a few effects, and even the most basic setups nowadays have at least three. You have effects, so use them.


You can get echo effects, loop buttons, sample record buttons in your set-up, so learn how to add them to your mixes and sets.
All mixers have the equalizer knobs, so you can use these for things like cutting off the bass or removing everything except the vocal track.
Experiment with every button on your mixer. Even the play/pause button can be used for things, and in the end however you choose to use these it will be all your personal DJ style.

, It's not all mixing tracks. You have to throw your entire self into the mix, using hand gestures to lead the crowd. A few hand waving movements go a long way, but you can utilize hand claps, fist pumps, and other movements to get the whole crowd moving along with the music.


Move around. If a DJ seems to be digging what they're hearing, people will get on board. If you look like a scientist tweaking dials, people are likely to be intimidated. Make it seem like you're having fun.

, You're the master of ceremonies, so master that ceremony. Talk to people, field requests, chat up cute dancers, shout-out people's birthdays, ask if everyone's having a good time. Be the face of the party and facilitate the good vibes.


It's also good to know when to shut up. Talking to a crowd can be cool, but no more than once an hour is a good rule of thumb. If you're talking between every song, you're ruining it.

, Uniqueness is important, but it's not the most important thing about being a DJ. Playing a room is a craft. You can put your own spin on things, but it's also important to familiarize yourself with the great DJs of the past, to learn as much as you can about the footsteps you're walking in. This will make you a more humble, talented, and interesting DJ as you move forward. If you want to throw down a dope DJ set in a club, you need to know about and hear the stylings of the following DJs:


Chemical Brothers
Grandmaster Flash
David Mancuso
DJ Andy Smith
Ram Jam Rodigan
DJ Chuckie
DJ Cash Money
DJ Marky
Carl Cox
Jam Master Jay

Classify rock music.,
Identify top 40 pop music.,
Classify country music.,
Understand soul and R&B.,
Identify rap and hip hop.,
Classify electronic music.",How to Classify Music by Genre1," Rock n’ roll is a broad form of pop music that contains nearly a hundred spin offs and subgenres. The characteristic sound of rock n’ roll is a strong beat, simple (sometimes advanced) chord structure, and played loudly. Rock n’ roll was born in the 1950s out of rhythm and blues. It typically features an electric guitar (sometimes distorted), drums, bass, and vocals.


There are several variations of rock n’ roll that makes defining the genre difficult.
Some of the early rock pioneers are The Kinks, Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Buddy Holly, and Bo Diddley.Rock n’ roll evolved through the 1960s, 1970s, and each following decade. In the 1970s, punk rock was born. In the 1980s, metal and hair metal was born. In the 1990s, grunge hit the scene as well as countless other styles.
If you hear a song with a strong beat and personality, you might be correct to classify it as rock.;
, Top 40 is a way of tracking the success of a pop song, based on listeners and popularity. Today top 40 has turned into a genre of pop of its own. Its music is written by songwriters and produced by a music corporation. The easiest way to find this music is by skimming through your radio stations until you find the “pop” station.


The songs of top 40, more than any other genre, are designed to be catchy and get stuck in your head. With this idea embedded into the songwriting process, top 40 songs typically have a grandiose chorus that repeats several times.Some popular figures of top 40 hits are Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and Keke Palmer.

, Country music, like all other genres, continues to grow and develop into subgenres. Country music’s strongest emphasis is the narrative of the song. The song remains in a pop song format with a verse and chorus. It is also characteristic for the singer to have a bit (or a lot) of twang. Since country music is fixated more on the song’s narrative, instruments play less of a role. Instruments popular in country music are acoustic guitars, pedal steel guitars, and other folk instruments.The roots of country start with the honky tonk days of the 1950s. The most celebrated star from this decade is Hank Williams.
Folk music is another popular subgenre of country. Folk music takes the narrative focus of country and intensifies the storytelling. Popular folk musicians are Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan.

, Soul and rhythm & blues are genres of music inspired by gospel and blues music. These genres represent a larger umbrella of genres of music created by African Americans. Soul music is characterized by powerful vocals and a catchy groove accompanying it. R&B is another large genre that has roots in the 1950s and transformed around the late 1980s into a catchier form of pop.


Early soul pioneers include Solomon Burke, Ben E. King, and Aretha Franklin.
Early R&B started in a minimal style like Big Joe Turner and Fats Domino. The genre took on more influences in the 1960s with the Mar-Keys and James Brown. Later R&B took on a hip hop influence with artists like Mary J. Blige and Boyz II Men.
Another influential genre that took shape under these genres is funk. Funk is all about being exceptionally groovy. Listen to artists like Funkadelic, 1970s era James Brown, and Sly Stone and the Family Stone., Rap and hip hop has an easy indicator to tell you what genre you’re listening to. The name comes from the vocalist rapping over the beat. Rap is a form of poetry that accompanies music. Rap and hip hop got its start in the late 1970s with acts like Grandmaster Flash and Blowfly. The genre evolved, and continues to evolve.Today rap is a major influence on pop music.
Some examples of rap's subgenres are gangsta, trap, chicano, and ghetto house.

, Electronic music is another umbrella that can crossover into multiple genres. The key indicator of electronic pop music is the heavy reliance on synthesizers or computers. Synthesizers became accessible to artist in the 1970s, which can be heard on Herbie Hancock's 1973 hit, “Chameleon.”


Electronic music has developed into several genres of popular music. In the 1990s, techno became a popular dance music that is still happening. Techno evolved into EDM and dubstep, which are both popular.
There is electronic aspects in a vast amount of music being produced today.

Know experimental music’s roots.,
Determine a blend in pop and experimental music.,
Identify ambient music.,
Know minimalist music.",How to Classify Music by Genre2," Experimental music began to take shape in the early to mid 1900s with the rising influence of Black Mountain College. Several classically trained composers began to experiment with what it means to write a composition. Today several artists and musicians take a pop genre, like techno, and experiment with it. The result, if done successfully, is an entirely different sound.


An example is Stockhausen’s “Helicopter String Quartet,” which requires four helicopters and each member of the quartet to occupy a separate helicopter while playing in unison., Since the 1960s, certain musicians have been interested in blurring the line between a conventional pop song and something completely different. There is a trend in psychedelic experimental music to disrupt pop conventions. Bands like Acid Mother Temple do this by creating a hook through a melody and then branch off into a cosmic jam.


Captain Beefheart’s infamous album, Trout Mask Replica, is a fully composed album, but the record sounds like improvisation and insanity.

, In the mid 1970s, when the synthesizer were beginning to build momentum, certain artist found a new way to use the instrument. Being inspired from Indian ragas and other types of droning Eastern classical music, ambient music creates an atmosphere for the listener.


Brian Eno popularized ambient music with compositions like “Music for Airports,” which was composed to be played in airports.
Another interesting cross genre is noise music. Noise music is loud and chaotic, but it oftentimes creates a consistent ambient wall of sound.

, Minimalist music refers to a specific scene of musicians in the 1960s up to the present day, who wrote music “minimally.” The term itself does not fairly describe the music. Minimalist music is best characterized by several “minimal” layers of music stacked on top of each other to create something incredibly complex.


Philip Glass wrote an opera called “Einstein on the Beach,” which embodies this idea of stacking minimal melodies to create something massive.
Other pioneers of the genre, Steve Reich and Terry Riley, have their own style of creating minimalist music.

Look at the time period the piece of music was written.,
Identify early classical music.,
Classify Baroque music.,
Identify the “classical” movement.,
Identify the Romantic era.,
Understand modern classical music.,
Learn key figures and pieces of classical music.",How to Classify Music by Genre3," For classical music, much of the classification relies heavily on what century the piece was written. Typically when people talk about “classical music” they are referring to European music. The date of a piece of music can tell you information about the art movement the piece was written. Art movements act, in a way, as genres for classical music.


To best understand classical music and its characteristics, learn the different art movements.

, Early classical music refers to music created by monks and Roman Catholic church officials before the 9th century. The earliest example of this style is the Gregorian Chants. Legend claims the chants were written by Pope Gregory, but scholars are now skeptical of this claim. The chants were performed by a group of monks. This is the first time music was written down in musical notation and features melodies to be sung along with words (in Latin).


A good indicator that music is from this time period is if it is a cappella and sung in Latin.

, The Baroque era is best exemplified as being artistically grandiose and features elaborate decorations. The influence of the church started to weaken in this era, which roughly lasts from 1600 to 1750. The Baroque era birthed orchestral music and opera. Another key sound of the Baroque era is the harpsichord.The harpsichord is played like a piano, but instead of hitting the strings with soft mallets, the strings are plucked like a harp. This gives the harpsichord a unique and sharp tone.

, The classical period contains some of the most identifiable pieces of music. This is the era of recognizable composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert. Classical music is known for its finely tuned attention to detail and structural clarity. Instead of a rococo style of decorative detail, music from the classical age focused on symmetry and sensibility.This era runs parallel with the intellectual movement called the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment birthed the rising belief that human reasoning can overcome problems of the world. This influenced the way composers treated compositions.

, The Romantic era of music lasted from 1820 up into the 20th century, ending roughly in 1915. Key identifiers of music from this era are its implications of fantasy, spontaneity, and sensuality.The artistic movement itself was centralized on the idea of fleeting back to nature due to the Industrial Revolution.


Another popular concept explored in the Romantic period was color. Composers began viewing the orchestra as a palette that could depict an array of exotic scenes.
A sub-movement within the Romantic era is Impressionism. Similar to Impressionist painters like Monet, composers attempted to imprint an impression on the listener. For example, Erik Satie wrote a series of compositions called “furniture music,” which was the first time someone wrote music intended to be in the background.

, Music from the end of the Romantic period, around 1915, into the 20th century is considered modern classical music. Modern music is exemplified by various moods of extreme. Since the history of music styles are so vast, composers of this era attempted to break new grounds with their compositions.


For example, Igor Stravinsky broke new grounds by composing a ballet about a pagan myth. The premiere nearly caused a riot from the audience.
The modern movement also birthed experimental music with such figures like John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

, Take a look at the various movements and determine if you can name a piece of music or composer from each period. A good way to practice learning the different eras is by reading about the time period while listening to a piece of music from that movement. For music students, it is required to identify a piece of music based off a sound clip. Here are some pieces that accompany each time era:


Early classical music is best heard in the Gregorian Chants and other choral music.
Baroque music has two heavyweights: Bach and Handel. Bach’s cello suite no.1 in G might be his most recognizable.
The classical period has several popular composers. Popular pieces from this era include Mozart’s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik or Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9.For the Romantic era, listen to Liszt’s Liebestraum or Chopin’s Etude Opus 25.
Modern music is so vast, but some key pieces are Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and John Cage’s 4’33.

Pinpoint the genre.,
Look into the lyrics.,
Educate yourself in formal notation.Formal notation is the way musicians describe the objective details of music accurately to their fellow players.,
List the musicians involved.",How to Describe a Song1," Genres categorize music within overarching umbrellas; large amounts of music tied together via a common tone or structural approach, but usually both.Referring to genre is the easiest way you can describe music to someone. Genres may refer primarily to the sound, but they come with a lot of preconceptions, including lyrical content and artistic intention. If the song you're trying to describe fits what you know of the genre, the genre-tag will become that much more useful to you.


In modern music, it is common for musical groups to draw from two or more genres to develop a unique character of their own. Calling a band 'eclectic' is a decent start if they're playing in many different genres. Try to keep your genre tags limited to one or two however; anything more and you'll just end up confusing whomever you're talking to.
The Beatles, for instance, incorporate many styles, but they're best seen as pop. Led Zeppelin could be considered anything from progressive to blues or metal, but they're arguably best pegged as bluesy hard rock.
For example, you might say: ""Deathspell Omega's ""Obombration"" is an interesting song for the band. It has the atmosphere of orthodox black metal, but the instruments used are largely orchestral, making it sound like very dark classical music."";
, The majority of songs you'll hear are quite clear in their topics. Many pop songs, for example, concern romantic encounters the singer has had. If the song's meaning isn't already apparent to you, do some research online to learn what the song is about. Many songs-- especially classics-- will have some info as to the story behind them. Using this story alongside your description will help to specify the character of the song.


For example, you might say: ""Pink Floyd's ""Dogs"" tells a story of dogs being aggressive in their nature, but it's also a cynical commentary on the 'dog eat dog' mentality in modern society. This cynical undertone has a big effect on the song's atmosphere.""

, It takes years to develop a masterful understanding of notation, but having a general idea as to the tools musicians use to communicate with one another will help out a lot.


The 'key' of a song refers to the chords and set of notes it predominantly uses. A 'minor key', for instance, tends to sound inherently sad, while a 'major key' is often uplifting.
Tempo refers to the speed of the music, or the pace of the beat.

, Giving an outline of the particular people involved in the making of the music is most important in performance-based styles of music, like jazz. For popular forms of music, telling someone which singer(s) are involved will give them the best idea as to the sound of the song. Many of the best-known singers have very distinctive vocal qualities, and merely giving a name may give the person you're talking to a clearer idea what to expect in a song.


For example: ""Miles Davis In A Silent Way is a wonderful album, and I think a good part of it is owed to the fact that Chick Corea and John McLaughlin (among others) took part in it. If you listen close, you can hear their personalities mingling in with Davis' own.""

"
"
Listen to the music intently.,
Read music reviews.,
Try to visualize the music.,
Employ metaphors and poetic language.Music itself is an intensely personal, creative venture with poetry inherent to its very nature.,
Compare the song to other songs you've heard.",How to Describe a Song2," Even moreso than a formal analysis of music getting a full emotional reaction requires you really invest yourself in listening. Find a time and place you won't likely be distracted, and put on the song. Let yourself focus in on the mood of the song. Listen carefully to the lyrics if there are any. While you're listening to the music, try to figure out how the artist was feeling when he wrote the song. Giving your heart and mind over to the music will make it a lot easier to communicate your own personal response to the material.Listening with headphones is usually the preferable mode of listening intently; it helps to block out all external sound, and you'll be able to pick details out of the mix more clearly.

, Music journalists and reviewers make it their business to describe music in ways that sound fiercely descriptive and appealing-- or unappealing. Music reviews have become a very helpful outlet in the internet age, and you can usually read many reviews about the most obscure albums. Reading some of them may give you a better understanding how to describe music yourself. The webzine Pitchfork is often recommended in this respect, but the pompous style of writing is not for everyone. More specialized and underground outlets like Heathen Harvest Periodical or Prog Sphere Magazine may offer better examples of descriptive writing.Music reviews are also found in print form. Newspapers will often include them alongside film reviews. You can also buy music books that will focus specifically on a band, scene or genre.

, Actively visualizing the music you are listening to ties in with intent focus. If you're looking for interesting ways of describing the music, it's a good idea to meditate and imagine the music scoring a scene to an imagined film inside your head. The process of actively visualizing music may seem obtuse at first if you're not used to it, but it can otherwise be a great way of appreciating music without distractions.


For example: If the music is sad, you might visualize rain or images of death and loss. If the music is upbeat, you might think of a car racing down a highway. If the music is gentle, it may bring to mind the image of kittens nestling in a handknit blanket. No interpretation is wrong; if you are sincerely getting an image in your head because of the music, it must be for a good reason.

, It makes sense that descriptions of music can and should be poetic as well. If someone is emotionally rapt by a piece of music, they will often explain their feelings in terms of a metaphor. Metaphors and other descriptive poetic devices (like similes) will enable you to describe the emotional experience of the music.For a metaphor, you might say: Deathspell Omega's Paracletus is an absolute whirlwind of calculated madness.
For a simile, you might say: Anton Bruckner's first symphony sounds like going to an evening gala at the height of 19th-century Prussia.

, If you are hearing a song that's left a particular impression on you, it's likely you can compare experiencing the music to something else you've heard in the past. Comparing music with other music is a solid way to develop strong associations and expectations in the other person's mind. Comparing music can be done in objective (genre, tempo, musicians, etc.) or subjective (mood, tone, etc.) terms.For example: ""Dream Theater's ""A Change of Seasons"" reminds me quite a bit of Yes' ""Close to the Edge"" in terms of its sprawling design, but it's obviously quite a bit darker and heavier in comparison.""

Pick a few notes in the same scale.,
Now play the best solo anyone has ever heard.

",How to Write a Guitar or Bass Solo," If you do not know how to do this, then you can just do it by ear, but it is easier if you know which fret is an A, and which one is a F-Sharp. To start of, know that the standard tuning is from high to low: E, A, D, G.;
, If you come across A-Flat twice, list it in the scale. Only write notes in this scale unless you know what you are doing., Should it be fast? Slow? Technical? Ask yourself as many question as you need to determine what you want. Write notes out that you determined in the scale. Try to follow an up, or down pattern for a few notes and then change it up. For example: A, B, C, B, D, A, C, A.,


Do this with a pencil (not a pen) and a piece of paper.

, Work with every note like this for ten minutes.

, Now pick out which 10 of the notes stand out to you the most and play around with those in any order. Do this for ten minutes.

, Now pick the top 8 notes that stood out to you from those 10 notes. Take those notes and play around with them for at least 15 minutes.

, Hopefully now your mind and fingers will be used to the randomness. Take the notes and try to put them together like a puzzle. Spend 10 minutes on this.

, The ""pictures"" are on it. Now it's time to give those pictures some color. Understand hammer-ons, pull-offs, tremolo, tremolo picking, vibrato, and sliding.

, Once you are done... Great! Now there is ""paint"" on the puzzle. But it needs to be more interesting. How about shades, tints, and blends!

, You have the choice of either getting a whammy bar or a whammy bar pedal. Either will change the pitch of the notes. The pitch can rise into the sky or fall down to the depths of the ocean., A ""dive bomb"" effect occurs when you push the whammy bar down to where it touches the guitar. The opposite effect occurs when you pull the whammy bar up to where the handle is at a 75* angle. (It's already at a 50* angle.) Practice these effects. One simple effect you can use at the end of a song is to move the neck of the guitar/bass up and down. That makes a ""wavy"" sound. You don't need a whammy bar for this.

, Now the puzzle is complete and very interesting. Maybe the ""drawing"" is a little misshapen; maybe the ""paint"" got a little out of the lines. So fix it.

, Form a short, four-to-five-note melody and repeat it over and over, experimenting by adding or subtracting notes. For example, if you start with the melody E B D E G E, you could expand it to E B D E G E D E D C A.

, Kurt used power chords for the most part. Occasionally arpeggios and simple single note riffs were used, but they didn't follow a scale. Kurt didn't use scales.,


For riffs like those in Bleach, focus on heavy, dark sounding riffs. Hardcore punk was a big influence to Nirvana during the early years.
For Nevermind or In Utero, focus more on pop influences. Kurt based Nevermind on Sonic Youth's Goo album.

, While solos can be tricky to write, they're often worth it if done well.


Solos like those in Bleach: again, focus on heavier sounding solos. A lot of Kurt's solos during this era were noise and, as Butch Vig said, Kurt ""strangling his guitar."" so focus on these aspects and listen to Bleach for help.
For Nevermind or In Utero, again, more pop influenced, not as heavy. These should be more upbeat and more musical. If you want, copy the vocal melody like on ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" or ""Come As You Are"".

See if you can create a line or phrase that seems to answer an idea or question in your “Possibles” list.

, Aim for a general topic or phrase and don’t worry about being overly creative or descriptive. The title will likely change as you compose the song, but a working title will help you focus on a main theme or idea.

, The most common contemporary song structure is: verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus. Most listeners like this song form because it is catchy due to repetition, but varied enough to be engaging and interesting.A verse in a song has the same melody but different lyrics. The verse paints a picture of a scene, a situation, an emotion, and/or the subject(s) in the song.
The chorus usually appears three or four times throughout the song, depending on how long the song is, and the lyric and melody remain the same each time it recurs. The chorus lyrics should sum up the heart of the song or the overall message. The title of the song may also appear in the chorus.
The bridge has a different melody, lyrics, and chord progression from a verse or chorus. It provides a break from the repetition of the verse and chorus. The lyrics in a bridge often provide an insight or revealing moment. The bridge can also add on to or extend an idea or thought in the verse or chorus.

, Often, the question to be answered in a song is: “What does this feel like?” or “How am I feeling?”Don’t forget to also try to integrate the title of the song in the chorus.
For example, in the popular Bruno Mars song “Treasure”, he focuses on how special and “treasured” the girl is to him. In the chorus, he sings: “Treasure, that is what you are/ Honey you're my golden star/ You know you can make my wish come true/ If you let me treasure you/ If you let me treasure you.”In the chorus, Mars reinforces the main idea of the song with other adjectives that play off of a treasure, such as “golden star”, while also keeping the lines short and to the point, as well as including the title of the song.

, If you’re focusing on the physical beauty of a girl, describe this in the chorus. If you’re focusing more on your experiences with a girl or your desires for a girl, be sure to sum up these feelings in the chorus.


If we use Mars’ “Treasure” as an example again, he makes several direct statements in the chorus of the song, such as “that is what you are”, “you know you can make my wish come true” and “if you let me treasure you.” In these phrases, he directly addresses the object of affections and tells her exactly how he feels.

, Structure your verses around the ideas in your chorus lyrics. Try to answer the question you picked or idea you’re focusing on in an open, honest way, and avoid formal or complicated language.For example, in Mars’ “Treasure”, the first verse is: “Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby/ I got to tell you a little something about yourself/ You’re wonderful, flawless oh you’re sexy lady/ But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else.”In this verse, Mars starts the conversation with the girl by telling her to give him her attention because he has something to tell her. He then tells her he think she’s “wonderful” “flawless” and “sexy”, but notes she doesn’t seem to realize how valuable she is (“wanna be someone else”). So, this verse ties into the idea of treasuring her, or seeing her worth and valuing that. It’s a good introduction to the main idea of the song and lets the listener know what they’re in store for.

, To create a good melody, you need good pitch, phrasing, and rhythm. When you talk, you are likely already displaying all of these elements. But in a song, these elements are exaggerated and there is more repetition. So singing the lyrics will help you find a melody that is suitable for a song.Use the melodic element of speech to give your songs added emotional impact. Changing the pitch in your voice so it goes up at the end of a question or flattens out when you’re being sarcastic will add emotion to the song.In most songs, the chorus will sound more urgent than the verses, and it will use a higher note range. So try to raise the pitch of your voice when singing the chorus.
In Mars’ “Treasure”, he adds in an “Oh whoa-oh-oh” before the bridge to give the song a sense of urgency and melody.Don’t be afraid to add “ohs” or “ahs” to the chorus or bridge to add emotional impact.

, Strumming along to a guitar or playing a piano or keyboard as you sing your lyrics will help you create chords and chord progression.Using an instrument to compose the song will also help you find the right pitch for the melodies in the song.
If you don’t play an instrument, ask a friend who does to play along as you compose.
If you’d like to learn how to play chords on a guitar or piano, there are several learning methods available online., This will ensure you are comfortable playing the song live and can pour all your feelings and emotion into your performance.

, Depending on how personal the song is, it’s always best to get an outside opinion of your creative work.


Try to show the song to someone who is close to the girl you are interested in, or who knows her well and can give you specific feedback about whether or not she would appreciate it.

, Maybe you want to demonstrate a very public display of affection by performing the song spontaneously in a public place or perhaps you’re more into the idea of an intimate performance in a romantic setting. Whichever way you decide to present the song, make sure you do so confidently, honestly, and full of feeling.

Put the music and Lyrics together.",How to Write a Song With Music and Lyrics," Writing about your own experiences is always the best way to go, because you'll know how the song should feel. If you want your song to tell a story, think about each part of that story and how it feels. Make sure the story isn't too complicated, because it will be hard to understand.;
, If it is a sad song, it should normally be slow. Happy songs don't have to be fast, but they are normally higher and always in the major key. If it is a dark song, it will sound great in the minor key. You can even add some chords that clash if they sound appropriate to the mood of the song and you know what you are doing. If you don't have very much musical experience, experiment and see what sound you think reflects how your song should make listeners feel.

, Keep trying until you find one that is best for your song. Then see if you can find chords that go well with your melody. It won't sound as impressive if it doesn't have some chords. If putting the two together is too hard, you could just sing the melody and only play the chords. A lot of songs are like this and they sound lovely. If you don't have a piano, you can do this with another instrument or skip this step. Just plan out a melody or chorus for your song.

, Make sure it is the kind of melody that will sound good with words, because some melodies sound good on an instrument but not with lyrics.

, Sing each line as your write it down making sure it has the right amount of syllables. You don't always have to rhyme but some here and there sound good, as long as your rhymes make sense and don't sound like you only put them there because you couldn't think of anything better that rhymed. Repeating a stanza a few times can be nice and it helps people recognize your song faster and be able to sing it.

, Touch up anything that sounds unsatisfactory. Now you have yourself a good song that came from the heart.

Cope with difficult passages.",How to Sight Sing," You may have heard singers sing ascending scales like this: Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. (If you haven't, listen to an example to learn the intervals between notes.) ""Do"" is always assigned to the ""tonic"" or ""root note"" of the scale, such as the C in the C major scale or G in a G major scale. By singing the solfege scale ascending from here, you will hit each note in that scale.


Some singers reinforce the different syllables by changing hand shape as well. This is optional.
A minority of singers prefer other systems, such as ""1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1."";
, This is explained here so you can refer to the solfege system directly above, but you may want to wait until you've got plenty of practice with the solfege system before you try this. In minor scales (which exist in several forms), some of the intervals between notes are lowered from a whole step (such as from C to D) down to a half step (C to C♯). In solfege, these notes halfway between certain intervals are indicated by changing the vowel sound in the solfege syllable. Here are some examples, with the lowered notes in bold:Natural minor: do re me fa sol le te do
Harmonic minor: do re me fa sol le ti do
Melodic minor, ascending: do re me fa sol la ti do
Melodic minor, descending: do te le sol fa me re do
The chromatic scale, which goes up only in half steps, includes some syllables that are rarely used in songs. Learning it is not recommended until you are comfortable at sight-singing.
Knowing these can help you sight-sing a note in the sheet music that's a half step up or down from the scale you are singing in. These are marked with a sharp symbol ♯ (half step up) or a flat symbol♭(half step down).

, Learning solfege is tough, especially without a music teacher to guide you. Practice as often as you can by choosing your favorite songs and trying to identify the ""tonic note"" of the piece, which you will sing as Do, then sing the entire song in solfege. There are a few ways to find the tonic note:


When a note in the song feels like it is ""coming home"" or reaching a conclusion, this is often the tonic note. Songs often end on this note.
Try to play the melody on the piano, while listening to the song. Turn off the music and attempt to sing ""Do Re Mi..."" while using only the piano keys used for the song. Keep trying different notes for ""Do"" until you succeed.
If you hear an abrupt shift in the emotional tone of the melody, it may have changed keys. Focus on just one section at a time, since changing your ""Do"" note mid-song can be very tricky for beginners.

, It is possible to start from the first note on the page and count the number of spaces and lines up or down to the next note. Learning to read music is a much more efficient way to go about this, and will let you sight-sing faster and smoother. You can start by memorizing the mnemonics below, but to get it to sink in you'll need daily practice, perhaps with an online note recognition tool.


In the treble clef 𝄞, remember the lines from bottom to top by repeating Every Good Boy Does Fine. The spaces between them spell FACE.
In the bass clef 𝄢, remember the lines from bottom to top with Good Boys Do Fine Always. And for the spaces between them: All Cows Eat Grass.

, Play C on a piano, or use a metronome with a pitch function that produces C. Practice singing up or down the scale to find a different note. This is the process you'll use to find the starting note of a song.


If you want to train perfect pitch, you can try to find a song you know by heart that begins with C, and use it as a baseline. Keep in mind that people often start singing a song in a different key each time, so test yourself with a piano to make sure you can start on the right pitch each time.

, The most important skill for sight-singing is the ability to jump from one note to another without making a mistake, even if the two notes are nowhere near each other in the scale. Incorporate solfege exercises like the following into your daily practice routine:


(low)Do Re Do Mi Do Fa Do So Do La Do Ti Do (high)Do
Sing a song you know by heart using solfege. Slow down and repeat as necessary until you can sing the whole song using the right syllables. (It helps to sing the solfege scale in the right key a couple times before you begin.)

, One way to do this is to subdivide while listening to a song or reading sheet music. Clap to the beat of the song, but divide each beat into subsections, chanting aloud ""1–2"" or ""1-2-3-4"" between each clap.

, Sight singing is a tough skill, and it requires a great deal of practice to get to the point where you can comfortably sing any sheet music that comes your way. Search online or in libraries for sheet music of unfamiliar songs, attempt to sing them, then check whether you got it right by finding a recording online. Repeat this daily if possible.


Sing it with solfege first, then with the lyrics if there are any.
Make sure the sheet music is written for your vocal range.

, At the beginning of the sheet music, next to the clef sign, sharp ♯ and flat♭signs make up the ""key signature."" These tricks will help you memorize what each key signature looks like:


If there are no sharps or flats next to the clef, the scale is C major, so C will be Do for this song.
The rightmost sharp in the key signature is Ti on the solfege scale. Go up one half step (a space or line) and you'll get the root note which the scale is named for, and which you can think of as Do. Alternatively, use this mnemonic to identify the scale by how many sharps there are (starting at one sharp): Green Day And Elvis Buy Four Cats
The rightmost flat in the key signature is Fa, and the flat to its left is the root note Do. Identify the scale by the number of flats there are (starting at one flat): Fat Boys Eat Apples During Geometry Class

, Unless you have perfect pitch, you'll need to listen to the root tone. This is always the note in the name of the key signature, so when you're singing a song written in A, you'll want to listen to an A. You can use a piano, a metronome with a pitch function, a tuning fork, or pitch software on a phone app or website.

, Using the root note as Do, sing the solfege scale up and down once or twice to get a feel for the notes you'll be singing. Remember to use the minor solfege syllables for minor scales.

, The vertical bar lines on sheet music will help you detect the beat of the music. Tap this onto your leg with your fingers if it helps you get a sense of it. There may also be a tempo mark telling you how fast to sing, such as ""90"" for 90 beats per minute. Feel free to sing it slower if you need to, unless you are being accompanied.


Italian words are often used as tempo descriptions as well, such as andante for a ""walking pace"" of approximately 90 beats per minute. Allegro for fast and adagio for slow are two of the most common.

, If you are singing alone, especially when you are practicing, slow down slightly when you're having trouble with a passage. If you are being accompanied or singing in a group, lower the volume instead while you're struggling, but keep a confident, clear tone. As you train your sight-singing and get a feel for the song you are singing, even your guesses will be right more and more often.

Remember, that not all duets are between opposite sexes, nor are they all love songs.,

Prompt your partner with a nod, or a glance, or you may even want to open your palms with a finger pointing towards them.",How to Sing a Duet," A duet is when any two people sing and share a song together, They could be having a humorous time together, or more serious. Make sure that each have solo parts. Unless you try to freestyle harmonize, layer or echo lyrics, do not clash roles, trip up lines, or 'cross lanes'. That means that if you sing lower than your partner, remain there. The limit would be if you are both singing the same note. Stay consistent.;
, If you are not doing karaoke, and you do know the lyrics, you can lip-sync lyrics while not singing to make sure you can prompt your partner if he forget the words or for you to keep track of when to join in.

Untrained singers often breathe from too high in their chest, compress their throat as they sing, and adopt poor posture that affects their voice. Whenever you sing, stand up straight, place your feet shoulder width apart, and roll back your shoulders. Keep your chin straight and breathe from your diaphragm, low in your torso.;
, Start with a simple song you know by heart. Listen to the tune intently to make sure you are singing it correctly; most people adopt minor changes without realizing it. Identify the starting note of the song, and which key the song is in. Keep practicing until you can sing the song all the way through without switching keys.


Assuming you do not have perfect pitch, use a pitch pipe to get you started on the first note.

, Singers can broadly be categorized into two groups, the trained professional and the talented amateur. Nearly all trained singers can immediately tell when someone has been trained, simply from the pitch, phonation and projection of the singer. Singing a cappella requires vocal flexibility, durability, and a good ear. Professional voice training will help you improve these skills.

, Joining a good choir will rapidly improve your voice, pitching, ear, and sight-singing. In addition, it builds the maturity and professionalism needed to sing as part of a group. If you don't have any choral experience, pay particular attention to these skills:


Learn to sight sing or pitch off the singer who has the solo or melody. Using your own memory or perfect pitch can disrupt the group.
Support the group by blending in with other singers. Singing too loudly, trilling, or singing with a titled larynx, or singing in thick folds while the choir is in thin folds can all cause issues if you drown out the rest of the group.

, Many singers overlook this, but getting performance experience both as a part of an ensemble and as a soloist is very important. Learning to overcome stage fright and stress is vital for any performer.


Stage fright can cause your false vocal cords to constrict. If not addressed, this can make your voice muddy, grainy, breathy, or strained, and could lead to fatigue and damage.
Pace yourself in performances. If your voice is easily fatigued, sing glottal. If the performance involves dancing, try to avoid running out of air.
It's significantly easier to overcome nerves in a group, another reason why choir performances are a good idea.

, Singing too loudly is a common mistake in a cappella. Remember your role in the group. At any moment, only one or two voices are the melody. These should come across loud and clear, enough so that they have some flexibility to reduce volume for effect. The other singers are the equivalent of percussion and background instruments, and are there to harmonize and keep the rhythm.


Of course, a bass singer may drop the percussion part for a short solo or a bridge. Understand when projection is appropriate, and when to keep it quiet.
Many a cappella groups have set parts, often a soprano/meso soprano part, an alto part, a tenor part, a bass part, and perhaps a beat boxer. Baritone parts, while beautiful, are very rare, as tenors and basses can often sing the baritone parts. Depending on your range, you may be able to choose a part each song, rather than always getting one part.

, You'll need a good ear and a confident tone, two attributes that come with plenty of practice. Avoid sliding down or swooping up to a note, a bad habit which is particularly dangerous a cappella. Also make sure you do not drift downward in pitch as the song progresses, another common mistake.


Keeping a consistent rhythm is important as well. Avoid changing tempo without thinking, and respect the rests.

, Since a cappella is all voice, you'll be singing more than you would in a typical performance. You'll need the vocal durability to keep this up the whole way. You should also be ready for on-the-fly adjustments, as many a cappella groups like to switch up the tempo, dynamics, and parts.


Your voice will be much more durable if you learn proper singing techniques.

, Many performing a cappella groups write their own arrangements, and some gigs and competitions require it. You'll need to understand how to construct pleasing harmonies.


If you're not yet able to recognize and sing 3rds, 5ths, and other intervals, practice singing scales with these intervals. For example, when singing any scale, sing 1,3,1,3,1, then go a semitone up and repeat.

, Many a cappella arrangements require certain singers to sing with extended ranges, especially tenors, sopranos and altos. Even if you are able to sing all the notes in a song's range, you may need additional practice to keep the sound fluid and soft. Tenors in particular may need practice flipping between modal and falsetto registers.

, Respect the other singers involved, including the effort they go through to fit the a cappella group into their schedule. When you're late to a rehearsal, you're letting everyone down and wasting their time. Keep a professional, mature attitude, and don't expect to always be the center of attention.

, Solo and a cappella delivery are very different. If you incorporate dance routines or gestures into your performance, make sure everyone is on the same page. The performance just doesn't work if one member is rocking the upbeat 70's moves, while another looks like they're performing a Whitney Houston ballad.

, It is possible to be a solo a cappella singer, by recording yourself singing each part. Most singers are more interested in group singing, but this could be a way to become more familiar with the style while you're looking for an opportunity.

, Find these by scouring the internet, forming connections with other singers, and looking in local newspapers. Remember to be safe about where you audition, and avoid offers that look too good to be true.

, This document should outline past experience, the styles and schools you trained in, any special programs or vocal health workshops you've attended, and any groups or choirs you've been a part of. You may also include any musical study you did, how many minutes of repertoire you have, and so forth.

, Make sure you know your part as well as you possibly can. If you get to choose your audition piece, bring sheet music with you so the people judging you can follow along and see whether you're singing it accurately. If the audition requires you to sing a certain part in a certain arrangement, make sure you can stick to your part even in a group, as this may be how they test you.


Get plenty of rest and water in the days prior to the audition.
Make sure you're well dressed and well groomed. Dress for the part and for the general vibe of the group, not just based on what flatter you personally.
Confidence is key. Smile, look the group members in the eye and tell them loudly and clearly your name, what you'll sing and who the song is by. Hand them the music and your ""musical CV,"" stand up straight, and sing with confidence.

, If there are no suitable a cappella groups in your area, consider forming your own. Here are the first steps:


Put together a demo pack about yourself. This can include solo pieces with your choir, a recording over a backing track, or a snippet from a singing recital. Make singers feel like it would be great to work with you.
Market, market, market. Tell your singer friends, and ask them to tell their friends to. If you're in a choir, invite anyone you think would be a good fit. Advertise your contact details.
Close the entries at a certain date, and hold yourself to that cut off date with an iron grip.

, Once your entries are in, narrow them down to the people you think deserve an audition. Don't make the mistake of going too easy on people out of fear that you won't find enough members. It's better to put out a second call than to clog the auditions with people you can't accept.


Make sure you know the range of each person auditioning in advance.

, Here's an example of how an audition could go:


Hit a few keys on the piano within the singer's range, or sing a few notes on your own, and ask them to pitch them back to you. A good singer should be able to hit the notes without sliding into them.
Ask the singer to sing a short snippet of a song to you.
Ask whether the singer has perfect pitch. Someone with perfect pitch can be great for providing starting pitches at live gigs, but the singer must be able to ignore it and stick to the group when the group goes slightly off-key.

, Diversity is key. Just as there are many different instruments in an orchestra, you'll need different vocal ranges. A spread of voices ranging from bass to soprano unlocks many more arrangements than a few voices near the same range. The size of the group is up to you: a talented group can succeed with five singers, but you could form a large a cappella choir if that's what you're interested in.


A beat boxer can be very useful to keep rhythm.
You may need to run additional ads or word-of-mouth campaigns to fill the final position or two. Be as specific as possible for these, for instance ""Seeking a leggiero tenor with a range of at least B flat1- B7'.""

, Assume that you followed all the steps above and your group is dedicated, rehearsals should run smoothly. The real challenge is honing your performance, and finding opportunities to try it. Gigging in a cappella is a little different than the pub and restaurant sets where many other musicians start out, as light choral-inspired music is not usually in demand there. You can expect to sing for free for a while to build up your name recognition. Here are a few places to consider volunteering (or to look for paid work, if you can get it):


Caroling for churches, hospitals and nursing homes
Weddings and other events
Busking and fundraisers
Sing back-up vocals for another performer

, To make it big, your songs must immediately ring a bell in people's minds. You want the audience to remember your faces, appreciate your voices, and get your songs stuck in their heads. Set yourself apart with dancing, dress, or an unusual singing style. You can take this nearly to the pantomime level — perhaps not as far as the sock-waving ""Sock-A-Pella"" group in Pitch Perfect, but getting close to it.

, Your sound is your main priority, but spend effort on other visual aspects such as facial expressions and choreography. A giant smile during a blues song can make the experience off-kilter. All dancing should be well-practiced and fit the song's theme — no vogue dancing during a quiet heartbreak song.

Use improvised syllables and sounds to scat over instrumental tracks.,
Practice ""call and responses"" with scat singers and instrumental lines.,
Start with simple, rhythmic syllables, focusing on melody instead of new sounds.,
Accent, modulate, and have fun with your syllables.,
Practice with a metronome or an instrumental track to ensure you stay on time.",How to Scat1," Scatting is the act of turning your voice into improvisation instrument, removing real words and just focusing on noise, melody, sound, and tone. As such, everyone can scat immediately, even if it feels weird or uncomfortable. Just start making noises that sound great over the song your hearing.


Listen to some classic scat singers for early inspiration. ""Perdido"" by Sarah Vaughan, ""Them There Eyes"" by Ella Fitzgerald, and Louis Armstrong's ""Heebie Jeebies"" are all incredible early examples.
Scatting is generally a jazz skill, but artists like Scatman and Bobby McFerrin have expanded it to other genres in modern times.;
, You need to get used to your voice not as a speaking mechanism but as an instrument. As you first start, limit yourself to copying your favorite singers. Play a couple bars of scat singing, then try to repeat it back verbatim to start learning sounds, tricks, and melody construction.


The blues, with simple chords and built-in call and response, is a great place for beginners to begin. Try out ""Centerpiece"" by Lambert, Hendricks & Ross.Try mimicking actual sung lyrics, but don't use the words. Practice capturing the singer's melody with random syllables instead of words to get used to scat.
As you improve, start copying guitar, horn, and other lines with your mouth, using whatever syllables come to mind to replicate the sound. There is no noise, when scatting, that is off limits!

, As you begin improvising your own scatted lines, start with a couple of ""accepted"" scat words and syllables. Simple, percussive noises are the easiest way to start, using sounds like ""bob,"" ""beep,"" ""ski,"" ""do,"" etc. Remember that you're not trying to say anything. You're playing with musical notes, not words.The musical scale made famous in ""The Sound of Music"" is a great place to start: do, rey, mi, fah, soh, la, ti, do!

, Scatting is about using your whole body to make noises and sounds, improvising more than just syllables. As you improve and get more and more used to scatting, start playing with the following variables to expand your musical vocabulary as you sing.



Volume-- draw the audience in by going quieter, then build back up to a louder crescendo with bigger, louder syllables.

Tone-- how do you sound with you chin tucked in? You chest puffed out? How does the shape of your mouth change the sound of your singing?

Pitch-- perhaps the most important, pitch is how high or low your notes go. As you get used to making up syllables on the spot, start working on varying pitch with each word. Songs get boring when they stay in the same pitch for too long -- give some melodic variety.

, Scatting is an intensely rhythmic art form -- you voice is both percussive (like a drum) and melodic (like a trumpet, piano, etc.). As such, you must be able to stay in time while you improvise, holding to the beat like any other instrument. While good singers should already feel comfortable with this, newbies must practice with a metronome or backing track to get used to staying on time at all times.Always start at a speed you can keep up with comfortably. While you can set any rhythm you want, most scat is over a 3/4 ""swing feel"" of jazz.
That said, practicing improvising syllables on the spot without music or metronome is still a valuable skill. You just need to train your ear so that you can snap to a backing band when the chance arises."

Write it out.,
Sing it over and over.,
Do something else.,
Meditate and draw.,
Try again.,
Rinse and repeat.",How to Sing a Sad Song Without Crying," Find a place to be alone. Sing through the song and don’t bottle up your feelings. Suppressing the urge to cry will just prolong your pain. Take the time to sing to yourself, being fully present in how you feel. Let the tears flow freely, and spend as much time doing this as you need. You may need a whole day, or even several days to get it all out. Treat the process with the same sincerity as you would a true grieving process. You deserve it! If you don’t invest time in releasing your intense feelings, they will continue bothering you when you perform.;
, Take a break from singing and just listen to the song. If you can access other recordings, listen to as many versions of the song as possible. If no recordings are available, record yourself singing it once and just listen to that recording. Embrace the emotions that come over you as you listen. As intense or time-consuming as this process may be, your reward will be a deep insight into your emotional self. This will not just help the tears subside; you will likely start to heal from serious pain you still carry from past experiences. This will aid you on your quest to greater resilience.

, Make sure you write about this valuable experience. Verbalize what you are feeling. Write down your thoughts and read them aloud to yourself. Feel free to share these thoughts with a trusted friend. Articulate what you’re feeling in the mirror. There is no such thing as coming to understand your feelings ""too much"", especially as a performer. Even if you think you are ""over it"" at this point, writing about your experience will help you preserve valuable insight for the future.

, Sing the song and allow your emotions to manifest themselves as they will. If you are still crying at this point, don't fret. The sting will lessen with time. In the meantime, you will learn how to sing through your crying. This skill will rescue you in emergencies when you get emotional during performance.

, If after cycling through these steps you still don’t feel better, do something else. Take out the trash. Go for a walk. Work out at the gym. Talk to a good friend. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Take a bubble bath. Do anything to get your mind off the song. A lively activity followed by relaxation could do wonders for you.

, When you're ready to sing the song again, take some time to imagine yourself doing so successfully. Close your eyes and imagine yourself performing the song. Visualize yourself doing so successfully. What do you sound like? What do you look like? What do you see around you? Take note of as many other details as you can. Act like a little kid and draw what you see. Let your right brain indulge in this sensory experience.

, By now you have let yourself cry it out, think deeply, take a break, and reflect about your experience. At this point, you have hopefully taken the edge off the pain you used to feel when singing this sad song. Go ahead. Sing it again and see what happens.

, If your attempt to sing still makes you bawl, don’t give up. Repeat these steps in whatever order helps you the most. If your efforts seem futile, don’t be shy about seeking professional help. There may be unresolved issues that need addressing—not just so you can get through the song, but so you can live a happier life.

Introduce a little rhythmic variety with duplets and triplets.,
Get a little swing behind your scatting.,
Learn the chord progressions to improvise like a jazz singer.,
Scat through your vocal solos to bridge classical singing and scatting.,
Get a little weird with tone, voice, and coloring.",How to Scat2," Once you feel comfortable with straightforward rhythms, it is time to start playing with shorter, but more complex, phrases. Duplets are simply two sounds thrown quickly together (""da-DA!""), and triplets are three sounds (""BEEP-da-BOP""). Instead of using straight quarter notes, where you have one sound per beat (1, 2, 3, 4), start stringing together these other phrases, leaving spaces in between them for a bouncy, swinging feel.


Hold some notes for three beats, cram 10 notes into two beats, and then leave some silence before launching back in. Rhythmic variety is about playing with the beat to create tension and surprise.
Alternating different types of rhythms is a great way to craft a complex, enjoyable scat solo without crazy notes or vocal range. Check out both Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, for example, on ""Stomping at the Savoy"" for a master class in rhythmic variation., An extension of rhythmic variation, this is when you transcend the ""written"" rhythm and get into the song with improvisational fervor. Most scatting is over a swing feel, where the 2nd and 4th beats are emphasized. Think of counting out your ""1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and"" with a little extra emphasis on these two beats. If you're going to hit a high note, or pause and come back in, make it on the swinging beats., Great scat singers, like any great soloist or musician, are locked into the underlying chords and melody of the song they sing over. They know when chord changes are coming, and adjust their melody right in time with the rest of the band. Listen to the song several times until the chords' feel natural, and you know exactly what your band is doing behind you. If you're hoping to play professionally, there are a few progressions you should know:



12-Bar Blues-- the most common progression in Western Music. No matter what the key, the chords will always change in the same order, meaning you can quickly scat to any 12-bar blues once you know the form.

I Got Rhythm -- known as the most covered chord progression in jazz, these changes are found in hundreds of songs, including popular music. Listen to versions from Duke Ellington to Django Reinhardt, If you are classically trained, there is no reason to abandon your skills just to start scatting. Run through your exercises, scales, and warm-ups with improvised syllables and sounds, and start putting your vocal scales to music. As a warm up, read music but ignore the lyrics, trying to sound out just the notes of vocal, brass, and woodwind sheet music., Listen to Ella Fitzgerald closing out ""Tenderly,"" a dear, calm, and loving song, with a deep and almost monstrous scat sound.And yet, it fits, complementing her smooth tone with an unexpected burst of passion and power. Scatting isn't about sounding ""human."" So, the further you can modulate and adjust your voice to sound more instrumental the better scat singer you'll become."

Their brains can be ""fine tuned"" to (correctly) hear the music from a very young age.;
, They will find that performing is fun. Most musical theater groups will perform in a low key and non-threatening way. A hardy round of applause will culminate in a desire to do more and to do better each time.

, Get a voice coach that knows how to work with children.

Market yourself in local newspapers.,
Put up flyers.,
Make business cards.,
Perform in public.",How to Promote Yourself As a Singer2," Newspapers, both online and in print, can be a valuable source of business. Find your local classifieds, and buy an ad advertising your services as a singer.


If you are offering a particular type of singing, you can look for a trade magazine. For example, if you are a wedding singer you can advertise in bridal magazines. If you sing children’s songs, you can advertise through a parenting magazine., Locate local clubs, coffee shops, venues, and other areas where potential clients might gather. Ask these businesses if you can hang a flyer advertising your services. Your flyers should identify you as a singer and provide your contact information, such as your phone number, email, and website.

, Create your own cards that list your name, contact information, and services. Keep these on you at all times. If you run into someone who might be interested in your services, hand them your card.

, The best way to gain visibility is to perform in public. Many singers are hired based on these performances. There are many ways you can perform for free without having to audition. These include:Open mic nights
Singing contests
Busking and street performances

"
"
Record a demo.,
Contact local venues.,
Reach out to promoters and producers.,
Respond to advertisements.,
Join a band.",How to Promote Yourself As a Singer3," Either an audio or video demo can help potential clients remember you as a singer. It also gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your singing abilities outside of an audition. You should store these demos in a variety of formats, including MP3, CD, and online streaming., Locate different places in your area that might be interested in singers. This includes performance halls, theaters, wedding venues, and clubs. Contact the owner or their promoter to see if they would be willing to let you perform. Different types of singers will have luck at different venues.


If you want to sing at clubs, you should print out a list of all local bars, clubs, and pubs. Contact each individually to see if they are interested in hiring a singer.If you want to become a wedding singer, you can contact local wedding planners or houses of worship, such as churches. They might be willing to refer you to their clients as a wedding singer for their events., Knowing people who work in the music industry can help you find gigs. Contact local studios, agencies, and production houses via email or phone. Let them know of your services, and ask if they would be willing to listen to a demo of yours. Let them know what type of music you specialize in and why they should be interested in you.For example, you can write an email that says, “Dear Mr. Smith, My name is Laura K, and I am a jazz singer. For five years, I have been wowing audiences in numerous venues across the city, and I am looking to enhance my singing career. I know your studio specializes in upcoming jazz acts. The Daily Standard has called me 'the next big thing in jazz.' I am including a link to my demos if you are interested. Please let me know if you would be willing to meet some time to discuss a potential partnership. Thank you.”

, Check local listings frequently to see what singing jobs are appearing. Apply to every job you can to increase your chances of success. Different advertisements may require different qualifications, but in general, you will want to have a resume and demo prepared to send out to potential clients.

, While you may want to work as a solo singer, you can increase your exposure by working with other musicians. Joining a band will not only help you gain more performance experience but it may make you more marketable to certain clients, who might be looking for backing musicians as well. Cooperating with other musicians will also help you network within your local music industry, potentially introducing you to producers, audio engineers, and promoters."
"
Ask clients for references.,
Pick appropriate sets of music.,
Provide a picture and a resume.",How to Promote Yourself As a Singer4," Once you have done a few gigs, you can ask your clients if they would be willing to write you a reference. List these references on your resume and provide them to your audience at the audition. You may even want to post these recommendations on your website in case the producers look you up on the internet., Before an audition, you will need to prepare a repertoire of songs to demonstrate your ability. You should have a wide range of songs that are appropriate for the type of singing that you want to do.


If you want to be a singer-songwriter, you should be able to sing popular hits from many different artists. You should also prepare songs you wrote to show your ability to compose.If you are a wedding singer, you will want to prepare different types of pop classics, love songs, and ballads as well as some common religious songs.If you are an opera singer, you will want to prepare arias in several languages.Musical theater performers should perform both classic theater standards and more recent Broadway hits., When you arrive at the audition, you will probably be competing against other singers. To make sure that you are remembered, you should bring a resume and a headshot with you. Give these to the producers before you start your audition. This will help them remember which singer you are, and it will give them a face to connect to the song."

Freewrite about whatever is on your mind.,
Find your favorite lines and build rhymes off of them.,
Develop a simple hook or chorus.,
Cut away any excess words, lines, and ideas until only the best stuff remains.,
Explore different types of rhymes.,
Think of your song like a small story.,
Stick to one idea or theme per song.,
Keep a notebook for writing down catchy rhyming lines, even if they don't form a song.",How to Write Your Own Lyrics1," Songs are about anything -- romance, lost shoes, politics, depression, euphoria, school, etc. -- so don't worry about writing the ""right"" thing and just start scribbling. If you don't even want to rhyme the lyrics just yet, that's totally fine. Right now, you're just collecting ideas and material to work with later. When thinking of ideas, try to:


Speak from the heart-- the things you really feel strongly about are usually the easiest to write lyrics for.
Don't judge or throw out your work yet -- this is the drafting stage, you'll be perfecting as you keep writing.;
, Say you're writing about school, and you have the line, ""Pushing pencils for a teacher no smarter than me."" Instead of trying to write the whole song at once, use this line to start building. All you need is one good line to get the ball rolling.


What would you rather be doing then school (""I'd rather be picking apples and swinging from trees"")?
How do you know the teacher is no smarter than you (""My paper on quantum physics only got me a C"")?
Most song verses are only 4-6 lines long, so this is already halfway to a verse!

, The hook is the repeated part of the song. It should be simple and fun, and usually tells people what the song is about. A good strategy for a hook is to just write two good rhymes and then repeat them, helping them get stuck in the listener's mind:


Choruses should be simple so that they are easy to remember.
Hooks don't even have to rhyme, as seen in the famous Rolling Stones hook: ""You can't always get what you want / But if you try sometimes you might find you what you need.""

, Songs are short and to the point, and the best songs don't waste a single syllable. When revising songs, think about:


Action words. Don't rely on ""is,"" ""love,"" and other commonly used words that everyone has heard. Try to use unique, precise words to convey the song's emotion.
Trimming. How can you re-write a line to make it shorter and more to the point?
Where are the lyrics vague? Instead of saying, ""we got in the car,"" say the type of car. Instead of talking about going to dinner, say what type of food you ate., There are a lot of ways to write a song, but almost all of them rhyme. The best practice for beginners is to understand the types of rhymes they have available and just work on simple, 2-4 line sections of rhyming lines. As you pull these together, a song will slowly be born:



Simple Rhyme: This is simply rhyming the last syllables of two lines, like ""I've just seen a face / I can't forget the time or place.""

Slant Rhyme: This is when the words don't technically rhyme, but they're sung in a way that makes them appear to rhyme. It is surprisingly common in all forms of songwriting. Examples include ""Nose"" and ""go,"" or ""orange"" and ""porridge.""Multi-syllabic rhyme: This uses multiple words or syllables, all of which rhyme. Check Big Daddy Kane on ""One Day,"" where he raps ""Ain’t no need for wondering who’s the man/ Staying looking right always an exclusive brand.""

, Even songs about a feeling or political idea can learn from storytelling techniques. You want an arc, or some change or progression. For example, think about how many love songs start with how downhearted or low the singer is before the girl/guy showed up. You get a journey through the romance, which makes the lyrics interesting.


If you're writing a full song, just think of each verse like a scene in a short movie. Since most songs have three verses, this simply means a beginning, middle, and end.

, Even Bob Dylan, one of the most convoluted and complicated lyricists of all time, knew that a good song must be grounded in one good idea. Looking simply at Dylan's catalog, the songwriter shows that the best songs explore one idea deeply, not a ton of ideas briefly:


""Blowin' in the Wind,"" which examines lots of issues, grounds itself with a simple question in the beginning of every verse -- how long can an injustice last before it must change?
""Tombstone Blues,"" one of Dylan's more expansive and out-there songs, is about a worry about what written and remembered on our tombstones after we die.

, Over time, however, these small bits will provide the springboards for entire songs, mixing and matching to help get started on a tune. Keeping a notebook or a phone note on you is the best way to capture ideas whenever the come up.


Prolific songwriter Paul Simon claims that all of his songs are composed of these loose pieces. As he finds some that match up, he slowly builds up lyrics to a song."
"
Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Get the right vocal tension.,
Start at a low volume.,
Record yourself singing.,
Work with a vocal coach.,
Drink plenty of warm drinks.,
Use a throat spray.,
Don't use any numbing products on your throat.,
Give your voice a chance to recover.",How to Sing Screamo," One of the most important things to learn when practicing any singing style is how to breath from your diaphragm.


This allows you to take in more oxygen, helping you to hold notes (or screams) for much longer and avoid getting out of breath while performing.
When you breathe from your diaphragm your stomach should expand as you inhale and contract when you exhale. Learning how to breathe correctly and naturally from your diaphragm takes practice.
Therefore you should start doing daily deep breathing exercises to improve your technique.;
, You will have different levels of tension in your vocal chords depending on how high or low you sing or scream.


For example, when you sing in a low voice your voice box will move down, making your vocal chord tension loose. When you sing in a high voice your voice box moves up, making your vocal chords tight.
Good screamo singing is all about control, and in order to have control you need to be aware of how vocal chord tension works and how you can manipulate it. Once you can control vocal tension, you will easily be able to move between high and low registers, even while screaming.
A good practice technique is to hum along with the sound of your car engine as you rev it up -- this warms up your vocal chords and allows you to practice moving from high to low registers., Many inexperienced screamo singers damage their voices by trying to scream too loudly -- however, one of the best kept secrets of successful singers is that they actually scream kind of quietly (as weird and contradictory as that sounds).


Don't try to scream at the top of your lungs on your first attempt, start at a low volume and as your voice gets stronger you can gradually increase the volume.
The beauty of screamo is that you can let the microphone do most of the work while you're performing. Even a ""quiet"" scream can rattle your audience's teeth when amplified by a good sound system.
You can also produce deeper sounds by cupping your hands around the microphone or by moving your mouth in specific ways as you sing. The best thing you can do is just to play around and experiment with it until you find a sound that you like., One of the best ways to improve your screaming technique is to record yourself singing and then watch it back later (no matter how awkward this might feel).


This can help you to pick up on things like poor posture or pitch-problems which you would never have been aware of otherwise.
Recording yourself allows you to really hear what you sound like and become aware of where you need to improve. The first step to improving your singing is to recognize your mistakes.

, Vocal coaching and screamo singing may not sound like two things that should go together, but screamers can actually benefit hugely from some professional training.


In fact, famous frontmen Randy Blythe, Corey Taylor and Robert Flynn have all improved their screaming technique and learned how to properly care for their voices thanks to professional vocal training.
A vocal coach will work with you to train and strengthen your voice. Even a couple of sessions can be worth the money, as your coach will teach you some breathing and warm-up exercises which you can practice at home.
Alternatively, you could try to get your hands on a book called ""The Zen of Screaming"" by Melissa Cross, which is pretty much the definitive guide to safe yet awesome-sounding screamo.

, It's a good idea to drink slightly warm water before rehearsing or performing.


The water helps to clear and lubricate the throat, while also keeping you hydrated. Warm water is better than cold water as it warms up your vocal chords.
You could also drink tea or coffee, but remember not to add any milk or cream. Dairy products coat the throat and increase phlegm production, making singing harder., Using a throat spray moisturizes your throat and helps to prevent your vocal chords from becoming damaged.


The most popular throat spray for singers is called ""Entertainer's Secret"" as it is a non-medicinal spray which relieves pain and irritation without numbing the throat.
It is available for purchase online.

, It's a bad idea to use any numbing sprays or lozenges, even if they help to relive vocal pain.


Pain is your body's way of telling you that something is wrong, so if you're numb to that pain you can do serious damage to your vocal chords and potentially ruin your voice without even realizing it.

, When singing screamo, one of the most important things to remember is not to push yourself too hard.


If you start to feel any pain, burning or irritation you should stop immediately and wait a couple of days for your voice to recover.
Trying to sing through the pain (however rock star that sounds) will only hurt your voice more and potentially cause irreversible damage.

"
Use the title of the song to set the mood, theme, or most important idea.,
Organize your lines into a rhyme scheme.,
Know the lyrical parts of a songs.,
Order your verses, choruses, and any bridge.,
Hum, whistle, strum, or play around on a piano to find the lyric's melody.",How to Write Your Own Lyrics2," The title of the song could be the chorus, or it could be some other word/phrase you think sums everything up. The title is the audience's first clue as to what the song is about or means, so take your time thinking of it.


That said, don't make a complicated title if you don't have to. Most songs use the chorus lines for a reason -- the chorus is already stating the main theme of the song., A good way to think about this is a rhyme diagram, where each letter symbolizes a rhyme. So, in an ABAB rhyme scheme, the first line (A) rhymes with the third (A) and the second line (B) rhymes with the fourth (B). There is also AABB, where lines just rhyme back to back. There are hundreds of ways to structure your rhymes, so start playing with your lines until you like the sound.


ABAB, or ""alternating rhyme"" is also common, and is easily written by splitting two long line into four ones.
Really technical writers might try to rhyme 4-6 lines in a row. This could be an AAAA BBBB rhyme scheme, or even AAAA AAAA if you're feeling extra complicated.
Some writers will try extending out a rhyme over multiple verses. Like an AAAB CCCB scheme. For an example, tune into ""Tombstone Blues.""

, There are, in general, three main sections of a song, not including an intro or outro (which can, of course, have lyrics). These three sections are mixed and matched to form the final song:



Choruses/Hooks are the repeated sections of the song, and the catchy area you hope everyone remembers the song by. They are usually short, and identically repeated.

Verses are generally the longest, most unique sections, where you expand on the ideas of the song and make your point, tell your story, etc.

Bridges, also called ""Middle 8s,"" are sections with different instrumentals. They often transition between a chorus or verse, or provide one section of differing texture and sound. This can be an instrumental solo, or cue a change in the mood or theme of the lyrics., Once you've got at least a chorus and a few verses written you can start thinking about how they alternate. You can even write a bridge to mix things up. The most typical song structure is intro/ verse / chorus / verse / chorus / bridge / chorus / outro, but there is nothing marrying you to this structure.


Another popular trick is to use multiple bridges to get from each verse to each chorus-- something like verse / bridge / chorus / verse / bridge / chorus / etc.
Bridges can also be instrumental breaks like guitar solos., Writing your own lyrics is only half the battle -- you need to know how to sing them, too. Even if you're a rapper, you still need to think about ""flow,"" or the pace and rhythm of your words. The best way to do this is to experiment, usually with an instrument of some sort, but you can even whistle or hum until something sounds good as well.


Paul McCartney of The Beatles famously found the melody to ""Yesterday"" by just repeating the words ""Scrambled Eggs"" until he found the notes. The lyrics were put in later."
"
Play with internal rhyme to give your lyrics a more melodic, sing-song quality.,
Rhyme lots of lines together for melodic, tight sections.,
Use poetic tools to add musicality without rhyme.,
Write a few metaphors and similes.,
Try to rhyme uncommon or inventive words.,
Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite.,
Ground your lyrics in real events, objects, and things.",How to Write Your Own Lyrics3," Internal rhyme is when you have smaller rhymes hidden in the middle of lines. You still have your normal end-line rhymes, just with a bit more flavor in the middle. For an example, check out this MF Doom line off ""Rhinestone Cowboy:"" ""Made of fine chrome alloy / find him on the grind he's a rhinestone cowboy.""


A good way to start with internal rhyme is to cut your lines in half, treating a rhyming couplet like 4 short lines instead of two longer ones.
Internal rhyme doesn't have to be regular, like regular rhyme. Even one or two in a song can have a wonderful effect.
You can even have internal rhyme in the same line, like another MF Doom line, ""never will he boost loose Philly's with the bar code."", Check out the Red Hot Chili Pepper's ""Californication,"" which rhymes a majority of lines with the title word, ""Californication."" Because so many of the lines rhyme with this one, singer Anthony Kiedis doesn't even need to rhyme the 1st and 3rd lines of each verse with anything -- giving him ""free"" syllables in each verse.


Another strategy is to rhyme the last line of each verse with the last line of every other verse. Check out ""Simple Twist of Fate.""

, Lyrics are poems put to music, and there is a lot to learn from the thousand-year-old art form. The following tricks can be slid into any lines to put a professional, deeply satisfying sheen on your songs:



Assonance is when you use the same vowel sound multiple times, such as ""awesome apple"" or ""evidently envious.""

Alliteration is just like assonance, but with consonants. Examples include ""slippery slope"" and ""washed out water polo women.""

, Not all songs need to have deeper meanings, and many shouldn't. Even worse, some songs try too hard to push deeper meaning and just end up confusing or meandering. That said, a well-placed metaphor can turn a song from a catchy tune to a powerful, personal, and impactful song:



Metaphor is when one thing is implied to stand in for another, like the song ""Firework"" by Katy Perry. She doesn't literally mean that ""you're a firework,"" she means that you contain a beautiful interior life waiting to explode into the world.

Simile is a more direct metaphor using the word ""like"" or ""as."" ""She was like a rose,"" for example, implies that she is beautiful, but may be dangerously thorny.

Synecdoche is when a small part represents a bigger whole. For example, ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" actually means that ""ideas are stronger than violence,"" not that pens literally beat up swords., The most impressive lyricists know that audiences have come to expect many of the rhymes in popular music -- ""we/she/he/me,"" ""love/dove,"" ""go/so/low/blow."" -- and they lose their power to pleasantly surprise us. The songwriters who stand the test of time continue to surprises us with longer and more intricate rhymes.


From ""Tombstone Blues:"" ""My advice is to not let the boys in"" // ""You will not die, it's not poison."" Very few other people have rhymed ""boys in"" with ""poison."", The best lyricists in the world know that a song rarely comes out perfectly in one go. Paul Simon even claims that it takes 50 sheets of paper, all with scribbled lyrics, for him to complete just one song.A good songwriter knows they must keep working on songs long after the first think of the idea.


Keep the old copies of your drafts, that way you can always return to an old version if you want to try something new and it doesn't sound great.
Use gigs and shows to test out new songs in lyrics. Where did they feel good and where was it awkward to sing through? What sections did people seem to like?, A song heavy on philosophy isn't a bad thing, but you need concrete images to help your audience visualize the ideas. Turning back to ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" note how Dylan couches each big societal woe in a real image -- a mountain crumbling, a man walking, a lonely dove, etc. -- so that the song places a literal image in the audience's head.Details, images,and specifics will almost always go better than broad generalities.

Keep your jaw relaxed and loose.",How to Project Your Voice when You're Singing," Facing the audience directly, versus turning your back towards them, while you sing makes it easier for you to be heard. Stand at an angle to ensure that your voice is heard as loudly and clearly as possible.Place your focus on the back of the auditorium or the room to help the sound of your voice carry by giving its range a focal point.Pick a person or an object in the crowd to help center your focus even further. Having someone in the audience to sing to is a helpful tactic in honing your focus. Choosing a tangible object as a focal point while you sing is equally effective.;
, If you don't, you won't physically be able to project. Stand up straight and keep your back and shoulders straight but relaxed.


A great way to perfect your posture is to imagine you’re a marionette puppet on stage and that a string is holding you upright by the top of your head by a puppet master.Your posture will be perfect but in a much more relaxed way.
Maintain straight posture, but do it in a way that it doesn’t place too much tension onto your body. You want your focus to be on singing, not on how uncomfortable your body feels in that position., This is where most of your power will come from. You can stand in a relaxed position where your feet are a few inches apart and one foot is slightly in front of the other.

, Singing from the throat can feel like second nature to an untrained singer, but it is actually the worst thing you can do for your vocal cords and is not the best way to try to project.


Support your voice through breath control. Pull breath from your diaphragm and abdomen muscles by breathing slowly and deeply into your belly. Regulate the amount of breath you use by releasing the breath in a controlled way versus exhaling quickly with force.While you sing, imagine that your mouth is a resonator guitar. Unlike typical acoustic guitars where the sound comes from the top of the guitar, sound leaves the resonator guitar through the bridge to the resonator, one or more of the spun metal cones.A resonator uses vibrations to project along the guitar’s mouth. Replicate that effect and pull your singing voice to the areas around your mouth where you feel the sound vibrating to project while you sing.

, Vocal placement is important for vocal projection and is essential to learning how to put your voice in the “forward” position it needs to be in for optimal projection.Find this by practicing humming exercises. Hum at the end of “mmm” sounds. This will help you feel vibrations and resonance in your face near your mouth and nasal area.Don’t pay attention to how you hear yourself in your head, instead focus on this area to learn where your voice will come from.This creates less force when you sing.

, It might seem counterproductive since a lot of emphasis is placed on warming up your vocals as much as possible before performances, but resting your voice is actually very important. Save conversation and excessive singing for after a performance to prepare your voice properly.Although vocal rest can be done before performances to rest the voice and remedy vocals that have been over-practiced, vocal rest is also useful after performances as well.Put yourself on vocal rest at least one full day per week, especially if you perform regularly and/or sing aggressively., Warming up your voice not only acts as vocal prep, but also acts as a vocal preserver as well. Do a couple scales so your voice will be able to handle the singing to come.


Warm ups should gradually build in intensity. Start gently and build slowly to volumes, efforts, and ranges of higher intensity.When the voice is warmed up, start with less vocally challenging songs to sing. That way you give your voice time to continue to warm up and stretch before moving on to more vocally demanding material., Just like warm ups are crucial to preserve the vocal cords before singing and performing, cooling down your voice afterwards is equally important. Cool down by doing gentle voice sounds and sighs to relax and de-stress your voice post-performance., Wake yourself up each morning with hot water with lemon. Carry a bottle of water around with you to rehydrate your throat as much as possible. Drink at least 64 ounces of water each day and avoid beverages that dry the vocals, like caffeinated drinks and alcohol.Drinking herb tea with lemon or honey daily can help maintain your vocal capabilities.Dry throat can also be prevented with the help of sleeping with a vaporizer or humidifier that adds moisture in the air., Coughing is how your body naturally rids itself of germs during times of infection, but it proves to shred your vocals. Take a cough suppressant or an herbal throat tea to help suppress coughs and relieve your throat., While it’s not necessary to avoid every concert, pub, or sporting event, just protect your singing voice by decreasing your volume and the length of time you spend using your voice., Projecting when you sing can potentially strain your vocals if not done correctly. Make sure that your throat and jaw are relaxed as you sing to reduce the possibility of strain.A tight throat is similar to the way your muscles constrict when you swallow. A loose, relaxed throat is how your throat feels when you yawn. Notice how even if you project a loud sound in that instance, it does not strain your vocals whatsoever. That’s the place you need to sing with.Practice vocal warm ups in front of the mirror to monitor and observe throat movements when you sing certain notes, especially with higher notes."

Maintain good singing posture.,
Stand still while you sing.,
Keep your throat open.,
Keep your chin down.,
Regulate your airflow.",How to Project Well While Singing in Your Whistle Register1," Always keep your head held high and your shoulders relaxed down and slightly back. Hold your chest out firmly. Set your feet shoulder width apart and lean slightly forward onto the balls of your feet. Keep your stomach muscles tight but ready to expand when you breathe deeply., Resist the temptation to sway, bounce, or walk around. Keep your hands still and don’t fidget. Focus all of your energy on your breathing and your voice. Moving and fidgeting detract from your concentration. Plant your feet and let your arms hang loosely by your sides.

, Work on opening your throat as much as possible to let lots of air pass from your lungs out through your mouth. You can open up your throat by dropping your jaw and larynx. Push your tongue forward and widen the space between the back of your tongue and your throat., Singers often raise their chin for more power, but this actually causes damage over time. When you are about to increase your power, keep your chin level. This technique eliminates the strain on your vocal cords, while also adding power to your voice.As you work on higher notes and enter the whistle register, notice a natural tendency to lift your chin and actively work against that tendency. It takes practice to retrain yourself, but it increases your power.

, It’s tempting to force a lot of air through your throat at once, but this can damage your vocal cords. Work on developing a continuous airflow from the start of the note to the finish. Mastery of breath management is an important prerequisite for singing in the whistle register.Practice breathing deeply and slowly releasing the air. Let the air out as slowly as possible to increase your endurance.
Use this practice technique with a whistle note making it last as long as you can.

First of all, understand that your body contains the machinery required to project your singing voice.,
Learn PRANAYAAM.,
Get a trainer.,
Practice breath control.,
Listen to Hindustani classical singers.,
Try following one of these greats.,
Go to concerts to see for yourself how great vocalists project their voice.,
Most importantly, love your voice.,
Finally, it is of utmost importance to keep training yourself, whether formally or informally, on a regular basis.",How to Project Your Hindustani Singing Voice," If you do have a singing voice, that is. How does one tell if one has a singing voice? Well, think of get-togethers, parties, or hang-out sessions where you either were asked to sing or volunteered to. Recall the response you got. Were people happy to hear you? If they were, then that's the best proof that you've got a singing voice. Don't count bathroom singing, though.


The machinery that you have in your body is made up of your stomach, lungs, windpipe, larynx (throat, simply put), mouth and tongue. It is of utmost importance that you take good care of these. Gargling with hot, salted water is a good way to keep the larynx clear and free of germs. The more organic and digestible your food, the better will you be able to control your voice.;
, Or practice holding your breath. Begin practising holding it for a few seconds and increase gradually. However, don't hold it for much more than a minute. It is advisable to learn the proper technique of pranayam. A yoga teacher will be able to instruct you.

, A classical Hindustani vocal music trainer will be able to suggest exercises that you can use to project your voice.

, Breath control is of utmost importance. Control does not imply simply or only holding the breath for the longest possible duration (which is around 2-5 minutes, in the case of experts). It involves the ability to use air stored in your lungs to sing fluently, that is, without unnecessary or inharmonious pauses.

, Try to emulate them to the extent possible. You can also sing classical numbers from old Hindi films. For that matter, you can try out any classic songs by greats such as Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Yesudas, Hariharan, and so on.

, Practice singing their songs. Invest in a good CD or cassette player and CDs and cassettes. Choose a favourite singer/s, and listen to his/her singing attentively. Try singing along with the song playing on your player. You can also try out karaoke audio CDs and cassettes. You will need to 'know' a song thoroughly, however, before you are able to use karaoke tracks. Such tracks are also available online. Explore the Internet for karaoke tracks.

, This will constitute first-hand experience.

, Protect it, develop it, and don't take paan (betel leaf) or tobacco. Keep well away from these. Develop your capacity to sing gradually.

, Riyaaz (practice), is crucial. Spare an hour or so daily or regularly to practice singing and projecting your voice.

Drink plenty of water.,
Watch your diet.,
Avoid caffeine.,
Have a warm drink just before singing.",How to Prepare to Sing1," In the days and hours leading up to a performance, make sure to drink plenty of water. Water keeps your vocal cords from drying out, which is important before you sing. Stick to plain water for hydration over things like juice and soda., The foods you eat actually have an effect on your voice. Avoid dairy, pasta, and chocolate, as these substances can leave your voice dry. Instead, go for things like fruits like apples to lubricate your vocal cords as well as soup.Always eat before singing. Singing on an empty stomach can affect your performance.

, Caffeine is a diuretic. It can leave your voice dry and scratchy. Avoid caffeinated beverages, like coffee, before a big performance or audition., Go for something like non-caffeinated herbal teas or water with lemon and honey. This can soothe and hydrate your throat, helping you sing more efficiently.Remember to avoid sugary or caffeinated beverages before singing.

Take lessons from a coach.,
Emphasize clear vowel sounds.,
Stop if you feel any discomfort, pain, or tickling in your throat.",How to Project Well While Singing in Your Whistle Register2," Whistle register is not a singing style that you can easily learn on your own. In many cases it isn’t safe to try it without proper instruction. If you have a singing coach already, tell them you want to work on your whistle register. Ask them how to improve your technique.If you don’t have a vocal coach already, search one out who has worked with singers on their whistle register. If they have experience with it, they will be able to give you better advice.

, Crisp vowels are important in whistle register like they are in all other ranges. The vowel sounds that you need to master are Ah, as in father, Eh, as in met, Ee as in feet, Oh, as in dome, and Oo, as in shoe. Practice forming these vowel sounds in your whistle register.To practice this, look at the lyrics to one of your favorite songs. Make a list of the phrases that contain words with these vowel sounds. Sing those lines entering your whistle register on the words with strong vowel sounds.

, Always practice your whistle register safely. Because your vocal cords are tighter in whistle register than they are at other times, you may strain them as you work on the technique. If at any point your throat starts to feel uncomfortable, stop immediately.Take a break for a while and let your vocal cords rest. Never push past the point when you begin to hurt because you will end up damaging your vocal cords.

Hydrate before, during, and after performances.,
Talk quietly before a performance.,
Warm up before every performance.",How to Project Well While Singing in Your Whistle Register3," Keep your throat moist when singing in whistle register because the strain is greater than when singing in other ranges. Drink lots of water around your performance. Stay away from alcohol and caffeine before performances because both substances dry out your throat., Talking loudly puts more strain on our vocal cords than talking at a normal volume. If you talk loudly, or talk for a long time, you put extra strain on your vocal cords besides the strain of singing. Don’t talk for long periods of time the day of your show and definitely don’t yell., Any time you are going to sing, you should warm up your mouth, jaw, and vocal cords. Perform a few exercises like singing through your scales and trilling your tongue and lips. Work upward through your notes to reach the whistle register. Never jump straight into notes in the whistle register."

Songs can be about virtually anything, but if you want your lyrics to be meaningful, you should choose a subject that resonates with you personally.


Brainstorm topics that are important to you. Think about what's going in your life, then expand outward to include your culture, your city, or even your country.
Think about any specific moments in which you really struggled with that topic/issue. For example, if you're writing about heartbreak, think about how you may have felt about yourself or another person when you've been abandoned. If you're writing about a cultural issue, think about a single moment that encapsulates your experience with that issue.
Consider both how you felt in the moment, and what you've learned after living through that experience.;
, Freewriting is an easy way to get started when you're experiencing writer's block. Once you've chosen a general subject for your song, set a timer for five minutes. While keeping your subject in mind, write continuously for the entire five minutes without stopping until the timer goes off.Try not to think too hard about what to write. Simply jot down the first word/idea/image/sound that pops in your head when you think about your subject.
Don't worry about spelling, revision, or even if the words make sense. The goal is to keep writing in order to generate as many ideas as possible.
Keep writing until the timer goes off. Even if you have to write nonsensical words until the next word pops into your head, just keep your pen moving across the page.

, Once the timer goes off and you have a list of random words all over the page, you'll need to review what you've written and choose the best words. Think about which words are the most evocative, the most image-heavy, the most emotional, and of course the most relevant.


Compile the best 10 to 12 words from your list.If you've got over 12 really good words, that's okay. You don't have to use them all, and it may be more helpful to have a few extras that can get cut. If you don't have at least 10 words, try repeating the freewriting exercise.

, Now that you have a list of words, work on finding thematic connections between some of your words. Think about the associations you have with each word, and where those associations come from in your life.As you come up with associations, you're lending emotions to the words. Even though it's currently just a list of random words, each word becomes meaningful as you build implicit and explicit associations to go with the list.
Write a few words, a phrase, or even a sentence about each word and the associations you have with them. These won't necessarily be your lyrics, but having these written ""explanations"" may serve as building blocks to your actual song lyrics.

, If you're comfortable at this stage of the writing process, try building your words and your explanations/associations into a series of short phrases. They don't have to be perfect, or rhyme, or even make sense at this point when pieced together. But you may be able to take one of these phrases and turn it into part of a verse, or even a central line in the refrain.


At this stage, you shouldn't be thinking about the complete song yet. Just let these incomplete/partial ideas come from your list, and keep the subject of your song in mind as you expand on and play with these short phrases., The hook is another term for the chorus. Before you start writing this part of your song, look back over the list of phrases you've composed. Think about which phrases contain the most powerful, vivid, or significant words that relate directly to your chosen theme/subject.


The chorus usually starts with a line or two that get expanded. The chorus doesn't have to rhyme, but it should be catchy and engaging to a listener.Try expanding on the phrases that you feel are the most representative or evocative of your song's subject. Again, don't worry about perfection at this stage. Just try to expand and elaborate on what you've already written.

, Any piece of writing can be written from multiple points of view, and as the writer it is your job to decide what point of view works best for the song. You may need to try out a few different points of view to determine what would be best for telling your particular story.


First person singular (using ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""my"") is one of the most popular points of view because it conveys personal experience while also being highly relatable. Someone listening to the song (and especially someone singing along!) will easily substitute herself for the ""I"" of a relatable song.Just because first person point of view is easily relatable, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the right fit for your song. Perhaps your song is about bearing witness to something, rather than being a participant.
Play around with different points of view to see what feels right for what you're trying to say.

, Some of the strongest song choruses condense and express the raw, basic emotion at the heart of a song. There's no need to make the chorus extremely complex (unless that's your style and you're comfortable doing so). The key is to make the chorus emotionally resonant and thematic of the song's overall subject.


As you write the actual lines of your chorus, try to keep this part of the song centered on one single emotional point of focus. If your chorus tries to cover too much ground, it will be confusing, sloppy, or difficult for listeners to grab onto.If you're having trouble deciding what the central emotion of the song is, go back to your chosen subject and your list of words/phrases and look for common themes. As long as your subject is relatively specific, you shouldn't have too hard a time coming up with corresponding emotions.

, Structurally, the chorus typically has between four and six lines. It can rhyme, but it doesn't have to. It can also contain a refrain, which is a lyric or phrase that is repeated at either the beginning or end of each chorus line.There are no hard and fast rules for how your chorus has to be structured, but at least knowing the basic format can help you craft a more structurally-coherent chorus.


A common format for chorus lines is AABA, which means the first, second, and fourth lines of a four-line chorus either rhyme or have a repeated phrase. The third line should be thematically related to lines one, two, and four, but might contain some twist to make it just slightly different.

, Once you have a few lines of the chorus, see if it all makes sense as a whole. Thematically, the chorus should basically condense your emotional reaction to the events, people, or places mentioned in the verses. Even though you haven't written the verses yet, your chorus at this point should still describe a clear reaction to whatever the song is about.In a song about heartbreak, for example, the chorus should talk about the emotional reaction to losing someone. The verses may narrate how that heartbreak came about, but the chorus should be very emotional, image-based, and/or contain your reaction to the fallout of the relationship.
A protest song whose verses detail/narrate some social event (say, for example, the execution of an innocent person who's been wrongfully accused) should have a chorus that deals with what it all means - it may contain outrage, horror, grief, or something else entirely, but it functions as a sort of condensed reaction to the subject.

, Now that you have a subject and your reaction to it, you'll need to more-or-less narrate the events that led to your reaction. One of the most important components of a song verse is the action that drives the song's story. Action also helps you show the reader what you're thinking or feeling without having to explicitly speak your thoughts/feelings.The old writing adage ""show, don't tell"" applies to songwriting as well.
It's more powerful to hear a lyric like, ""I write your name inside of every single heart I see"" than to simply say ""I love you."" Saying ""I love you"" in a love song risks being boring to the audience, whereas some descriptive action that indicates love is much more meaningful.
If you're having a hard time with the action of the verses, look back at your original list, read over your chorus, and think about the central subject of your song. You should be able to come up with some concrete, descriptive action phrases.
If you're having trouble writing the narrative verses of your song, try writing a very short story about your song's subject. It might help you determine what the proper course of events would be, or it might simply get more ideas down on paper. Either way, it will only make your song stronger in the end., Once you know the subject's action, you can use descriptive words to create corresponding imagery for the listener. Your imagery should build off of the action you've described, and the two should work together. For example, in a song about losing someone you love, you might include a line that describes falling on your knees and shedding tears. This is a strong visual cue that lets the audience know the extent of your relationship while also supporting your emotional reaction in the chorus.Your audience won't be able to ""see"" the way you're feeling in the song, but image-heavy lyrics can help the audience have a visual of what you were doing when you felt that way. This makes it easier for the audience to grasp the meaning of the song. It also personalizes the story you're telling.

, Details are what bring imagery to life. You can use strong, captivating adjectives and adverbs to build off of your imagery while also adding to it. For example, in a line that describes you falling on your knees while crying after losing someone, you might describe the way the ground felt under your knees, or how the wind felt blowing on your back. These kinds of specific details take an otherwise generic event and make it personal. Even if a reader has lost someone, she probably hasn't fell to her knees in the mud on a cold November morning, for example.Don't use generic descriptions like ""lonely"" or ""beautiful."" Try to be as unique as possible, as this will make your song stand out from others on the same subject. It will also lend a lot of emotion and meaning to the verses, and might make them even more relatable.
Make your song specific. Describe the weather, or the time of year, or what someone in the song was wearing. This will help further bring the song to life by making it all about that event., Your verses might describe the central event chronologically (in the order that that event unfolded), or your verses might be more a general meditation on the event that led to your emotional reaction. Either way, you might need to play around with the structure of the verses to find an arrangement that works the best for your song. If your song is about an actual, dated event (like the death of someone important to you), then chronological arrangement is the most logical. If it's about a general life event (like a breakup), you can play around with the order of events a little more so that each verse builds toward the chorus.


The first line of every verse is important, but the first line of the first verse is arguably the most important line in the song. It's what will end up making the listener continue to listen or turn off your song.Use the opening line of each verse to catch the listener's attention while also establishing the mood of what's to come in the song. You may want to make it declarative, as this can make your message more clear from the start.
Try to load the early parts of your song with one or two really catchy phrases or concrete images. This can help hold a listener's attention and curiosity.
Repetition is fine in a song (so long as there is some variance throughout the song), but steer clear of cliche. If the audience can predict what the next line will be without having ever heard the song before, your listeners won't find the song particularly interesting.Remember, stick to one major theme/point/topic for the entire song! It's okay to talk about a few different events or memories in the verses, but they should all relate to the single event that the chorus so emotionally describes.

, The pre-chorus leads the listener from the verse to the chorus. It often takes the narrative descriptions of the verse and segues into the emotional response of the chorus. The pre-chorus can either hint at the emotions of the chorus, or simply bridge the two parts of the song.You don't necessarily need a pre-chorus. Not every song includes one. But when used properly, a pre-chorus can help set the stage for the chorus in a really effective way.
Jumping from the narrative verse to the emotional response might make sense without a transition, or it could feel awkward and incomplete. Only you can decide whether or not to include a pre-chorus, and it will probably boil down to what you feel your song needs to tell your personal story.

, Now that your verses are descriptive narrations of an event and your chorus is a vivid emotional response, you'll need to start thinking of the song as an operational whole. The chorus should still be the emotional center of the song, but your verses should set up that emotional response. If your audience doesn't see the chorus as an understandable reaction to the verses, it might be confusing or even off-putting.


Even if the verses move through multiple events or various aspects of a single event, they should all work together to either address or build toward the emotional reactions that make up the chorus.Keep the emotions to a minimum in the verses. Too much emotion all over the place might make the song difficult for a listener to process.
Make the verses concrete. They should actively describe people, places, circumstances, or situations, without any outpouring of emotion.If you're having trouble coming up with a line in your verse, try humming the melody that goes with the rest of the song. Even without music, you should have some rough idea from the lyrics what the song might sound like. Humming or even singing ""la la la"" to the rhythm of your verse might help you improvise words or get a better feel for what could potentially work in that line., It can be difficult to tell whether or not your lyrics are meaningful to others. They are almost certainly meaningful to you, but if you've written them honestly and vividly, your lyrics will most likely resonate with your listeners.


Show your lyrics to a trusted friend, or sing the song for someone whose opinion you value.
Ask for honest feedback. If there is anything in your song that your friend feels is out of place, confusing, or disingenuous, ask her to let you know.
Make revisions as needed. Use the feedback you get from your friends to decide what parts of the song (if any) need to be reworked. Then follow the process through again to strengthen the part(s) of the song that need work.

, Depending on your song's subject matter, you might want lyrics that show your strength and determination (or the strength/determination of the narrator). The easiest ways to do this (beyond simply what the lyrics actually say on paper) is to alter your singing voice to convey that strength and determination of character.Start the melodies of your song on the first beat of each bar for a really strong, consistent beat throughout the song.
Consider beginning the song in either a lower or higher range than you usually sing. Then when you raise (or lower, depending on how you started) your range during the chorus, it adds a noticeable emphasis to the lyrics and draws your listener's attention to the melody.

, If you're singing about love, loss, or heartache, your lyrics probably already convey a lot of that emotion. But the way you sing those lyrics can help strengthen the emotion of those verses and chorus even more.Try to sing the majority of your song's melody in your vocal mid-range. That way you can add leaps in your vocal range, either upward or downward, to give more emotion to what you're saying.
You can hear a good example of this in Janis Joplin's version of ""Me and Bobby McGee"". She sings much of the song in her central vocal range, but whenever she raises or lowers her pitch, it immediately adds a sense of longing and sorrow to the song.

, As you shape the melody of your song, try speaking the lyrics to yourself in a somewhat melodramatic fashion. That will help you find where in your vocal range a given line should rise or fall, and it can also help you determine which words to accent, drag out, or cut short.Play around with different accentuations and rises/falls. You may not get it right the first time - and that's okay. Your lyrics are already very meaningful and evocative, and the performance should come naturally once you're comfortable and confident with what you're saying.

Brainstorm specific themes, subjects, or experiences to write about.,
Write a letter to a friend about something you’re passionate about.,
Tell a story about a memory from childhood.,
Start with the music.,
Craft a catchy hook.",How to Write Songs As a Teenager1," A good way to start a song is to pick something for the song to center on. If you can focus on an emotion about a certain thing, or some aspect of society that affects you, it can make writing lyrics easier. Avoid general topics in favor of something very specific.


Rather than saying, “I’m going to write about love,” you might say, “I’m going to write about the first crush that I remember and what that felt like.”
Instead of aiming to write a song that is sad in general, think of when you lost a loved one, or even when someone you know lost someone, and write about the specific experience of that.;
, This is a good way to get lots of ideas down quickly. Think of what you care deeply about, maybe a social issue or a recent news event, and tell your friend all about it. Write as much as you can. Then go through and pick out phrases and lines that stand out.You can work these phrases into a song, adding new lyrics as needed.
For example, let’s say your best friend just moved to another state and you won’t see them for a year. Write a letter telling them how important they have been to you and what you will miss most about them. You can then highlight the best sections and form those into a song.
Or choose a social issue, like the water crisis throughout much of the world, and write to a friend telling them why you care about that issue. The emotions you express in the letter can make great lyrics for a song about how you want to see things change.

, Songs that tell a specific story can be a good option when you are starting out, because they don’t rely on abstract ideas. Think of a specific happy or sad memory from when you were young and write an account of it. Narrow down the story and arrange it into song form.


For example, write about a unique camping trip you took with your father when you were young, before your siblings were born. Tell of the fun you had and how things changed some once there were more kids in the family.
You could write about a time when you got lost in the mall and had to wait for your mom to come get you. You can relate it to how you still feel lost sometimes.
You could also tell the story from an outside perspective, as if it happened to someone else rather than you, which may help you explore the story more objectively.

, Many songwriters who are good at an instrument will start by coming up with a melody, even if it is just a few seconds long, and writing lyrics that fit the tone of the music. Having a tune in mind may give you the inspiration you need to write the lyrics. Ask yourself what the music makes you think of and feel. Work the lyrics around that.


If you have a tape recorder, an app on your phone, or music software on the computer, you can record the music. If not, you can just play it multiple times through and write the lyrics you think of as you go.
You could also listen to an instrumental piece by a professional musician and let it inspire lyrics for your song. Then you can go back and write new music to fit those lyrics, maybe something similar to what you listened to.
If you don’t play an instrument and writing actual music is not an option, try whistling, humming, or making instrument sounds with your mouth. This can give you a rhythm or tune without using an instrument.

, The hook is typically the part of the song that draws you in, and is often repeated multiple times as the chorus. If you get a solid chorus that emphasizes the main point of the song, you can use it as a central theme for the song, building the verses around the chorus. A good hook usually can’t carry a bad song, but it can be enough to draw listeners in if the rest of the song supports the hook.If you are working on some lyrics, try to pick out the phrase or set of lines that says most clearly what you want to say. This is probably what you want to use for the chorus. If one line of the song was the only thing people heard, which line would you want it to be? There’s your hook.
Think of classic songs and what makes the hooks so memorable. There’s The Beatles, “I wanna hold your hand,” which is simple and to the point. More recently, think of how Carly Rae Jepsen’s, “here’s my number, call me maybe,” got consistently stuck in your head. A hook is the part of the song you want to get stuck in your listeners’ heads.

Activate your breath.,
Relax your jaw.,
Do lip and tongue trills.,
Sing some scales.,
Hum.,
Cool down.",How to Prepare to Sing2," Breathing should always be the first thing you do to warm up. To start warming up, practice breath relaxation by taking a few normal breaths. As you breathe, be conscious of your body and adjust it as necessary to get into the right position to sing.Take note of your shoulders and chest. Make sure they're relaxed and low.
Make sure you channel your breaths to your lower abdomen rather than your chest. It can help to put a hand on your lower abdomen and make sure your hand rises and falls as you breathe.
Hold an ""S"" sound as you exhale to get your vocal cords going.
Repeat as many breaths as you need to feel like you're breathing slow, deep, and steady.

, Place the heels of your hand just below the cheekbone. Massage your jaw using the heels of your hand. Your mouth should gently open as you massage your jaw. Repeat this motion a few times., Lip and tongue trills prepare your lips and tongues for singing. Do some scales while doing lip and tongue trills to warm up.For a lip trill, push your lips together and make a raspberry sound by releasing the air. Try an ""h"" sound, then a ""b"" sound, and then try to use the ""b"" sound to do a scale. Do as much of the scale as you comfortably can doing lip trills.
For a tongue trill, put your tongue just behind your upper teeth. Exhale using an ""r"" sound. Try to vary the pitch while you trill. Vary the pitch as much as is comfortable for you.

, Start at a lower pitch and work your way up a basic scale. If you've never done scales before, you listen to scales online and use them as a guide. A vocal instructor can also help you master scales.Use a ""me"" sound to work your way up the scale. Go as high as you comfortably can.
Use an ""e"" sound and then work your way back down the scale.

, Humming gets your lips, teeth, and facial bones prepped to sing. Press your lips together and release your jaw and then hum. Use a nasal sound, humming using the same types of breaths you use to sigh. Then, glide from a high to low pitch., After you finish a warm up, do a few more minutes of gentle humming. Do not attempt to vary your pitch too much and focus on the lips as you hum. Use the ""m"" sound as you hum and try to get your nose and lips vibrating slightly."
"
Choose the right music.,
Learn the meaning of the lyrics.,
Give yourself plenty of time to learn the material.,
Print out your sheet music.",How to Prepare to Sing3," If you're doing a show or audition, choose music that resonates with you personally and highlights your vocal range. Go for songs within your vocal range, preferably ones you have previously performed publicly with success. Avoid picking a song that's unfamiliar or overly challenging for you. This can throw you off at a performance or audition., You need to bring some emotional resonance to the performance. Before singing in public, give the meaning of a song's lyrics serious consideration. Find a personal connection to the song that allows you to best convey its underlying feeling.Read the lyrics online and think about each word. Ask yourself what the writer is trying to say and what underlying emotions are at play.
Try to identify with the song on a personal level. For example, if a song is sad or melancholy, think of a time you've experienced these emotions personally.

, Preparation is the best way to give a successful performance. Make sure to practice a little bit each day in the weeks leading up to an audition or show. Giving yourself ample time to learn the music will help ensure a quality performance., Always come to an audition or performance prepared. Make sure you have a printed copy of your sheet music on hand. In case you get nervous and forget something, you can consult the sheet music to get yourself back on track."

Keep a running list of lyrics in a note app or on paper.,
Maintain your own perspective.,
Capture images with your words.,
Rewrite the song after the first draft.,
Let everything inspire you.",How to Write Songs As a Teenager2," Since song ideas come at all times, like when you are riding the bus to school, getting off the soccer field after practice, or raking leaves in your yard, make a habit of writing everything down. Carry a notebook or use a memo app on your phone. Every few days, read through what you have written and see if you can expand on something.


You might come up with the lyric “you’re like a shirt that doesn’t fit,” but at the moment, it seems not to mean anything. If you look at it a week later, maybe you’ll have an idea for how to write a whole song around that idea. Or that line may fit into another song you are working on.
If you don’t keep a specific memo that has all your ideas, you may misplace them, so it works best if you always jot them down in the same place.
As an exercise, once in a while, sit down and make yourself write a song using one of these small phrases. You may actually come up with more than you would have thought.

, Teenagers often want to think about being older, but it can be helpful to stay firmly planted in your experience as a teen. You know how you are feeling and what goes on in your life right now, so use that. People that are older often lose the memory of what being young is like, so take advantage of it.On the other hand, sometimes it is a good exercise to really try to get outside of yourself and write from the perspective of someone else. You could try writing a song of what you wish someone older would tell you.

, Think of your favorite song, and pick out what parts of the song make you see specific pictures in your mind. This is a great technique when trying to figure out what to write. You want your song to show people images of what you are talking about, so try to use concrete descriptions.


For example, you want to describe a girl sitting alone in her room. Tell what her room looks like: pink walls painted before she was born, stuffed animals abandoned in the corner long ago, postcards of places she has never been covering the walls. These details make the image more vivid.
Try to describe a beautiful place you have visited, including every color and feature you can think of. Images like this put people in the place you are describing.

, Often the first round of a song is not what becomes the final copy. You have to get your ideas out first, and then you can go through and see how to rework it. You may switch verses around, find a better way to word something, or add a section you didn’t think of the first time.Editing and reworking a song doesn’t mean it’s no good. It means you think you can make it better. Make sure you keep the original copy, as you are changing things, because you may end up liking that version better than what you come up with later.
It can also be helpful to put the song aside for a few days or a week and come back to it fresh to see what you might want to change.
If you can get your point across with less words, this is usually a good idea. Thoughts and lines that try to say too much can be hard to work into a rhythm.

, Topics for songs are around you constantly, if you allow yourself to really see and consider the world. Snow falling, dropping your books in the hall, the swing of a golf club, a homeless man on the street are all worth writing a song about if you have something to say about them. Don’t discount any experience as unfit for inclusion in a song.


Great songs are often about simple, even boring, occurrences, but they are written in such a way that makes them interesting and beloved. For example, you could write about a carwash: “I’m trapped inside, water rushing over me, but I’m here, and now I’m coming clean.” It’s an everyday thing, but you can give it deeper meaning.
Think of a book, TV show, or movie you love and try to write a song about one of the characters, or from the perspective of one of the characters.

Have fun!",How to Sing Karaoke with Confidence," In Japan, they call it your ""juhachiban"", ""#18"" in South Korea and ""banquet song"" in Hong Kong, but you can just call it ""the song you're going to be totally awesome at"". You might be tempted to pick an obscure song that you're really passionate about, but when you're starting out, try to pick a song that many people are familiar with and enjoy. The audience will have more fun listening and cheering you on, which will make things easier for you!Choose well-known songs that are in your range. Can you reach the high notes without screaming? Can you reach the low notes? Make sure the melody is easy to hum and that you can feel the rhythm easily. Learn the melody and study it as thoroughly as you would study any other subject. Record yourself and listen back. Taking time to write out all the words will help you memorize them quickly.
Upbeat songs tend to be better crowd pleasers than slow songs. It should still be something that you enjoy singing along to, though, and make sure it's within your vocal range. ""Twist and Shout"" by the Beatles is a safe choice; for female vocals, go for ABBA, Gloria Gaynor, or Madonna; guys should look into Sinatra, and Tom Jones.As you gain your confidence, you can choose more challenging or lesser known music.;
, If you can get your hands on a karaoke machine, use it! Otherwise, you can usually dig up the karaoke version of a popular song on the Internet, and lyrics are easy to find. Play the song often, and sing it all the time. Sing while you're cleaning, during commercials, as you're washing the dishes...Practice makes perfect. You want to get to the point where you know the song by heart.


Try to get the instrumental tracks on cassette or CD so you can sing along without hearing the other singer. If you always practice singing with someone else's voice, you will never learn to lead with your voice. Background tracks to the most popular songs are gener­ally available at record stores and media outlets. Go to the Internet if you can't find them in your town.
When possible, practice while holding a microphone (or a hairbrush) since that's what you'll be doing when you perform.
To improve your karaoke, listen to the song with headphones and record yourself singing along. When you play it back, how do you sound?
If you have a full length mirror or, better yet, a camcorder, use it!

, Singing is a very physical activity and requires a power source. Support your voice tone the way you would support your body when you're lifting something heavy. Get your legs under you, tuck your hips under, and use strength from the lower part of your body—as if you were lifting. Push the balls of your feet firmly into the floor. Try not to lift your chin; instead, keep your head rounded over the microphone with your chin lower in the front. This makes the tone sound warm and resonant.

, Actually think about what the words mean. It's surprising how much better we sound when we really mean what we're saying. Choose songs that are age-appropriate so you're not trying to be convincing in a song about your six kids and three divorces.

, Try writing down all the things they think could go wrong-going off pitch, forgetting the words, falling down-whatever they fear most. Then sing and make all those mistakes—just do a terrible job. This is not as easy as it sounds. You'll find it's almost as hard to be terrible as it is to be perfect, but once you've done it a few times, you'll find this exercise helps put your performance fears to rest.

, Visit a few different karaoke bars and clubs and look for the following:


Is there a supportive crowd? Some karaoke venues have regulars who are friendly and who cheer each other on. That's what you're looking for--not a place with high ""turnover"" and bad sports who complain about bad singers.
Does the singer have to face the audience? Check how the screens are arranged. You might want to have the option of facing away from the audience so that if you get too nervous, you can look at a screen that doesn't force you to look at the audience.

, In East Asia, karaoke is often enjoyed in a more private setting, rather than in bars or clubs. You can rent a karaoke-equipped room by the hour or half-hour and share the costs with a few friends. This is an excellent way to ease into karaoke because you can hand-pick your audience. Karaoke boxes aren't as common in other parts of the world as they are in East Asia, but it's definitely worth looking into. They're very popular in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area, and they might be found wherever there's a strong Asian community.You can also investigate how much it costs to privately rent an actual karaoke-equipped venue; if you get enough people together to chip in, it could work.

, Before you take the plunge and sing by yourself, find a decent singer to do karaoke with. It should be someone who's already comfortable singing in public, and who can garner a little bit of cheering and clapping. You might be nervous the whole time, but in the end, when it's over and done with, you'll feel good about having performed, and the next time won't be as intimidating.

, Getting up to sing is a chance to act out your ""star"" fantasies. Go all the way. Find the ""ham"" in you. Wear some glam clothing, do some rock and roll moves, sing your heart out. In truth, most people would rather see you succeed than fail, and giving a full-out performance will always go over better than hanging back. Trust me. Things don't improve when you sound as if you're apologizing for giving such a rotten, worthless performance.

, Once you've picked a venue, go regularly, and be a good sport. Cheer everyone on. Clap after every song. Avoid wincing when someone's voice cracks. It's good karaoke karma, because eventually when you get up to sing, they'll recognize you and they'll cheer you on. Also, you'll recognize them, and they won't feel like strangers anymore.

, This, of course, is the most important part. Smile, move to the music, and enjoy your time in the spotlight. You're not there to impress people--you're there to have a good time, and the audience wants to have a good time with you, so be bold and sing your heart out.

Specialized karaoke bars exist and let you rent private rooms or sing to patrons for a small charge per song. Otherwise, many other businesses offer karaoke nights. Check with restaurants, bars, community centers, and other locations for advertisements stating when they allow performances.


You may want to go ahead and sit in on a karaoke night first, especially if you’re nervous. This will allow you to become familiar with the atmosphere and the particular crowd at the venue.;
, The karaoke DJ will most likely have a catalogue of songs for you to choose from. They may also have more recent songs they have yet to list in their binder. A good karaoke song is one that you know all the words to and be able to sing effectively. You should never be stuck humming parts, waiting for long instrumental breaks, repeating phrases often, or singing in a monotone.


Listen to songs on sites such as Ameritz and Sunfly before you go. Many of the songs will sound different on stage because they have different arrangements for karaoke.Consider if you can sing the song as well. You don’t need to have professional vocals, but you should be energetic. Choose a song with vocals that match yours, such as one that has more talk-singing instead of wailing if your singing voice will sound soft.

, Take a look at the people who will be listening to your performance. In karaoke, you’re performing for them, so to keep the night fun, choose a song that keeps the energy level high in the room. Don’t choose a long, slow ballad at the end of the night, for example, or show tunes in a standard bar where most people won’t appreciate these songs.Remember that you can change your song up until your performance, so monitor the mood around you., Many places have you write your name and song choice on a slip of paper. Figure out how to sign up for karaoke so that the DJ can call you up to the stage and queue your song. Watch how other people sign up or ask someone during songs.

, Other people will want a chance to sing, so sit back and appreciate their performances instead of being rude. Listen to the performances and clap when one ends. Don’t crowd around the DJ asking for your turn and don’t interrupt someone else’s performance., Be kind to the DJ and their equipment. Often running karaoke is work for them and they deal with many people who may be drunk, rude, or requesting the same song. When you request a song, give them a little bit of money. For special requests, such as bringing all your friends on stage to sing one song, give them an extra tip.If you need to politely ask the DJ a question, do it during a performance. When there’s no singing, the DJ is usually busy setting up for the next song.

, So it’s your turn at last. Now you have to go on stage with all the eyes in the room upon you. Breathe in. Breathe deeply and try to take in more air as you perform. This will help you relax and sing louder. Get into your performance. Don’t be afraid to move around and project your voice. Have fun and you’ll find that your performance benefits too.Karaoke isn’t about having the best voice in the room. Stay present and stay excited at being the focus of the attention for a few minutes.

, When your turn is done, go back to your seat. Don’t try to perform another song. Also, move away from the stage. Crowding other performers, dancing in front of the stage, or jeering is bad etiquette.

, There are many ways you can bring karaoke into your home. Classic karaoke machines use CDs and DVDs, but a more common option now is computer software. Karaoke can be done using your computer and finding, streaming, or downloading songs as well as CDs and DVDs.Song software services such as KaraFun and Karaoke Version allow you to play karaoke songs from your computer for a monthly fee.
Applications such as Yokee Karaoke and Red Karaoke work with phones and wireless speakers.
Karaoke tracks can also be downloaded from sites such as Karasongs.com or Youtube.
Some TV providers offer subscriptions to on-demand karaoke services such as The Karaoke Channel.

, Unless you’re going to depend on the loudness of your own voice, you need amplification. Microphones have a wide range of prices and if you’re starting out or don’t plan to do karaoke often, you will be fine using an average microphone.that you can find in electronics stores or in karaoke shops online.


If you’re planning on singing with friends, get a second microphone for singalongs and duets.
Some microphones now operate wirelessly. These are a little more expensive than the wired variety.

, If there’s a particular song you want to sing, you can make a karaoke track from it without much effort. This requires an audio editing computer program such as Audacity. Load the song in the editor. Separate the vocal track from the instrumental track. Invert one of the tracks, then change them both to mono.If you don’t want to manipulate sound files yourself, download a program such as Karaoke Anything! to convert CD files and MP3s through a simple menu.

, The more you perform karaoke in your home, outdoors, or at parties, the better sound quality you’ll require. A laptop computer comes with small speakers that are good for you alone in your bedroom, but even cheap plug-in speakers project sound much better. Choose speakers designed for musical performance. These often have amplifiers built in, may be wireless or Bluetooth-capable, and can be found in electronic stores or online.Standard speakers, such as the ones you use with your TV, are designed to replay recorded audio, so they can’t handle the range of singing vocals.
As you customize your setup, you can add amplifiers, subwoofers, and additional speakers to create more sound range.

While you need not be the ""best"" singer at the competition, and you certainly don’t need to be professionally trained, those things won’t hurt you. Karaoke contests are usually judged on some combination of vocal ability, audience response, and stage presence, but if you can nail the singing part, the judges may give you some leeway on other aspects of your performance. The best way to practice karaoke is to sing karaoke.;
, Most karaoke contests allow you to pick your own songs, and if you’re going to win, you should have practiced these time and time again. Yes, the words are right there on the screen, but if you know the words and have perfect timing, you don’t even have to look at the screen. There have also been instances where the MC deliberately mutes the song, or the music is genuinely mis-recorded, and you won't hear the song for some time. You have to keep on singing until the music returns. Not only will your overall performance be more masterful, you may impress the judges and audience with your knowledge of the songs. An elimination round in a contest is a bad time to find out that you can't pull off a particular song.

, Karaoke contests are usually either judged by a panel of judges or by the audience. In some of the latter, the audience will actually formally vote, while in most a judge or judges will try to gauge the audience's reaction to a song. You also want to know how you're being judged. Most contests are based on overall performance, but some look strictly at how well you impersonate the artist (or how original you are), or other factors. Finally, know how many songs you'll be expected to sing so you'll have enough prepared in advance.

, Some contests require that you sing a particular kind of music (80s rock only, for example), or that you appear in costume. Make sure to follow the rules or you probably won't win even if you give the best performance.

, Yes, other performers are your competition, but don't try to malign them or mock them, even if someone really can't sing. Be polite, and unless the rules dictate otherwise, applaud everybody. Remember you will very likely be judged on your audience's reaction to your songs, and many of your competitors are part of the audience. They won't treat a heckler kindly.

, Above all, sing to the audience, not to the karaoke screen. Beyond that, know your audience. Understanding your audience will help you choose songs that most appeal to them. If you haven't been to a venue before, you might want to visit it in advance to check out the crowd and see what they're playing on the jukebox. On the night of the competition, try to gauge the judges' or audience's reaction to songs and see if you can spot trends (maybe they hate love songs), and choose your songs accordingly if you still can.

, There are a lot of songs that just about anybody can sing passably, but if you've got an exceptional vocal range or if you can rap just like Snoop (rap is notoriously difficult to karaoke) choose songs that reflect that. If you want to awe the audience--and you do--you need a great performance of a difficult song.

, People come to karaoke (or to concerts) to see a performance, not just to hear one. Don't just stand there and sing, and don't act like you don't know what to do during an instrumental interlude. Convey the emotions of the song with your facial gestures and body movements, and by all means dance if appropriate. Get some ideas by watching concert videos of professional performers. If you can find a video of the original artist performing the song you're going to sing, all the better.

, Your attire can help the judges remember you, especially if you go to a themed competition or if you're only singing certain kinds of songs. If you're going to sing glam rock, dress like a glam rocker, or maybe dress like a country singer to add a bit of humor to your performance.

, Even if it's subconscious, most people judge a karaoke performance by how close it sounds to the original. It's amazing when someone gets up to sing a Garth Brooks song and you could swear they were just lip-syncing to a CD of Garth himself. While you need not be a professional voice impersonator, try to fit the mood and style of the song (i.e. add a bit of twang to a country song).

, Musicians who cover a song can alter it all they want. You don't have that luxury because the karaoke music is designed to sound just like the original version. That said, there's a little room for creativity. For example, try inserting the name of a local landmark in place of one mentioned in the song. This can have a humorous effect and is likely to get a rise out of the audience.

, If you have a problem with stage fright, you've got to learn to suppress it. There are a number of ways to do this, but probably the best is to fight it by singing a lot of karaoke. Don't take yourself too seriously up there, and even if you're nervous, show the audience that there's nothing you'd rather be doing.

, If you win, congratulations! Now be gracious. If you don't win, don't mope, don't make excuses, and don't get mad about how ""the contest was fixed."" You'll likely see these people again if you continue to compete in karaoke contests, and you want to leave them with a good impression of you.

Identify the break between the chest and upper registers.,
Find your own break.,
Practice alternating between chest voice and falsetto.,
Remember and practice the yodeling pattern with a knock-knock joke.,
Attempt a triad yodel.,
Sing triad yodels up and down a scale.",How to Yodel1," Yodeling requires you to switch between your chest register (normal voice) and upper register (falsetto). Where normal voice transitions to falsetto, there will be a break or voiceless gap in your tone.You’ll have to vocally jump back-and-forth across this break when yodeling.Your normal voice will vibrate your chest and have a mellow sound. The break occurs where your normal voice transitions up to breathier, shriller, non-chest vibrating tone, which is your falsetto.;
, This might sound painful, but it won’t hurt your voice at all. Pick a vowel sound, such as ""oh,"" and move your voice from a low rumble to as high as you can. Try that in reverse now. At some point between your chest voice and falsetto, you’ll hear the break.


The point at which your voice breaks will be unique to you. If you're having trouble finding yours, slowly descend from a high-pitched siren-like “Aow” until you feel the tone vibrate in your chest., You might be surprised at how much this works out your vocal chords. Keep relaxed and take frequent breaks, especially if your voice feels tired or overworked.Practice moving from low to high notes, making sure to emphasize the break.


Since yodeling alternates between consonants and vowel sounds, you might practice by singing a mid-range note in your chest as ""Yoh,"" then jump up to a high note in falsetto using ""Dee.""
Emphasize the break between chest voice and falsetto when you practice. Unlike other styles, where singers try to move smoothly from one note to the next, the break is essential for yodeling., Once you get the hang of it, the alternating consonant/vowel pattern of yodeling will come second nature. But until that day comes, you can use the following knock-knock joke when practicing:



Knock-knock. Who's there? Little old lady. Little-old-lady-WHO! Practice your yodel by singing ""little-old-lady-WHO."" Jump from chest voice to falsetto between ""lady"" and ""who."", Most styles of yodeling are founded around three notes: the triad. Try singing the notes middle A, E, then D to form a triad yodel. The A should be sung in your chest voice, while the E and D notes should be sung in your head voice.


You can listen to a reference to the tones for middle A, E, and D online, on an instrument tuner, a pitch pipe, or on instruments that hold tone well (like a piano).
Once you've mastered the triad, try putting the word ""yodel"" in front of it to sing ""yodel - A (Ay) - E (Ee) - D (Dee)!"", Try singing the same ""yodel-A-E-D"" pattern you did previously for each note on an eight-note scale. Sing your triad on middle C, then move up to middle D. Continue to scale up until you transition to high C, eight notes above where you started.


This may be easiest to do with an instrument playing the root note (starting note) of the triad as you sing it.

Breathe deeply to relax tension.,
Work out mouth and jaw tension with a self-massage.,
Limber up your lips with trills.,
Exercise your upper and lower registers with sirens.,
Round out your warmup with some scales.,
Cool down your voice to prevent strain.",How to Yodel2," You might not realize it, but tension can build up just from breathing. This can lead to tightness that worsens your tone when you sing. Keep your shoulders low and relaxed, take a normal breath, then exhale. Repeat this several times.

During this simple exercise, pay attention to your chest, neck, and shoulders. There should be no tension in these parts of your body.
You should feel your breathing in the area of your abdomen below your rib cage. This area should expand as you breathe., Tension also builds naturally in your jaw and mouth when speaking or singing. Relaxing this will improve your tone. Starting from the top of your jaw and working toward your chin, massage your face with the heels of your hands.Massage your face by kneading the muscles along your jaw and mouth in small circles, pressing gently inward and downward as you move toward your chin.
When massaging, your jaw should relax and open as you progress down your face to your chin. This happens naturally when tension leaves your jaw.

, Yodeling quickly jumps from sound to sound, so it’s a good idea to prepare your lips for these acrobatics. Trill your lips while you exhale so you sound like a horse. This may feel funny, but it’s an effective warmup.

Your lips should be placed together loosely as you exhale, causing them to flap together to create noise, somewhat similar to blowing a raspberry or pursing your lips for trumpet.Once you’ve practiced this a few times, try doing this with a “b” at the start. Practice the “b” trill in an ascending eight-note scale, from middle C to high C., This will warm up your upper and lower range, which is important when yodeling. With your mouth in an “o” shape, slide down from the highest pitch possible to the lowest while saying “woo.” Do this several times.You may feel like you have to belt out the volume on the really high or really low notes, but try to keep your volume moderate and consistent.
Reverse this process and siren up from your lowest note to the highest. Try this exercise while buzzing your lips like a kazoo., A two octave (16-note) scale is ideal. This will provide the best stretch for your vocal folds. Try a simple octave (eight-note) scale first, then increase the range little by little until you can do a whole two octave scale.

Try sliding up and down scales with a “me” sound. Next, try doing the same with an “ee” and “oo” sound. Humming scales is another great way of warming up.Avoid pushing your upper and lower vocal range when practicing scales, but do your best to stretch your range a little bit., Especially if you don’t sing regularly, warming up can be a lot of work. Cool off your voice with short, gentle glides that use an “mm” sound. After that, take a short five-minute break. Singing too long without breaks can strain your voice."

You may need to put in many hours of practice before you sound like an authentic Swiss milkmaid (or milklad) instead of a strangled cat. Persevere! When you master this, it’ll sound awesome.

, One of the best ways to improve your yodeling technique by imitating top-notch yodelers.There are loads of great yodeling videos and tutorials you can watch online.


If your heart yearns for alpine yodeling, check out the videos of Franzl Lang.
For cowboy yodeling, try Wylie Gustafson or America's Got Talent runner-up, Taylor Ware.For a classic example of yodeling in pop-culture, listen to the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” by the Tokens., You might be able to get your hands on some yodeling CD's for relatively cheap, but you could also order yodeling albums through online sellers. Listen to the yodeling experts on these albums and sing along to improve., This way you can involve your friends in fun and still get some practice. Teach your friends the basics of yodeling and encourage them to try. It’s as simple as that! Getting the hang of yodeling can be comical; enjoy the laughs that follow., You may have friends willing to yodel along, or to at least bear with you as you yodel. Search for other local yodelers on Facebook, Meetup.com, MEETin.org, or through a general online keyword search for “yodeling groups near me.”You might find fellow yodelers at a central European cultural center. Yodeling is still a popular traditional activity in countries like Germany, Austria, and Switzerland., If you can play an instrument, such as the guitar or piano, you could play along as you yodel. All the better! Singing along with an instrument will help you stay in tune and make your whole performance more impressive.


Even a simple instrument, like a harmonica, can interject variety in your yodeling and help you stay in tune."

If none of the above work, try taking classes.",How to Train Your Voice," The ""tips"" show certain valuable references on correct singing, such as raising the soft palate, breathing and posture, jaw placement, breath control, and other aspects. The steps provide vocal warm-ups which may be beneficial as part of a vocal training practice. Enjoy!;
, The object is to decline back down to the pitch ""do,"" by singing ""do, ti, la, so, fa, mi, re, do.""

, Start out by singing ""mi"" while moving the pitch up higher on the notes ""do re mi fa."" ""Ya"" is to be sung on ""so fa mi re do."" The note ""so"" is one pitch higher than ""fa,"" and therefore, it is necessary to imply on one pitch higher with the word ""ya"" before going back down the scale. Try to connect the notes and the words sung on the melody in a smooth fashion. This is called legato.

, Ascend the word ""ha"" on the notes ""do mi so,"" and descend the word ""ha"" on the notes ""mi do."" Sing this warm up in staccato, meaning, making each and every note short and separated, yet with control.It is best to place your hand on your stomach to make sure you are doing this exercise correctly. Each time you say ""ha"" while making sure the breath is coming from your diaphragm, you should feel a slight shaking feeling in your stomach, and the hand that is on it.

, Sing ""zi-ya"" on the pitches. ""Zi"" is to be sung on ""do re mi fa"" in legato. Make these notes smooth and connected. ""Ya"" is to be sung on ""so mi do."" It is supposedly sung in staccato. Make these notes short and separate, just like you sang ""ha."" Putting these concepts together requires practice, as it involves transitioning between concepts. When singing ""zi,"" try to keep the jaw relaxed. Do not open your mouth too wide. In fact,sing this note with a rounded mouth that is only slightly open. This way, you will achieve a soft sound that is round and full. When you sing ""ya,"" do not widen the mouth once again. Slightly elongate the shape of your mouth. Because this also involves arpeggiation to some extent, it is always best to leave your hand on your diaphragm.

, The entire range of notes from one ""do"" to the next is called an octave. As your vocal range expands, you may achieve the ability to sing several octaves. To practice this, a piano would be very helpful. Press the key of the note ""do"" on the piano. This may be anywhere, depending on the type of instrument you have, such as a soprano, alto, or mezzo. Note that your voice will be traveling in an uprising fashion, so choose the spot accordingly. Start from a pitch you can comfortably sing. If you are an alto, it is best to start at a spot further down on the piano. Likewise, if you sing soprano, start higher. Mezzos should find a spot somewhere in between, midway throughout the keys. If you do not know your vocal type, make an estimate and find what works for you. Press the key ""do"" on the piano, and match pitch with your voice. Hold out this note as long as you comfortably can. Then, press the ""do"" one octave higher than the one you were singing and match pitch, holding it out accordingly. If you find this is too high for you, either start lower from the beginning, or you could try half of an octave by going from ""do"" to ""so"" instead. After singing the higher note ""do"" match pitch with the lower one again and sing it out to a comfortable extent. If you are a beginner, this may be enough octave training for the day. If you choose to persevere and move on, try singing out the note ""re"" as long as you comfortably can, then matching pitch with the higher note ""re"" and holding it as long as you may. Then hold out the lower note ""re"" once more. Try this practice with the notes ""mi, fa,, so, la, ti, etc. depending on the stretch of your range. This exercise is intended to lengthen and strengthen the range of your vocal chords. Please be cautioned of straining your instrument.

, The symbol for ""do"" is a fist. The symbol for ""re"" is a slanted hand with the side of your hand facing towards you, as should your thumb. Your finger tips should point slightly to the left. The symbol for ""mi"" is a flat hand as if you were placing it on a desk, and the side of your hand should face you once again, as should your thumb. The symbol for ""fa"" is a thumb's down symbol with the inside of your thumb facing outward. The symbol for ""so"" is a flat hand with the palm facing outward. The symbol for ""la"" is a cupped hand that faces downward. The symbol for ""ti"" is a fist with the index finger pointing up and slightly to the left. Then, bring your index finger back into your fist to make ""do."" You could attempt to master this method by practicing it over and over to gain the ability to symbol the notes faster. This could be an enjoyable and inspirational way to practice, as it helps to signal the notes while singing each of them. See what works for you. :)

, Hold out this note to the extent of your comfort. Then, sing and signal the note ""re"" while holding it out. Then, go back down and sing the note ""do."" The object is to move on and sing from ""do"" to ""mi,"" then ""do"" to ""fa,"" then ""do"" to ""so,"" then ""do"" to ""la"" then ""do"" to ""ti,"" then ""do"" to ""do,"" or as far as desired.

Reach for low notes.",How to Warm Up Your Singing Voice," One of the first and easiest steps to warm up your body and your throat before you sing is to open your throat and diaphragm by yawning.

Gently force yourself to yawn by opening your mouth as though you were about to yawn. As you do this, think about yawning, or watch a video of someone yawning to initiate your own yawn.

Repeat this two or three times to fully open your throat and diaphragm.;
, Using your abdominal muscles and singing from the right place in your body are very important when you sing. To engage the muscles you should be using, very gently force yourself to let out a small cough. Pay attention to which muscles are involved in that action, as these are the muscles you should be using when you sing.The muscles of the core include the psoas, the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm, among others. Engaging these muscles during singing will help you achieve your fullest voice.

, You want your entire body to be relaxed when you sing, because you don’t want to strain your body or your muscles when you sing high notes. To relax your upper body, simply shrug your shoulders, hold them in a hunched position for five seconds, then relax them. Repeat four or five times.Your voice should always come from your diaphragm, but sometimes people will try to push from a higher place on their body instead of the belly when reaching for high notes.
To prevent this, continue relaxing your neck and shoulders throughout your warm up, especially when going for high notes.

, Because the breath is the mechanism that creates your voice, it’s also important to do a few breathing exercises before singing as well. Two exercises you can do are:As you keep your shoulders and chest relaxed, inhale deeply into your diaphragm, so that your stomach rises slightly. Then exhale slowly from this same place, so that your belly flattens out again. Continue breathing this way for two minutes.
Inhale like before, but when you exhale, practice allowing the breath to escape slowly as you make a hissing sound with your mouth. Repeat for one minute.

, Tension in your jaw and mouth can also affect your singing, so relax this area before singing. To release this tension:


Place your palms on your cheeks and allow your jaw to open to a natural position.
Slowly and gently move your hands around to massage the jaw and facial muscles for one to two minutes., Start by making a basic “hmmm” noise in your throat in your lower range as you exhale a breath. Repeat this five to 10 times, then repeat the same sound with your mouth open for five to 10 breaths. With your mouth open, you should make an “ahhhh” noise.Humming is a great way to warm up and relax the muscles of your throat, face, neck, and shoulders, and it can also help you control your breathing., Once your voice is warmed up with basic humming, begin to warm up for pitch changes by humming do-re-mi up the scale and then back down. Start at the lower end of your pitch range, and when you complete one sweep up and down the scale, go to a higher key and repeat.


Repeat this for four or five ascending keys, then work your way back down those same keys., Lip trills, also called lip buzzing or bubbling, are an exercise that vibrates and warms up your lips as well as your voice. To create the lip trill, you close your lips loosely, pout them slightly, and blow air through them (think of making the sound of a motor or raspberry). Do this for two exhales, then start slowly shaking your head from side to side as you do three or four more lip trills.Repeat the lip trilling and head shaking, and as you do this make a “b” sound with your mouth as you do vocal sweeps starting with a high note and going low, and then coming back up.

, Make an “ng” sound in your nose as though you were just saying the final part of the word “sung.” Continue to make this noise as you do three to five pitch sweeps. Every time you go back up and down again, push your voice into a slightly higher and lower pitch range.This exercise helps you warm up the voice gradually, prevents over-exertion of the voice, and helps singers transition between their head and chest voices,which refers to the different places air resonates in the body when creating different sounds and pitches.

, Tongue twisters are great for articulation practice, and if you say them in different pitches and at different volumes, they can be a great way to warm up before singing. Some good tongue twisters to try out are:Sally sells sea shells by the sea shore
Teaching ghosts to sing
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
Unique New York
The tip of the tongue, the lips, the teeth
Really rural
The big, black-backed bumblebee
Red letter, yellow letter

, Sometimes songs require a singer to hold a note for an extended period, and if you aren't prepared for this or don’t have the right technique, you may not be able to hold the note for the full length. To practice holding a note:

Expand your ribs, tuck in your lower belly, and relax your shoulders and neck.
Inhale slowly as you open your throat, arms, and chest, as though you were just surprised by something. Hold this openness while staying relaxed. This is the same technique you will use to hold a note.
Now, choose a note in the middle of your range, repeat the above steps, but this time sing that note and hold it for as long as you can, keeping your throat open and relaxed as you sustain the note.

, If you’re going to be singing a song that requires you to hit some high notes, there are ways you can practice for this. The problem with high notes is that you can damage your vocal chords if you strain too hard to hit the notes. To reach high notes without causing damage, you need to:Practice keeping a steady flow of air as you sing.
Keep all your muscles relaxed.
Keep all your resonance chambers (the throat, mouth, nose, chest, etc.) open as you sing.
Pick a song with high notes and practice it in sections until you become comfortable with each section.
Practice the song once through without singing the words: instead, vocalize a single sound to go through all the pitches. When you're comfortable with that, sing the song, words and all, through entirely.

, A song with low notes can also be difficult to master because with low notes, you can easily lose control of the sound, because your vocal chords relax as the pitch descends.To maintain control of your lower notes, it’s important to keep your throat relaxed and maintain resonance in your face.
If you stop feeling the resonance in your face as you reach for lower notes, shake your head from side to side to open your throat and try again.
Don’t worry if your volume drops with the lower notes, because lower notes cannot be sung at a loud volume. Instead, focus on maintaining the tone and clarity of the note, rather than the volume of your voice.

Listen to rock or metal or any other genre that has screaming in it, and see if you can understand the lyrics without reading them.,
Try to recreate the vocal style to see how you would say common words.,
Study a little harder in language because you would be surprised at how many big words some vocalists will use in their music.,
Listen to Punk Goes Pop albums or metal covers of other songs you do know the lyrics to.",How to Understand Screams (in Music)," If you can not, then read the song title so you can have an idea of what the song is about. Then try to figure out what would go with the subject of the song and at the same time sounds like the words the vocalist is screaming. You will not get it perfect, but you will have a better idea of the lyrics.;
, Even if you can't do it right it will still help you get a better idea. But if you do not know how to do this style of vocals correctly then DO NOT do this for too long because you can ruin your voice. If you insist on learning the correct technique, then there are many articles on the Internet on how to do this. Simply just Google search ""metal screaming"" or something of the sort.

, You must realise that a lot of the words that screaming vocalists are using will have an accent. Considering it is very hard to talk while screaming. An example is ""the"" may sound more like ""thuh"" and ""attack"" may sound more like ""attyack"" and ""will"" may sound more like ""weell"" and so on. A lot of the times screamers will scream one word for a long period of time making it very hard to understand. Try to follow along with the word as well as you can.

, This will help you understand how bands scream/growl certain words. Also, don't go straight into heavy bands and try to understand them, start off with lighter bands and get used to the sound, then go onto the heavier sound.

Teach scales.,
Teach intervals.,
Begin working on vowels.,
Work on focused tone and open throat.,
Begin learning songs.,
Give performance opportunities.",How to Teach Children to Sing," Not only is this important to teach the child to sing with good posture, but it actually teaches them how to properly participate in a voice lesson by giving them simple, achievable tasks to succeed. Children are very kinesthetic and love to do physical activities.;
, When breathing out, the stomach should tighten. The shoulders and chest should never raise or drop. You can work on this standing, or lying with a book on their stomach. Then practice hissing, buzzing, humming and eventually singing ""Ah"" by preparing with a good deep breath and steadily supporting with the stomach. Focus on getting good, even sounds while exhaling that do not sputter or die off.

, Practice long glissando ""sirens,"" lifting up into the upper register (sometimes called falsetto or head voice) for high notes, rather than ""belting"" or straining in the speaking voice. Their high voice will probably be weak at first but insist on its use and it will grow stronger over time. Children should learn to recognize the sensation of vibration in their mouth and chest for low notes and in their head for high notes.

, Teach them to match pitch and then to sing steps going higher and lower. Begin by having them sing ""ah"" and match their pitch with the piano. Then explore a couple steps up and down. Since many children do not immediately understand the concept of raising and lowering pitch, it can be demonstrated by the raising and lowering of your hand. Be patient if they don't get it right away, they usually do soon.

, Begin to practice 3 and 5 note major scales, using the solfege syllables Do Re Mi Fa So. Transpose the starting note up and down by half-steps as far as they can hold the pitch. Once they make good progress, try the whole scale (Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do).

, Begin to work on major/perfect intervals beginning with seconds and progressing to octaves. Always use solfege syllables.

, Make sure the child sings each vowel with the proper mouth shape. Make sure they open their mouths enough for Ah and Oh and round enough for Oh and Oo.

, Instruct them to ""sing through a yawn"" but with their tongue flat behind their bottom teeth. Work on tone by asking them to focus the vibration on the roof of their mouth. This is especially effective by having them hum and asking them to maximize the vibration on the roof of their mouth. Tones in the upper register will feel like they vibrate above the roof of the mouth, in the head and even above the head when high enough.

, Practice sight reading by first singing in solfege while watching the contour of the notes. Begin teaching children to read music this way. Then move on to holding the vowel sounds out to the length of the notes (rather than closing them off quickly as in normal speech) and singing with pure vowels.

, Learning to successfully perform is one of the indispensable experiences in voice lessons. Frequently conduct informal performances where the child will sing an entire song, facing you. Encourage students to sing for their parents and even friends, if they are comfortable with it. Finally, hold a recital every 6 months or so for which they can prepare 1-3 songs to perform for parents and other students.

To learn how to develop and push your voice, you've got to first figure out where your vocal range lies, so you can find good songs in your range and start working to expand your repertoire.


To start developing your vocal skills, sit down with a piano and sing notes that feel comfortable to sing clearly without struggling, then try to match your voice to that note on the piano. If it's a G, try finding songs in the key of G, or whatever key you match to naturally.;
, One of the interesting facets of the X-Factor, compared with other reality shows is that you'll receive coaching if you make it far enough into the show. But that doesn't mean that you can start from scratch. Building a good reputation with a singing coach will make you a good voice student, helping you to improve your skills and learn the necessary techniques to become a great singer.


A good teacher can help you learn fundamentals, as well as broaden your range of material. We can't listen to everything, so a good teacher will be able to suggest great songs that will showcase your voice, which you might have never even heard before.
Learning to take constructive criticism is extremely important and can be the difference between being a good singer and being a great singer who wins the show. Find a good teacher you can work with, who will show you how to improve and learn to take negative feedback that will make you better.

, Try to hit the really high notes and the really low notes within your voice range, then push yourself into developing a wider range of material. If you progress to the Boot Camp stage of X-Factor, what if they ask you to sing ""Tiny Dancer"" in D, when you've been singing in in B-flat? You'll only be able to pull it off if you've practiced pushing your range and exercising your voice.

, You can be a great singer, but without any charisma on stage, it'll be hard to win X-Factor. For that reason, it's just as important to develop your moves on stage as to develop your voice. It's not just a singing competition–you've got to have that ""x"" (extra) factor that makes you stand out, and part of the way to develop is to work on your stage presence.


It may be difficult to define ""presence,"" but easy to see. Check YouTube for vintage clips of Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, and Robert Plant to see the ""x"" factor at work.
Singing into a microphone is more complicated than it seems. It's a good idea to get some experience using a vocal mic and learning to use it to highlight your voice. You don't want to get up in front of the judges and blow out the mic, or hold it too far away and lose your vocal essence.

, Even if you know who's going to win, one of the best kinds of homework you can do is to watch how the winners negotiated the whole show. Who seemed to be the obvious winner in the early going? Who seemed to be the underdog? You can learn a lot about how to market yourself against the other competitors when you watch the others who've come before you.


Every finalist on the X-Factor has something distinctive about them. Find your individual unique qualities and decide how you'll highlight them over the course of the show. Plan for the long haul.
Come up with an ideal itinerary for what you'd like to accomplish throughout the season. If you want to be the underdog by the mid-way point in the season, how will you accomplish that?

, Audition sites are typically made public several months before the audition occurs, so keep a close watch on the X-Factor website for open calls and mobile van auditions. Follow the show on social networking to get instant updates and you won't have to worry about missing out.


Typically, you can fill out the registration paperwork online and file it before you show up on the day of the open calls. If not, you can still sign up your paperwork the day of, you just might end up waiting around a lot longer.
In the United States, open calls are typically held in a wide range of locations on the west coast, east coast, and throughout the south. Recently, there were open calls in LA, New Orleans, and New York City.
In the UK, lots of auditions happens with mobile vans, in which the judges travel to different locations for smaller-scale auditions.

, Before you show up, you need to have your song verse prepared, memorized perfectly, and practiced extensively. That should be the major focus of your audition preparation. A good song doesn't necessarily need to be famous, but it should highlight your voice perfectly. Bonus points for songs the judges aren't super-familiar with (since they won't be able to compare it to the original) or original songs you may have written.

, Make sure you get a good night of sleep before the audition, avoid alcohol for 24 hours before, and stay hydrated. Eat something before you show up, because the audition will probably end up taking all day.At most audition sites, overnight camping is prohibited the day before the audition, but try to find out how early you can get there. Either way, you'll probably end up being there all day, and there's no proof that earlier auditions go better than later ones, and vice versa. Show up when it's convenient for you and don't worry about performing.
To register at the audition, you'll need to show two forms of ID. If you're under 18, a parent must accompany you and present their ID. After you sign the registration paperwork, you'll receive a wristband and seat ticket, and then wait around for a long time for your name to be called.

, The worst part of the whole experience is negotiating the waiting period. You'll probably be both anxious and bored at the same time, so use the time effectively to relax, but also to stay warmed up for your performance. Do any vocal warm-ups you've practiced with your coach, and try to stay as calm as possible.


You'll see lots of intimidating-looking singers doing weird elaborate rituals, probably, but try your best to ignore what's going on around you and stay focused. Do what you know. It's not the time to change it up.

, When your name is called, the butterflies will kick it into high gear. Stay calm! If you've practiced effectively, you should be confident in your song and in your ability to nail the audition. Tell yourself, ""I've got this.""


Focus on the little details of your performance, getting the song right, hitting the notes, and throwing yourself into the performance. Don't worry about cameras, celebrities, and what the audition will mean. Just think about the song. That kind of dedication is partially what the judges will be looking for.
Don't fawn over the judges because they're celebrities. If you feel nervous, don't try to mask it with giddy enthusiasm. They're just people, so answer their questions sincerely and get to the performance as quickly as possible.
While you should be calm, it is true that creating a sense of drama seems to have some effect on the judges. If you've got a wild story about how you almost missed the bus that you needed to take to get to the audition, or that you're worried you'll lose your job to be there that day because you're so dedicated to your singing, it might help you stand out some.

, The number-one thing that the judges will be listening for is a star-making vocal performance. The ""x"" (extra) factor is important, and the look is important, but these are things that can be molded and improved (that's part of the X-Factor as a program–finding people with a duck-to-swan story). Don't worry about anything but singing your heart out.


Don't worry about winning the show during your audition. Just worry about making it through to the next round.
Make it clear that you're very serious about being a singing star. People who say ""this is my dream,"" is a big part of what the judges are looking for. They want stars who want to be stars, to give the people someone to root for.

, Wearing elaborate stage gear, playing tambourines, or doing any other gimmicky attempts at standing out will mostly just get the axe. It looks weird and the judges might laugh, but won't often be impressed. Don't over-think the audition. They're looking for your voice, not your sense of humor.


Acoustic guitars, however, do have a tendency to help you stand out from the crowd. If you play and have a song that could use some acoustic accompaniment, bring it with you if you're a competent player.

, You want to give the people someone to root for, and people tend to love a character with a big support system of family, friends, and locals behind them. It's a good story we can all get behind. If you can, get as many friends and family to come with you as possible, to scream with you when you come out of the audition with an invitation to the next round.

, X-Factor should be a marathon, not a sprint. No one performance, episode, or moment is going to win the show, so try to stay focused on the smallest possible tasks. Listen to the judges, take feedback constructively, work hard to improve your game, and get into the next round.


Not every one of your performances is going to be stellar, but each one needs to be good enough. Don't worry too much about being the best possible singer and performer every night, but try to focus on remaining consistent and reliable as a performer.

, You'll work alongside one of the judges and odds are you won't like everything they'll tell you. Your ability to take criticism and work hard to improve your performances will earn you bonus points, however, so it's important to keep a good head and respond well to feedback. X-Factor won't cater to divas and prima donnas, so check your ego at the door when you're going through bootcamp.


One part of the training process involves a makeover, and it can be a good idea to grow a bit of scruff before the makeover. If you transition from regular ol' you to Superstar You is especially dramatic, that'll play well with the judges and the fans. Part of the show is finding the most relatable character, the person with the most to root for, which can work in your favor during the makeover.
According to Demi Lovato, judge on X-Factor, the look is actually just as important, if not more so, than your voice. Take this part of the competition seriously.

, You want to present yourself as a multi-talented individual with a lot to offer your fans. One-note singers, even if they're talented, will quickly fall by the wayside in comparison to more complex performers and likable individuals. Great dancing, unusual hobbies, and quirky life stories all play well with the X-Factor judges, and with prospective record executives that might be watching the show and scouting talent.


Can you play piano? Sing in German? Break-dance like a fool? Save back some of these virtuosic talents for later in the programming, so you can stun everyone with a dramatic moment at the right time. If you suspect the judges might be getting tired of your act, you'll be able to throw a curveball.

, The winners of X-Factor, no matter how different in terms of style, substance, and skill all have one thing in common: serious hometown support. If you want to win the show, you've got to stay in touch with your roots and cultivate a serious following back home that will invest in your success and vote like mad.


Don't get too big for your britches. Make it a point to keep in touch with local press, sometimes at the expense of nationwide exposure. If you do a long-form interview with your local paper, emphasizing how much you love where you're from, how your roots are important to developing who you are, you'll have a sudden and rabid fan base who will fight for you.

, Take time out to develop your social networking presence and connect with your fans.


You'll like be extremely busy, so you might consider getting a close friend to help monitor the sudden deluge of emails, Facebook friend requests, and other media firestorm you'll encounter. Brief them on being polite, as they'll be your representative online.

, try to stay as flexible as possible and roll with the punches. It'll be almost impossible to prepare for everything you'll encounter, since the show changes somewhat from season to season, so you're likely to be surprised and jostled out of your routine by the strain of being on television. Be a good sport and be a professional, which is what the judges will be looking for. Act like you belong there.

, Remember when on that show you will be in the public eye, and a sudden rush of fame can launch some contestants into egotistical mode. So make sure you don't ""slam"" other acts or stars. Show the public the nice side of you. Get the public on your side. However don't make up an untrue sob story. When you get caught out no-one will want to buy your music.


Make sure the public knows that you want it. Be confident but make sure you don't appear to be only there for a laugh take the opportunity seriously because if you don't you will be voted off.

, While your performance of the songs you pick is by far the most important aspect of the show, song choice is still a critical part of your performance. If you're going to be a star performer who wins X-Factor, you need to prove that you've got a keen ear as well as a good voice, showing that you've got the right kind of taste in songs that will showcase your skills and connect with viewers.


Don't be afraid to get cheesy. Time-tested buzzwords for songs that connect on X-Factor include time, love, truth, chance, eternally, and always., The winners of X-Factor tend to be viewed as ""refreshing."" This means that there needs to be something in you that people haven't seen before, or at least haven't seen recently. If you sound just like Adele, or move around the stage just like Harry Styles, there'll be little reason for people to become invested in you.


Standing out can't come at the expense of marketability. Pulling a Marilyn Manson might make you much different than the rest of the field, but it's unlikely to connect to the type of people who watch X-Factor and vote. It needs to remain comfortably in the mainstream, which means you can't be too risky, subversive, or strange.
Ideally, X-Factor winners appeal to a wide variety of people: rockers, pop fans, tweens, grandparents. What can you do to make music that all of the above would be happy to listen to?

, On some level, we expect ""star behavior"" from stars. That means tantrums. That means weird habits. That means bowls of Lucky Charms with all the marshmallows removed, a la Britney Spears. To stand out, you don't want to appear in the news under the headline ""diva."" The newspapers have a big effect on what people think of you, so be careful and market yourself as a polite, down-to-earth performer who is preternaturally talented. You'll stand out that way.


Don't say anything to any judges, newspaper reporters, or cameras that you will regret. Being known as the girl who thought Tina Turner wrote ""Respect"" won't win you any fans with the judges or the press.

, The judges have succeeded in the music industry and you should take what they say seriously. They've been there, know what it takes, and will offer you constructive criticism. However, it's good to keep in mind that voters don't want to watch someone who'll be a wet blanket for a panel of celebrities. They want someone who will stand up for themselves at the right moment. Be your own advocate.

, One thing sells extremely well on X-Factor: sympathy. If you can get people to feel not only that you deserve to win, but that you've fought an uphill battle to get where you are, you'll be that much closer to winning. try to craft yourself as a sympathetic figure who deserves votes.


You need to have a good reason for having gotten into singing and performing. Maybe you remember your grandmother, who recently passed, singing you hymns when you were a child. Maybe the only way you could relate to your estranged brother was through music. Maybe you were picked on in school and took refuge in music. Find something people can connect with.
Packaging yourself as a sympathetic performer doesn't need to be over-the-top, and you shouldn't make anything up, but should try to frame something in a way that will make you seem more sympathetic. No one will root for someone who's been very lucky in life and lives relatively comfortably.

, You don't necessarily need to love a character to play them well.

, They take more effort and more memorizing, and if you are a beginner, it might be too much for you to handle. Many actresses started small, but were noticed in minor roles by talent scouts.

, It might be helpful to you later, if you get either of the parts.

, This will also tell you how long you have to practice.

, Here are some good questions.


Do you need to have a song or monologue prepared?
How long will the audition take?
What roles are available?
Will there be accompaniment or do you have to bring in a karaoke CD?

, Don't sing anything like rap or a rock song because it is a major turnoff for a casting director (unless that is what they're looking for.) If the show is something energetic such as Legally Blonde the Musical, you'll want to do an upbeat musical theatre song, not a ballad. Usually, they'll ask for about 16 measures (they can be 16 measures in a row that show off your range the best). Make sure it fits your range.


At other times you'll be given a song. In that case you will probably get it beforehand, if you don't ask.

, It doesn't have to be well-known, and if you mess up, don't let the directors know. Make something up, and when you remember the correct lines, begin to get back on track.

, If you aren't the best dancer, pretend to be. Sometimes personality can make up for your terrible dance moves. Always try your best and don't get discouraged if people move really fast. Smile!

, Often, the director(s) will not show much reaction to your performance, but that doesn't mean they aren't paying attention. If they cut you off midway through a song or monologue, it means they have heard enough to judge you on, not that you're bad.

, However, don't be too perky, that can come off as desperate and annoying.  Think of it as a showcase of your talent or a show you're putting on- that can help.

, It's fun! In musicals, the ensemble makes up most of the cast. Extras require less rehearsal time, and they have more dancing, singing, costumes, scenes, and general camaraderie, not to mention they don't have to worry about forgetting a thousand lines.

, Just because you didn't get a part doesn't always mean you don't deserve it, or that you are less talented than the person who did. Accept whatever happens with grace and never demand another audition. Always be kind and respectful to the directors, and the person who got the part you wanted, even if you are cursing at them inside. But try to avoid that too.

, Most tryouts are for main parts only - i.e., they're going to ask you to do a scene between the two lovebirds or a monologue for the main character of your gender.

,


Does your character have an accent? If so, should you try to replicate it?
Is the character messy or neat?
Does he/she have a spring in his step or does he/she mope around?
Is he/she mischievous?
Does he/she say lines confidently or is he/she less confident?
When asked beforehand, these kinds of questions can give you a head start.

, This can be good, because it gives you the adrenaline boost you need. The most important thing is to channel that energy into your performance.


If you are too nervous, you will need to calm yourself down. Deep breathing helps some people, so does biting your tongue, or shaking yourself. Different things work for different people. It doesn't matter how nervous you are, you need to make sure the other people who are auditioning can't tell. Be an actor and hide it. Directors will 'take into account' that you are petrified, because if they assume that if you can't act in front of three people, you won't be able to do it in front of a hundred. Whether this is true or not doesn't matter in an audition setting -- hide it.

, People act differently in restaurants in Hello Dolly than they do in the library in Music Man."" Keep these things in mind and keep your mind off the butterflies. Instead of remembering all the details, just absorb the scenarios you've practiced. You will be fine!

Maintain systemic hydration.You probably learned when you were young that your voice comes from your voice box, also called your larynx.,
Practice topical hydration.,
Rest your voice consistently.You may love singing, but if you want to do it well, you need to take breaks from time to time.,
Don’t smoke.,
Maintain a healthy lifestyle.,
Understand how breathing works.The most important muscle to be aware of is your diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle that stretches across the bottom of the rib cage.,
Be aware of your breathing.To improve your breath control, you need to be completely in tune with the entrance and exit of air from your body.,
Practice pulling your breath down into your body.,
Practice holding your breath in your body.,
Do exhalation exercises.,
Do vocal warmups before singing.,
Practice your scales.,
Practice pitching exercises.,
Record yourself singing.",How to Strengthen Your Singing Voice," The larynx contains muscles called “vocal folds” that are covered by a mucous membrane. For your vocal folds to vibrate properly and produce a clear voice, you must keep the mucous membrane hydrated. Systemic hydration means maintaining healthy hydration levels throughout the tissues of the body.


Long-term hydration is far more important than short-term hydration, so chugging water the day before a performance will not help you
Drink, at minimum, 8 glasses of pure water — not tea, not soft drinks — every day.
Avoid dehydrating drink that contain alcohol and caffeine.
Drink extra water to compensate for alcohol or caffeine if you drink them.
Avoid all carbonated drinks, even uncaffeinated ones, if they give you reflux.;
, Besides keeping your tissues internally hydrated, you can also keep your vocal cords moist and healthy through external means.


Sip your 8 glasses of water throughout the day instead large amounts at once. This will ensure consistent external hydration.
Chew gum and suck on hard candies to keep our salivary glands engaged.
Swallow saliva from time to time to clean out your throat without clearing it, which is bad for your vocal cords.
Maintain a humid environment. If you live in a dry climate, you can purchase a personal steam inhaler at a pharmacy or hold a hot wet towel over your mouth and nose for a few minutes.

, Just as athletes rest muscle groups for a day before working them out again, you need to rest the muscles that produce your voice to avoid injuring them through overwork.


If you practice or perform three days in a row, take one day off.
If you practice or perform five days in a row, take two days off.
Avoid speaking unnecessarily on a day-to-day basis if you have a rigorous singing schedule.

, Inhaling any kind of smoke, whether first or second-hand, dries out the vocal folds.Smoking can also decrease saliva production, which is important for topical hydration, and increase acid reflux, which can irritate throat tissues.The most important effects, though, are decreased lung capacity and function and increased coughing.

, Your instrument is your body, so you have to take care of it. Obesity is correlated with poor breath control, which is one of the most important skills a singer must master, so keep your weight down through a healthy diet and lifestyle.Avoid dairy products that create excess mucous that causes you to clear your throat.
Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, both of which dehydrate the body
Eat enough protein to handle the workout your vocal muscles are wearing out through regular use.Exercise regularly, both to keep your weight down and to improve your lung capacity and breath control.

, Contracting the diaphragm (inhaling) pushes down on the stomach and intestines to make room for air, and lowers air pressure in your chest, allowing you to take air into your lungs. To exhale, you can simply relax your diaphragm, which allows the air to leave your chest cavity at a natural rate, or you keep your diaphragm engaged against the stomach and intestines to control the rate of exhalation. The latter is very important for singing.

, Find a quiet, distraction-free environment where you can sit for a few minutes every day and just focus on how inhaling and exhaling feels in your body.

, Many people take very shallow breaths that will not help you breathe, so you need to learn how to breathe in a way that makes best use of your lung capabilities.


Inhale slowly and deeply, feeling the air move downward through your mouth and throat and into your body. Imagine that the air is very heavy.
Visualize pushing it all the way down below your belly button before letting yourself exhale.
As you go through repetitions, inhale more quickly. Continue to imagine the air being heavy and pushing it down into your stomach. Feel how your abdomen and lower back expand.
Place one hand on your chest, and the other on your stomach. When you inhale, make sure the hand on your stomach moves more than the one on your chest — you should be pulling air down deep into your body, not shallowly into your chest.

, After inhaling deeply and pulling the air down into your body, try controlling how long you can keep the air in your body without growing uncomfortable. Try to increase the length of time.


Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, making sure to draw your breath down into your abdomen like in the previous exercise. Try to hold it for a count of seven, then exhale.
Repeat several times.
Over time, try to increase the length of time you can hold your breath comfortably.

, Exhalation exercises are important for holding steady notes; without them, your voice might waver when you sing.


Inhale deeply through your mouth, pushing the air deep into your abdomen.
Instead of letting the air rush out at its own natural rate, keep your diaphragm engaged so you can control the rate of exhalation.
Take eight seconds to expel all the air from your chest.
Once you’ve exhaled, contract your abdominal muscles to push any remaining air from your lungs.
One of the most important parts of improving our breathing is making sure we exhale completely.

, You wouldn’t start running before you stretched out, because you could strain and injure the muscles in your leg; the same principle applies to the muscles involved with singing. Before you put your vocal cords through the stress of some serious singing, you want to make sure you warm up your voice so you don’t strain it.


Humming is a good way to ease into full-throated singing. Before you begin singing, practice some scales in a hum.
Lip trilling warms up the muscles involved with exhalation to prepare them for the controlled breathing required by singing.Keeping your lips pressed together, push air through them to create the sound we associate with being cold: brrrrrrrrr!.Move through your scales in this manner.

, Although singing songs is your ultimate goal, you should practice every day on plain old scales. This will help you gain control of your voice, stay on target with pitch, and move more easily between both adjacent and disparate notes.


Listen to Youtube videos to make sure you’re matching your pitch appropriately to the actual notes you should be hitting.Practice singing scales higher and lower than your most comfortable octave to increase your range.

, Pitching exercises like step intervals help you to move easily between notes without losing pitch. Intervals are the distance between two notes, and there are many different exercises you can do that take you through a wide range of vocal exercises.The seven basic Major intervals are Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th, Perfect 5th, Major 6th, Major 7th, and Perfect 8th, and you can find examples of these interval exercises easily online., Sometimes, it’s difficult to hear how we actual sound while we’re singing. Record yourself singing your scales, your pitching exercises, and your favorite songs to hear how you actually sound. You can’t improve if you can’t tell what you’re doing wrong!

The actual practice of throwing your voice is also known as the “distant effect” because it makes your voice sound as though it comes from a distance.
In order to throw your voice, you will need to rely on the pressure that comes from squeezing a large amount of air out through narrow passageways. As such, taking a large amount of air into your lungs is an essential first step.
Practice inhaling deeply without appearing and sounding obvious. Take large yet quiet breaths through your nose to avoid the “gasping” sound that comes from inhaling deeply through your mouth.;
, Position the back of your tongue so that it nearly touches your soft palate.


The soft palate is the soft portion of the roof of your mouth, located near your throat.
Use the back of your tongue rather than the tip. Your tongue should be near your soft palate without actually touching it.
This action closes off most of your throat. The opening of your throat will need to be narrowed like this in order to produce the muffled voice required for this effect.

, Pull your stomach in to tighten your diaphragm and apply pressure below your lungs.


The diaphragm is a muscle located directly below your lungs. It plays a role in inhalation and exhalation, and the deepest breaths you take are those for which you use your diaphragm.
Since the diaphragm is located directly below the lungs and around the upper stomach area, tightening or straining the muscles in your midsection will also tighten your diaphragm.
Placing pressure below your lungs constricts the passageway from your lungs to your mouth and nasal cavities. This constriction grants you greater control over your voice and is essential to trapping it inside your throat.

, Slowly exhale, making a groaning noise as your breath leaves your throat.


By keeping your airways constricted, you will trap your breath around your larynx. The resulting groan is locked inside your throat, making it sound distant.
Practice groaning in this manner several times until you feel comfortable about how trapped or distant the groaning sounds. Inhale deeply each time and constrict your muscles in the same manner, resting your throat when it begins feeling strained or pained.

, Repeat the inhaling and constricting techniques you used to control your groans. Instead of letting out a low groan, use a simple yet open sound like ""ahh.""


The ""ahh"" should be long. Start the sound as soon as you begin exhaling and continue it until you push all the air out of your lungs.
Note that the sound does not need to be loud, though. If anything, you should expect that the sound will seem muffled, since that is part of what makes it sound so distant. As you practice more, you can gradually work on making the sound louder. To start with, however, merely focus on trapping the noise in your throat.
Continue practicing this technique, making the ""ahh"" sound, until you feel comfortable with it. Stop if your throat begins to feel sore or pained.

, When you feel comfortable throwing the ""ahh"" sound, repeat the breathing and constricting techniques, replacing the ""ahh"" with a couple of words like ""help me.""


""Help me"" is a common phrase used in ventriloquism, since throwing one's voice is often used when creating the illusion of a talking puppet trapped in a chest or box. You could use other phrases, though, like ""let me out"" or ""over here!"" The words you choose are up to you, but it is best to keep them simple since throwing your voice strains your muscles.
Repeat this phrase as often as necessary until you feel comfortable with the resulting sound.

, Your practices should be no longer than 5 minutes at most.


Stop as soon as you feel any pain or severe strain in your throat or lungs.
Your larynx, vocal cords, and throat in general are being worked in unusual ways. To avoid damaging or severely straining them, your practice sessions need to be short and focused.
As you gain experience, you may be able to practice for slightly longer periods, but your practice sessions should always be fairly short.

, The three basic lip positions used when throwing your voice are the relaxed position, smile position, and open position.Create the relaxed position by slightly parting your lips. Keep your jaw loose so that your upper and lower rows of teeth are separated instead of held together.
The smile position is common in a ventriloquist act, but it is not used quite as often as the relaxed and open positions in producing the ""distant effect."" Create the smile position by holding your jaw and lips apart for the relaxed position. Exert the muscles at the corners of your lips, pulling your lips into a slight smile. Your lower lip will extend out slightly more than it would for a usual smile.
The open position is great when trying to express shock or surprise, but some tongue movement might be spotted. Hold your mouth agape so that the separation between your upper and lower jaws is noticeable. Keep the corners of your lips slightly upturned, essentially creating a more open version of the smile position.

, The easy sounds can be produced with little to no jaw movement. Practice each of these sounds in front of a mirror until you feel comfortable making them without excess mouth movement.


The long and short versions of all five vowels, A, E, I, O, and U, are included among the easy sounds.
The hard and soft C sounds and hard and soft G are also among the easy sounds.
Other easy sounds include D, H, J, K, L, N, Q, R, S, T, X, and Z.


, Challenging sounds, also known as labials, are made using an altered tongue position known as the ""front press"" or ""pull off"" position.


You usually produce sounds like B and M by momentarily closing your lips, but this movement is obvious and makes it difficult to convince others that the speech comes from a source other than your mouth.
Using the ""front press"" position, your tongue acts as a substitute for one lip.
Briefly touch the tip of your tongue to the back of your teeth, applying a light amount of pressure. Make this movement every time your lips would naturally close together to produce a sound.
Use this technique for the B, M, P, F, and V sounds. Note that these sounds will not sound as they normally do, but the altered versions produced by this technique are the closest you can come without moving your lips.
Do not use much pressure and do not touch the tongue to the roof of your mouth. If you do this, your B will sound like D and your M will sound like N.


, One way to misdirect those listening to you is to pretend that you are searching for the sound in the same way they might be searching.


Contrary to the way it may seem, throwing your voice does not mean that you will be able to ""bottle"" your voice and make it sound as though it is coming from a specific location. A close observer will clearly discover that the voice originates from you, even if you master the technique.Successfully throwing your voice relies on your ability to momentarily convince your audience or listener to look elsewhere for the sound of the voice.
People have a natural tendency to look off in directions that others look off in. By appearing as though you are ""searching"" for the source of the voice, you can cause many people to follow your eyes with their own, effectively joining you in your ""search"" for the source.

, After you finish “searching” for the source of the voice, a good way to keep the listener misdirected is by keeping your eyes locked on the fake source.


This action relies on the same misdirection principle used in searching for your fake source. Human curiosity causes people to look in the same direction that others are looking in. By fixing your gaze on an object or location, those listening to you will naturally follow your line of sight to that object or spot. They may break out of it the longer the illusion lasts, but their initial reaction will be to look where you look.

, Enhance the illusion by responding to your “thrown” words as though you were another person.


If you are saying something shocking or surprising, make gestures that indicate such an emotion. Raise your eyebrows, quickly cover your mouth with your hand in a phony gasp, or slap your hand to your forehead in mock disbelief.
Similarly, if you are listening to words that should anger you, cross your arms, turn your back to the source, or use other gestures to mimic the emotion of anger.

Navigate to “Import” > “Audio…”
Locate and double-click your MP3 track to open it.

, If this MP3 is in stereo, the track will show 2 channels. This means you’ll see 2 long visuals of the song (2 long waveforms) stacked on top of one another. You’ll also see the word “Stereo” in the sidebar just beneath the track name., Before making any final changes, you’ll want to select about 5-10 seconds of the song that has lead vocals so you can preview your changes. Here’s how:


Click the mouse in the time bar just above the track to play it from that spot. Find a place in the song where vocals occur for about 5-10 seconds.
Hover the mouse over the tracks until your cursor appears.
Click and drag to highlight the part of the song to preview.

, Now that you have a selection defined to preview, you can test removing the vocals.

, This effect helps remove vocals that are at the center of the track with other instruments spread around them. Most modern music is mixed this way, though there are exceptions., These settings define how the effect will run on the main vocals.


Leave “Action” set to “Vocal Reduction. This ensures that you’re reducing the vocals instead of reducing the music.
“Strength” should be “1,” which just means “apply this affect at it’s normal strength.” You may need to increase this to “2” later if the vocals are particularly loud.

, This value will determine the lowest frequency (Hz) to be removed from the track. You may have to come back and adjust these values later, depending on the result.


If the vocals you want to remove are very low and have a lot of bass (e.g. Barry White, Leonard Cohen), type “100” into the box.For vocals that are low but less bassy (e.g. Drake, Toni Braxton), start at “100.”
For most mid-range vocals (e.g. Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen) set this value to “120.”
For vocals that are very high (e.g., children’s voices, Mariah Carey), set this value to “150.” If you still hear the vocals perfectly after you make the change, you can come back and set this to “200.”

, This is the top frequency of the vocals. Going too high may cut out higher-pitched instruments in the song, but not going high enough may not capture all the vocals. You can always undo your changes and return to this screen to make adjustments.


For almost all vocals, setting this value to “7000” should work fine., Note that backup vocals can usually not be removed with this method, as they are often on a different track.


Note that if there's reverb on the vocals or other types of processing, the lead vocals will not disappear completely—you may hear a ""ghost"" vocal in the background. When you're singing over that, it will seem like it's your voice being reverberated!

, If the preview doesn’t sound the way you hoped:


If you find that a lot of the bass in the song is missing, try increasing the Low Cut value by 20 Hz until you find a good balance between bass and vocal-removal.
If deeper parts of the vocals are coming through, try reducing the Low Cut by 20 until a good balance is found.
Try setting Strength to “2” if adjusting the Low Cut doesn’t work.
If you’ve changed the parameters and hear no change to the vocals, this song is not mixed in a way that is compatible with this feature.

, When you’ve found parameters that sound good in the preview, click “OK” to filter the entire song. This may take a few minutes, depending on your computer and the length of the song.

, Listen to the main vocals—While you may not be able to remove every last trace of the vocals, you should be able to cut much of their sound using this filter as long as vocals are mixed in the center of the track.


To undo your changes, click “Edit > “Undo Vocal Reduction and Isolation.”

, Now that you’ve finished creating your instrumental track, it’s time to save it as an MP3 file.,, This is a matter of preference. A higher bit rate MP3 will take up more hard drive space but sound much better. A low bit rate means a smaller file, but it won’t sound as good. Note that since you’re editing a compressed file, you will lose a bit of quality in this process.


For a small file that still sounds amazing, set Bit Rate Mode to “Variable” and select “Best Quality.” This option should work great for almost anyone.
If you’re not worried about file size and need the highest possible quality, set the Bit Rate Mode to “Preset” and Quality to 320kbps. This will give you the best quality file Audacity can make.
If your goal is the tiniest file possible, set the Bit Rate Mode to “Variable” and choose anything lower than “3” (155-195 kbps).

, Browse to the folder where you’d like to save the file.

, Once the file is saved, you’ll be able to play it any application that supports MP3 files.

Don't give yourself ""Gospel Jaw.""",How to Sing Vibrato," You can do this simply by yawning.Try to keep that feeling of yawning in your mouth and throat while you sing. Can you mimic that feeling without even yawning, too?


Singing well (and singing with vibrato) is largely about being relaxed and open. If your throat is closed, the noise won't flow and your tone won't be warm and rich. You may be able to belt a few notes, but your full range will be cut off.;
, If you are not relaxed, you will not be able to sing with vibrato. It should come naturally if you relax and don't strain your voice. Shake out any tension from your wrists to your ankles. Do circles with your neck, stretching out the sides. Get loose on the outside so you can avoid tension on the inside.


This includes all the muscles in your face and head, too, like your jaw and tongue. They should be doing very little work, regardless of whether you're singing with a straight tone or with vibrato.

, In order to master breath flow (which is alarmingly important), keep good posture by standing with one foot slightly in front of the other, and your neck, head, and back all in a straight line. Subglottic pressure is actually regulated by your abs, lower back, chest, and butt muscles.If you're sitting, sit on the edge of your chair with your back straight and your head facing directly forward – you shouldn't be looking down, even if you're reading music.

, Take a good, solid, deep breath into your core. Your shoulders should not go up and your diaphragm should lower. When you sing the note, concentrate on it naturally cycling in front of you. Let it go on its own – it should do it for you.


Proper singing isn't work. If you're feeling like you're forcing out a specific sound, you're not doing it right. Vibrato is natural; don't bother forcing it if it's not there. It just means you need to concentrate on other aspects of singing first. Vibrato is the icing on the cake, not the flour in the batter. It comes last.

, Not breathing or breathing inconsistently is surprisingly easy to do while singing. To produce the sound you're aiming for, keep the amount of air you produce steady and even. If it's not steady, your vibrato will wobble all over the place.


In addition to being steady, your breath needs to be even to keep vibrato consistent. If it's not even, you may notice your vibrato slowing down or speeding up – both of which should be avoided.

, You've probably heard a few singers whose vibrato is so strong it takes over the song. It just won't stop, and it's a little distracting. Don't be this singer. Vibrato sounds much better when it's light and natural. It should be like surprise ice cream, not ice cream splattered all over you and splattered everywhere.


What's more, know when it's appropriate – which isn't all the time. If you sang a song entirely in a straight tone, that song wouldn't be aurally interesting. If you sang it entirely with vibrato, that song wouldn't be aurally interesting either. So use it sometimes, don't use it others, and switch it up. Use it when you feel like it fits.

, If vibrato doesn't come naturally to you, well, for starters, don't give yourself a hard time. Many pros fake it or do it incorrectly (more on this in a bit). Vibrato is trendy more than anything. That being said, continue to work on your singing and it'll come. When you have solid technique, vibrato will be a piece of cake.


Focus on your resonance and timbre, instead. You'll develop the right habits of singing freely, breathing properly, and being relaxed. You'll start placing the sounds correctly in your mouth, letting go of your jaw and tongue, and the vibrato will start spilling out.

, Some vocal teachers will help you concentrate on developing your ""vibrato"" by teaching you a few exercises that force it out. This isn't true vibrato – this is you imitating vibrato. If you're singing correctly, vibrato will develop – it's a natural physical result of singing correctly.


This is very much so an aspect of singing that comes with time. There's no magical way to develop it overnight. It takes a rich, healthy tone and proper breath support for it to even start – and you can't run before you walk.

, Technically speaking, vibrato is an even, steady tonal oscillation of a pitch's center. It's a slight variation in pitch and is the natural function of a well-produced tone.It cannot be naturally manipulated.


Most people believe that vibrato adds a warmth and depth to the voice. It's perceived by the ears as a pitch variant, but in actually it's part of the tone, centering it.

, Sure, vibrato sounds good, but it's also helpful for the voice. Not only does it center the pitch, but it also helps the muscles relax. It's your larynx pulsing in order to properly deal with the pressure that's being put upon it.It's there to protect your vocal folds from over-exertion.


Think about lifting weights. When your muscles are under duress, they automatically start shaking. Have you ever thought about why? It's a similar mechanism throughout your entire body.

, So many people ""fake their vibrato,"" which is to say that they don't actually have a true vibrato at all. Let's discuss ""trillo, ""wobble"", and ""tremolo"":Trillo. This sounds like a goat bleating, point blank. It sort of sounds like a very fast, staccato vibrato. It is caused by breath that has not properly placed and becomes dispersed.

Wobble. This is when the cycles occur slowly and far apart. There's usually a larger variation in pitch, too. It generally happens from a lack of focus in tone or poor breath management.

Tremolo. Juxtaposing the wobble (which is too slow), the tremolo is too fast. It comes about from too much glottal pressure, resulting in tension around the base of the tongue.

, Place your hands at the bottom of your chest and feel where your ribs come together in the middle. Now move your hands slightly below this point (it's the soft area a few centimeters above your belly button). Now sing a note on one pitch in your easy range – any note will do. As you're singing this note, push in gently with your hands. The key is to push in, then pull out, and push in, then pull out and so on. Try doing this at a rate of around 3 to 4 cycles a second.


For the record, this type of exercise generally produces a tremolo sound. The volume changes while pitch remains the same, which is not true vibrato. However, it can give you a good idea of what muscles are involved and start retraining your muscles.

, Some teachers instruct their students to hold a finger on their larynx and wiggle it up and down while singing on a sustained pitch. This will result in a strange sound similar to a vibrato, but again, not true vibrato. That being said, it can help get new muscles working in new ways.


Take these exercises with a grain of salt. As stated many times previously in this article, true, natural vibrato comes on its own. These are simply to get you and your voice thinking in different ways.

, Another method teachers employ is to have their students switch between two notes at quicker and quicker rates until it's reminiscent of vibrato. The aim is for 6-8 cycles per second.


As you can likely tell, this isn't vibrato either. It's a mimicking technique that gets close to the sound. Just make sure the two notes you're switching between are a semitone or less away from each other.

, You know those singers whose jaws move up and down with every hint of a vibrato cycle? This isn't how you're supposed to do it, whether you're Whitney Houston or not. Your jaw should be completely relaxed during singing, along with every other part of your body. So, yes, moving your jaw up and down can mimic that sound, but it's not natural or healthy.


This is often called ""Gospel Jaw"" because it's seen so prominently with Gospel singers. It's also called ""jaw vibrato"" as it's not emanating from your vocal folds – it's just vibrato produced with your jaw."

Choose a song for your solo that you can sing with ease, fits your vocal range, and fits the occasion you will be singing this solo for.,
Practice, practice, practice while smiling.,
Use a microphone and a speaker system (such as a karaoke player) as much as possible.,
Sing the song properly, whenever you get a chance (not joking around with the wording or tune), whether it is in the shower, getting ready for school, while brushing your hair, while playing cards, or even when you're on your way to school.

,
Sing the song in good form in front of trusted people, such as a voice coach, your positive-friends and family.,
Ask your friends and family for their constructive criticism of your singing of the song you chose; smile and accept any criticism to help you.,
Go back to your family/friends and re-sing the song for them, and ask whether you fixed what you did wrongly and whether there is anything else you still need to fix.,
Continue to practice the song for yourself whenever possible, and sing to your family/friends occasionally, and any other possible trusted audience.",How to Sing Your First Solo1," For example, if you will be singing this song at church and you have a high and low vocal range, you might want to sing Amazing Grace or How Great Is Our God.

, Keep practicing the song and smiling until you never want to hear it again, until you know it so well that you could just randomly start singing it in the middle of a large controlled group of kids (in a rehearsal or such) without a doubt in your ability to sing the song without any mistakes, and until you can sing it at a range of tempos.

, Avoid feedback (squealing speakers) caused by sound being re-picked up and repeatedly cycling through the mic and loudspeaker; so, face your karaoke player speaker. Get used to hearing yourself while singing with the mic. Get a longer cord so you can walk about a little, with the mic.


Use a unidirectional mic that picks up sound only from one direction, and then face the loudspeaker, as a monitor-speaker is better than having the loudspeaker behind you.
Avoid using an omnidirectional microphone (it picks up sound from all around). This type is useful for lower volume sound with acoustic music in a studio or on a sound-stage where speakers play in a separate soundproofed mixer/control room and/or audience speakers are far off to each side of the stage (and without any monitor speakers) to avoid feedback -- and performers might use cordless, in-ear monitors.

,, Avoid trying to impress jokers or wise guys. Doing plenty of this realistic practice can make it so much less nerve-racking when it comes to performance day.

, For instance: if someone says that you don't sing loudly enough, then practice singing louder (projecting) while continuing to sing the song properly (performing with a mic may not require loud voicing as the mic might be sensitive enough to pick up near whisper-levels, if that would be good in part of a song).

,


If there were something else that needed fixed, then use similar procedures as used before to fix it.







, Keep practicing, even if your family/friends said that everything was fixed.

, Try lukewarm water; it works best to keep your throat conditioned.

, Try to do some more in front of only your helpful family members and friends today, to ask whether you did a better job. If they say ""Good job!"" then congrats, but if they say, ""It could use some work on ____."", then don't worry; just work on any issue mentioned.

Find one area across the back wall above the heads of the audience to look at throughout your performance to keep you from getting distracted.

Begin singing the song.,
End the song; bow; smile, and after the crowd is done applauding, walk off of the stage with confidence and aplomb.

",How to Sing Your First Solo3,",

, Smile nicely and appropriately. But, don't wear a pasted on fake or embarrassed smile or a never ending silly grin.

, On many songs you can start laid back and relaxed -- increasing the feeling and mood as you go. Then end up by building to a crescendo/a climatic high point. Often songs, such as ballads, do not fit that format.

Learn to locate your diaphragm muscles.,
Practice breathing into your diaphragm.,
Do diaphragm-strenthening breathing exercises.,
Practice breathing exercises along with your singing.,
Always warm up first.,
Stand with excellent posture while singing.,
Sing with your throat open.,
Work on both ""parts"" of your voice.,
Work on pronouncing consonants.",How to Sing Using Your Diaphragm," Unlike your bicep, it's hard to feel your diaphragm muscles, so it's important to learn to learn to locate them, so you can go about strengthening them for singing.


The best way to think about singing from your diaphragm is to think of your diaphragm muscles as a platform or tabletop. They should be firm and stable and provide a foundation for your voice to rise through your air column.
If you're having trouble feeling your diaphragm, lie flat on the floor and place a moderate weight on your stomach area, something like a large book. Push that weight up using just the muscles in your stomach. Simultaneously draw air into your lungs to their full capacity. Now, sing. The muscles you're using are your diaphragm.;
, To breathe into your diaphragm, breathe in as deeply as you can and push your stomach out as far as possible while doing so, keeping the rest of your body as still as possible. Now exhale, and pull your stomach back in. Make sure your shoulders don't move.


It's imperative that these muscles you're using while breathing remain firm but not clenched when singing. Your chest, shoulder, and face muscles need to remain loose.
Imagine you're a chimney, and that your singing rises through the chimney from the diaphragm out of the lungs, and through the roof.

, Exercise your diaphragm muscles regularly. Once you've learned to breathe correctly, you need to get as much power into your diaphragm as possible. Take a deep breath from your diaphragm, and while exhaling, count as high as possible. Count slowly and evenly, then record how much you've improved every day.


Practice a ""milkshake."" Pretend you're sucking in through a straw. Remember to keep your shoulders and chest still. Hold your hand on your stomach to notice the movement.
Do ""dog pants."" Pant as if you're a tired dog, but again remember to keep your shoulders and chest still, and again hold your hand on your stomach.
Practice a ""bathroom push"" exercise. As ridiculous as it sounds, it really does help when learning to sing using your diaphragm. Keeping your shoulders and chest still, let out a hard breath as if you're struggling on the toilet. Hold your hand on your stomach.

, If you want to strengthen your diaphragm for singing, you need to incorporate these breathing exercises into your regular singing routine, as well as practicing breathing several times throughout the day. You can do it anywhere, at any time, relatively easily, since you don't need any special equipment or other materials. You just need your voice.


Practice breathing exercises while you're driving to work or while you're watching television. There's little excuse to avoid practicing something so easy. And you'll start noticing results in your singing quickly with the right dedication to practice.

, Breathing and vocal exercises are essential in warming up your voice before singing. Singing from your diaphragm is just one part of proper singing technique, and needs to be combined with other good practices. Anytime before you start singing for a long period of time, you should:


Take a long, deep breath and hold it for a few seconds then release it slowly. As you breathe in, raise your arms until your hands touch each other. Then put your arms down slowly while you breathe out. Do these three times to five times.
Start with the lowest note that you can sing and start getting higher until you reach the highest note you can sing, without straining. Don't rush. The slower, the better. This exercise helps to control your breathing and warm up your vocal chords for singing.

, When singing with your diaphragm, you are taking larger, fuller breaths. Doing this requires perfect posture. Keep your back very straight, your shoulders rolled back, and focus on keeping them still as you breathe to give your voice and your breath the best space possible.


Because your diaphragm is right below your rib cage, which encompasses your lungs, slouching pushes your ribs into your lungs and doesn't allow for the downward expansion necessary to get a good breath.

, Look in a mirror while you force a yawn, looking and feeling the openness in your throat. This needs to happen while you sing, but as relaxed and loose as possible. To allow the air to flow more freely and naturally from your diaphragm through your body, you need to practice singing with an open throat.


Pretend you've got a ball in your throat that's keeping it forced open. Practice singing runs of notes while your throat is open. It might take a while to get the notes as strong as you're used to, but it's an important part of retraining your voice to stay strong.

, Think about your voice as if it is broken into two separate, but linked parts. Your high notes are in what is called your head voice and your low notes are in your chest voice. To make full, rounded sound in each of your voices requires singing from the diaphragm, but learning to distinguish these two voices and move between them will help with note placement.


Use your breathing exercises regularly to get used to the sensation of moving between your two voices. Try singing intervals to jump back and forth between the two different voices and strengthen your transitions.

, Hard consonants often become inaudible when singing. Try repeating a consonant phrase like ""The tip of the tongue and the teeth and the lips."" Sing the phrase over and over on a single note, until every word can be sung clearly with full breath support from your diaphragm.

Resonate.,
Consider your pitch.,
Focus.,
Improve your quality.,
Work on your breathing.,
Focus your energy.,
Work on your confidence.",How to Sing Without a Vocal Coach," This is how you make your voice sound full. The most important part of resonance is knowing where you resonate. When you sing, there are two places where you should feel resonance: in the sinus cavities, right under your nose, and in your chest. You should be able to put your hands to these and feel them vibrate. This will help your voice fill a room. On a special note, singing in your sinus cavities can be difficult. When you hear that it's around the nose, a lot of people then try to sing through their nose, resulting in a very nasally sound, as if though they were singing with a stuffy nose. Rather, you want to feel a vibration on the roof of your mouth, just behind your teeth. Also, make sure you drop your jaw and your tongue in your mouth, to make sure that the sound has the most room to bounce around and build up.

, Being able to match pitches correctly is going to be another important part of singing. If someone sings perfectly, but out of tune, no one is going to want to hear them sing. Practice recording your voice along with a song, or while playing an instrument. When you play it back you should be able to hear whether your voice is too low, too high, or just right, and then you try singing a tiny bit lower or higher to make it right.

, Focus is what will determine whether or not people can understand you. Make sure you enunciate every word, and sing out of your mouth. If you just sing for the sake of singing, you will be very quiet and will sound like you're mumbling. So sing to something. If you're driving, sing to your steering wheel. If you're in the shower, sing to your brush or shampoo bottle. Just make sure you have somewhere to place your voice, because if the sound has nowhere to go, then it will just sit in your mouth and will not go anywhere.

, Now that you know all the rules, you can break them. If everyone sang the exact same way, completing each step just the same as everyone else, then there wouldn't be much variety of sounds. Everything I stated above about resonance, pitch, and focus can be slightly altered to sing how you want. If you want to sing for country music, well then it is okay to resonate through your nose a little. However, do not think that you can then just ignore anything stated above. Just like an athlete, you will not use every muscle when you play your sport, but you still need to keep them in shape to make sure everything else works smoothly. You need to know how to do these steps in order to know how to not do them.

, The most essential part of singing is breath control. Most of us have been breathing improperly our entire lives. This is an easy fix however, as breathing properly is something you can practice every time you inhale. When most people breathe in, their chests puff out a bit, and their shoulders raise. However, the diaphragm muscle that regulates the intake of air is located directly under our lungs, not in front of them as our breathing habits suggest. So, instead, when you take in a breath, what should happen is that your stomach puffs out a bit instead, as when you flex your diaphragm, it moves downward towards your abdomen. Try to act as if though you're pulling air into your stomach, rather than your lungs. If you're doing it really well, you should even feel your back puff out a little bit.;
, Another important part to singing is singing like you mean it! If you do everything else right, but if you sing without any energy, then you will be giving a lackluster performance. Even when you sing quietly, you can still be energetic by slightly over-emphasizing each word, and projecting your voice to the front of your mouth (more on that later).

, This is probably the hardest hurdle to overcome when one first begins singing. Make sure to smile and never look down to let everyone that not a shy type, It is safe to assume that if you are looking up tips on how to become a better singer, then you acknowledge that you are not a great singer. If you want to learn how to sing, however, then you need to sing like you're the best singer that the world has ever had. Naturally, this is hard for the more modest of you, but that doesn't mean you always have to practice voice in front of people. Sing in the shower, sing in your car, and sing when nobody's home. And then, when your ready, start singing in front of your friends and family. Before you know it, you'll have enough confidence to give a grade A performance in front of a large crowd of people.

"
"
Sing at home alone when you know no one is around to listen.,
Choose music that suits you.,
Drink water half an hour before you start singing to prevent mucus from forming in your throat and causing difficulties to occur while you're singing.,
Work on confidence by doing a number of things such as drama, and speech, maybe even dancing.,
Join a choir.,
Take voice lessons.,
Sing within a small group.,
Try a video first.,
Sing in front of family or friends.,
Sing for a larger audience.,
Step out on stage regularly and sing with confidence each time.",How to Sing when You're Shy," Ensure that the house free of any criticizing siblings that may tease you without reason. When alone, you'll be able to practice hitting those notes. Singing alone will also give you more confidence in your voice, and it will help warm you up to singing in front of other people once you're used to singing.;
, Because you are shy, you are going to want to pick quieter, softer pieces instead of loud ones that require a big and booming voice. Go online and search for your style of music to get a song that is best for you.

, Water will help your voice to sound less scratchy and keeps it smooth. It also keeps your throat hydrated before singing so that you won't have a dry throat in the middle of a song.


Avoid drinking any type of liquids that contain sugar or salt in them. Although you may believe that you're helping your throat keep hydrated when singing, you're actually making your throat scratchy. There is the danger of messing up your voice.
This step also applies for any sugary and/or salty foods (for example, pizza or candy).

, While you may not be interested in these activities, that's okay. A lot of people participate in plays to get more confidence. You don't have to have a big role, you just need to get used to speaking or now, singing, in front of others. Auditioning for a musical would be a great thing to do because you could be in the chorus. Chorus members don't sing alone. You also need to look in the mirror and tell yourself that you are a talented and fine person and that you rock!

, You never have to be solo in a choir unless you want to, so really this would be a great place to start in your case. Go ahead and have fun. Make new friends who also love to sing. You'd be surprised how many shy singers there are in choir.

, It will be just you and a professional, no need to be afraid! Yes, they are expensive, but you can tell your parents that you will work for it. Make it a goal, something you really want. You can after all do anything if you put your mind to it!

, Take the plunge and go ahead and sing within a small group of people. Once you can do this, you will be able to move on to the next stage.

, Once your confidence has reached a certain point in which you are now comfortable and familiar with your singing voice, take a video of you singing your favorite song and post it onto YouTube. This will help get your voice out there, and you'll also be able to review the comments you receive to help improve your voice and build your confidence.


Keep in mind that there are always going to be people you can't please, no matter how good your voice may be. Therefore, ignore the nasty, mean comments that attempt to put you down, for making you feel worthless and horrible is the goal of those bad comments. Instead, focus on the constructive ones that will help improve your voice and build your confidence.

, Letting your family know that you have a good voice can be helpful, and it'll start you off in being heard. Also, your family may be able to give you good advice and help you step by step. Once you've shown your family that you have a good voice, start singing in front of friends and get their opinion. That way, other people can hear your beautiful voice and your popularity may spread.


You don't necessarily have to gather your family and friends around in the living room so that you can perform for them. Simply sing for no reason when you're doing chores around your family members or doing homework with your friends. However, choose the correct opportunities and avoid disturbing needed silence. The moment when your family and friends need to concentrate on work may not be the best time to show off your voice. Use your discernment wisely.

, Congratulations! You've made it to the end of the goal. Now, keep your focus and be confident as you sing for more people. They will love you!

, Stay confident in yourself and your voice, no matter how mean or degrading other people may be towards you. Tell yourself that they're just jealous of your voice. As long as you know you have a good voice, you're all set to becoming a great singer! Remember that confidence is the important key to singing confidently and well. If you don't have confidence in yourself first, you won't be able to continue very far onto the stage. Never stop believing in yourself.

, Slide the note slightly a half-note up and then bring your singing voice all the way down to the lowest note you can comfortably sing. Sustain the lowest note you can without your voice cracking or popping., Bring your voice the fifth note from what you were singing. Play a piano note in tandem with your voice so that you can correctly raise the note a fifth. This is the note you'll be in when singing in your subharmonic range. This should also be one octave below your chest voice.If your chest voice is an A1 note your subharmonic tone should be in A2.

Sustain a subharmonic note and purse your lips.,
Push up from the back of your throat.,
Push down at the base of your tongue.,
Continue to hold the note.",How to Sing Subharmonics2," Purse your lips so that your mouth is shaped like an oval as you sustain your subharmonic note. This will allow your subharmonic register to resonate better., Build up your subtone note until it feels comfortable to hold it. As the pressure builds into your torso, push out the note from the back of your throat. The goal is to sing with both sets of vocal chords to produce your subharmonic tone., Tighten and flatten your tongue near the base of your tongue. Curl the tip of your tongue up slightly. This should distort the sound of your subharmonic tone., Keep practicing until it feels comfortable holding your subharmonic note. Continue to repeat the process until you can sing in your subharmonic tone. Don't practice singing subharmonics too much, however, or you may lose your voice."

Work with a professional.,
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.,
Be open and accepting of your voice.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Get lost in the song.",How to Sing With Confidence," If you've been singing classical or country this entire time, but really have a jazz voice, you may have been misleading yourself since day one. All the singers on the radio sing in their genre for a reason -- can you imagine Frank Sinatra, Josh Groban, or Michael Buble going country?!


You'll know it when you find it. It'll feel like being home. It may take a while, but once you experiment with pop, classical, country, musical theatre, jazz, blues, folk, opera and R&B, you'll know exactly what you're most comfortable doing and be able to narrow down your niche from there. If you have more than one genre, you may have to find a way to mix the two together.;
, You know how the more times you do something, the more comfortable (and better) you get at doing it? Well, the more times you sing, the more comfortable you'll get hearing it. The more comfortable you get hearing your own voice, the less you'll care about others hearing it, too.


Unfortunately, practice doesn't make perfect; it makes habit. So get into the habit of healthy singing. Practice good posture, breathe deeply, and stop when your voice feels strained.

, You wouldn't go running a marathon straight outta the barn, so why would you expect to be able to sing well from the get-go? Warming up your voice will ultimately relax you. Once you're relaxed, you'll be able to feel more confident.


Practice with lip trills, sirens, and arpeggios. Don't forget to use your entire body! In addition to keeping good posture (envision an invisible fishing line holding you up) and working out your diaphragm, relax your jaw muscles by rubbing them with your fingers and use your arms to swing up on high notes. The physicality is surprisingly helpful.

, Pick a handful of songs you know so well that you could do it with both eyes closed, your hands tied behind your back, and on one leg. You only want one thing to concentrate on: your voice.


That means having the tempo down, knowing your exits and entrances, when to slow down, when to speed up, and, if you have an accompanist, what the right notes are. If you know the song backwards, forwards, and sideways, you can fully concentrate on your technique. Then, when you go to sing, you'll only be thinking of your best possible sound.

, Quite obviously, the easiest way to boost your confidence is to learn more skills. You'll get better, learn more, and have someone cheering you along the way if you work with a vocal coach.


Express your concerns to your teacher. Let them know that this is an area you want to work on. As a result, they'll be likely to choose songs that stretch you and force a confidence from within. With enough practice, it'll become old hat.

, You will not grow if you do not take risks. And taking risks will sometimes backfire. But some of the time, it'll pay off grandly, and that's what matters. It's not making mistakes that's recommended, it's not being afraid to. Holding yourself back is the worst thing you can do for your confidence.


When we allow our voices to do whatever they want, it gets scary. You don't know what will come out. But if the result is beautiful, how would you know if you didn't do it? Once you start taking risks, you'll find territory you've never ventured into before. Maybe you'll find that confidence there, too.

, If you don't like it, it'll show on your face and in your body language. If you're uncomfortable, everyone will know. Regardless of what you sound like, love your voice. It's the only one you'll ever have.


Incredibly famous singers don't make it on their voices alone. Do Madonna and Britney Spears technically have great voices? No. They don't. Don't fool yourself that they do. What they do have are enigmatic personalities -- confidence to the core. If you're voice isn't fantastic, don't rule out being able to fool everyone that it is.

, Sometimes we see people who are having so much fun, we become ripe with envy. Singing works similarly -- if you're having fun with your voice, people are going to want to have fun with you. The millions of karaoke singers across the planet are not professional-level songsters and songstresses; they're just out to have a good time.


Relax. This is not brain surgery or chemical warfare; no one is going to die (including you) if you botch your performance. Whatever pressure you're putting on yourself is coming from you, so cut it out! If you enjoy yourself, no one can take that away from you.

, Those hundred people in front of you, all staring? They're not there anymore. You're just you, singing about how you got your heart broken, but you'll be okay. This song is yours. You aren't auditioning for State, you aren't putting yourself on the line, you're just emoting. Listen to the words and let them take you to a far off place.


Even if it's not in a language you understand, the music can still move you. If the song is sweet and like a lullaby, let the imagery envelop you. If it's daring and provocative, feed of its energy. Let the song form your environment, not reality.

Even worse, singing without warming up, especially singing a complex or challenging part, can do damage to your vocal folds and lead to vocal burnout., Limber up your body by performing a few basic stretches. Be sure you stretch your arms, chest, and back, as these body parts all connect to and affect your vocal tract and torso. A relaxed upper body will produce a better quality of sound while singing, and reduce the chance of vocal damage.


Massage your jaw to release tension contained in the muscles there and improve your vocal production. Using the heels of your hands or your fingertips, rub your face from below your cheekbone along your jawline toward your chin., A poorly hydrated voice can leave you sounding garbled or your tone impure. You should drink plenty of water before singing, keeping away from drinking anything too hot or too cold. Room temperature beverages are the kindest to your voice.Serious vocalists should aim to drink anywhere from six to eight glasses of water daily, though this number could change significantly based upon individual body type.You can put a little lemon juice into your water to add a dash of flavor and make your water more enjoyable., Aim for a two octave scale in extra short notes, as this will force your vocal folds to stretch more in preparation to sing. Start your scale from a pitch in your lower register, and smoothly ascend until you reach two octaves above your starting tone. Then smoothly descend to your starting pitch. Make sure to use your head-voice and sing from the diaphragm.


The key here is to give your voice a good stretch. You can perform this exercise with many different sounds and tones. Try singing on the using the sounds, ""me,"" ""ee,"" and ""oo."", This is a good way to warm up the vocal cords with minimal strain on your voice. Roll your tongue to sing an extended ""R"" sound, then ascend through the scale until you reach the highest note you can sing properly.

, Too much air on high notes will make your vocal cords dab against each other, which can war them out over time. Practice controlling your air flow with a voiceless ""S"" sound for 15–20 seconds at a time.


Look for tension in your voice when you sing high notes, as this is a sign of incorrect air flow.

, Also called diction, enunciation is how clearly you pronounce the words that you speak. Poor diction can lead to you getting tongue tied while singing, or can result in the words you sing being unclear. There are many different exercises you might employ for the sake of diction, some you might try saying:Red lorry, yellow lorry, red lorry, yellow lorry.
She sells sea-shells on the sea-shore. The shells she sells are sea-shells, I'm sure. For if she sells sea-shells on the sea-shore, then I'm sure she sells sea-shore shells.
Betty Botter bought a bit of butter. ""But,"" said she, ""This butter's bitter. If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter. But a bit of better butter, that will make my batter better."" Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter, better than the bitter butter, then she put it in her batter, now her bitter batter's better!, Relatively low soprano and mezzo-soprano parts can make it more difficult to sing dynamics clearly, so practice moving between forte, piano, and so on. Higher soprano parts require a great deal of air, so practice breathing exercises.

, The right posture will improve airflow and expand your vocal tract and torso to create the best sound. Even while sitting, the right posture can drastically improve the timbre and pitch of your voice. Generally, you should keep your spine erect, your shoulders back, and your chest held high, but comfortable.


Keep your chin approximately parallel to the floor.
Your stomach should be flat and firm, but ready to expand for abdominal breathing.
Keep your hands relaxed and at your sides.
Slightly bend your knees, never stand with knees locked.
Place your feet shoulder width apart, with one a little in front of the other.
If sitting, keep your back off the back of the chair., Proper breath management is critical for sounding your best while singing, and is necessary to sing with skill. The diaphragm, which is a muscle along the bottom of your rib cage, moves down into the torso when you breath to make room in your lungs for air. This is what vocal instructors mean when they say, ""Breathe from your stomach."" What they mean is, ""Breathe with your diaphragm in a controlled fashion.""


The more control you have over your breathing, the more breath support you'll be able to bring to your singing, creating a richer, fuller tone.
When properly breathing with your diaphragm, you should feel a slight expansion and contraction when you breathe in the area between your sternum and belly button., Interval training can help you train your voice to greater precision. Since arpeggios are the notes of a chord sung in progression, this exercise is perfect for training sopranos. You'll likely have to make frequent, large interval jumps as a soprano, and practicing arpeggios will prepare you for this.If you are familiar with solfège, the arpeggio interval will fall on the notes Do-Me-Sol-Do for a full octave. On a keyboard, in the key of C this would translate to the ascending intervals middle C-E-G-high C., Work on perfecting the quality of the notes you can reach before you try to push past them to a higher or lower range. If you try exercises to extend your range higher, do so gradually and scale back your efforts immediately if your voice feels strained or hoarse. To avoid damaging your voice, work closely with a vocal coach if you are trying to make a significant change to your vocal range.


If you notice strain, fatigue, or discomfort in your voice or throat, you may be singing a song that is too challenging., Give your voice time to recover after each practice sessions, taking a break from shouts, whispers, or other strains. Stop singing as soon as your voice feels strained, or your may cause long-lasting damage.

, Singing with other people can be a great benefit to your voice. Not only will you be able to listen to the voices of other talented performers, but you'll also be able to see how these people perform. Ask questions of your choir mates about their method and tricks they use to improve their vocal quality and produce gorgeous sound.A large choir may divide their sopranos into two parts. First sopranos sing the highest notes and sometimes a descant (the higher melody). Second sopranos sing a slightly lower part.

, The opera world divides sopranos into five categories: coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic. Parts written for different types of soprano may have slightly different ranges, and call for different vocal qualities. Figure out which type of soprano singing plays to your strengths, and focus on it.

, While a small minority of sopranos may sing for their own pleasure, the overwhelming majority of vocalists sing to be heard. The atmosphere of performances, however, will be very different from your relaxed practice sessions, so you'll need to practice performing as well. To do this you might:Volunteer to sing at a community event.
Join a community choral group to gain performance experience.
Form your own choral group with friends, classmates, or coworkers.

, A voice coach will guide you through typical soprano exercises while putting a well-trained musical ear to work for the betterment of your voice. Your voice coach can also help you identify weak points in your ability, and will assign exercises to you to improve these shortcomings.

, The state of your body will influence the state of your voice. Just like sinus congestion leave you sounding nasally, a fit and trim body can help you attain a more consistent, purer vocal quality. A vocalist's instrument is her body, so you should:



Eat a balanced diet.

Do light exercise to maintain your soprano physique., Many vocalists wish to push their abilities to the next level by stretching their voice. In some cases, this can result in pushing too hard, doing sometimes irreparable damage to the voice. Always be sure to listen to your body when singing and practicing singing. If you ever feel voice fatigue or notice uncharacteristic changes in your voice, you should consult a professional.Some doctors are vocalist specialists, though if this kind of expert is not available to you, you may wish to consult an ears, nose, and throat doctor.

, Certain substances can dry out your vocal folds, like caffeine and alcohol for example. Dry vocal folds will not be able to perform as well, so you should avoid these substances. Smoking can also irritate your voice, and can even cause changes in the tissue of your vocal folds., This kind of procedure is use to check for irregularities on your vocal folds, like nodules and hemorrhages. Without proper treatment, these conditions or other pathologies can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to your voice."

Classical singers perform unamplified and access a much wider range than singers in most other genres. Learning to do this requires the assistance of an excellent teacher. The National Association of Teachers of Singing directory can help you find one., Listen to great singers performing a variety of operas for inspiration and to discover which composers and periods of opera most appeal to you.


Browse videos and audio clips online, check your local library for recordings of operas, and consider subscribing to services like Met Opera on Demand. As you listen to these recordings, remember that it is important to develop your own unique voice rather than strive to imitate other singers.
It's important to seek out video recordings, not just audio recordings. Observing singers' stage movement and facial engagement is an important part of your introduction to the acting skill opera singers must develop.

, Watching videos can help, but nothing can compare with attending a live performance to truly experience the full impact of opera. Many major cities have opera performances seasonally, if not year-around.

, If you want to sing opera either as a professional or as a serious hobbyist, you must gradually develop a working knowledge at minimum of Italian, German, and French. That means understanding the basic grammatical structure of each of these languages and have enough vocabulary to be able to translate your own scores. You must know what every single word you're singing means, and what every single word your scene partner is singing means, even if there's a prompter to help you. You should have creditable diction in every language you sing in, although the will répétiteur working with the entire chorus and soloists may cover this too; so you also understand the cadence and flow of the language of the work that's being put on. Learning some some simple art songs in Italian is a great way to begin. , Become conversant about this body of repertoire, familiarizing yourself with the music, composer, and performance histories and styles of frequently performed operas..

, Opera singers are categorized as soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, or bass, and within each of these ranges there are subcategories determined by the color, volume and flexibility of each voice. The term for operatic voice type is ""Fach"". It will probably take a number of years of training to determine what your voice type and most appropriate repertoire and roles will likely be. , All classical musicians must become highly skilled at reading music. You can no more interpret an opera score to learn a role without reading music than an actor would be able to learn a Shakespeare role without reading English.

, Good alignment is essential for singing and has an impact on every aspect of your technique . Taking very deep breaths is a necessary skill for singing opera, and a relaxed but upright posture is important for effective vocal delivery.


Examine your breathing for any unnecessary tensions in your abdomen or throat, such as holding in your stomach or creating an audible gasp on inhalation. Practice taking deep breaths first slowly and then more quickly without introducing tension in the throat or abdomen.

, Weekly one-on-one lessons with a qualified voice teacher are essential for developing your technique. The National Association of Teachers of Singing hosts a directory that can help you find a teacher in your area Work with a professional coach. Voice teachers train vocal technique, coaches specialize in helping singers improve musicianship, dramatic interpretation, diction and performance practice. They will help you polish your repertoire and presentation.
If you live in a city with a strong arts community, seek out the coaches that the professional singers in your area work with. They will often be willing to work with less experienced singers and will hold you to a high standard. They may also may be able to introduce you to influential people in the opera world.
Contact local arts organizations for referrals to professional voice teachers and vocal coaches. You can also turn to online databases or a websites, but be sure to read reviews or testimonials. If not available, get in touch with the teacher or coach and to ask for a few references.

, Vocal exercises should never cause pain or hoarseness.


If you feel any strain or discomfort during your lesson, let your teacher know right away. This will help them understand your voice better and adjust their methods to keep your voice free while you are working.
If you feel any strain or discomfort while practicing on your own, it may be that you are trying to sing too high. low, or loud for your current level of ability. Back off, and be sure to ask your teacher how you can practice more efficiently.

, Many conservatories and college music departments have a preparatory or extension division that offer classes for musicians in the community. Opera workshops offer opportunities to study arias and opera scenes in a group setting, providing useful feedback and performance experience in a low-pressure environment.

, Wear stable shoes and keep your knees gently flexed rather than locked. Your pelvis should be in neutral rather than tilted forwards or backwards. Keep your chest high and shoulders back rather than slouching. Your neck and jaw should remain relaxed so that your head does not unintentionally tilt either up or down. , Learn to inhale fully, expanding in both the abdominal area and rib cage, and then release your breath effortlessly without pushing.


Maintain good alignment, with relaxed shoulders and a high sternum, while exhaling and singing.
Avoid pushing with your abdominal muscles or squeezing your rib cage closed while singing.
Learn to inhale with a relaxed throat, without making an audible gasping sound.

, The way you habitually form vowels and consonants while speaking is not free and resonant enough for classical singing, so you need to learn new and better ways to make each sound. In speech, your jaw, tongue and lips all move together but they are capable of moving independently from one another in ways that are much more efficient for singing.

, ""Legato"" means ""line"" in Italian. It is important to master singing sustained, steady lines before moving on to faster, more rhythmic passages.


Practice sustaining long phrases on pure vowel sounds. Give your vocal lines steady direction rather than letting your energy fluctuate when you move from note to note.
Practice releasing your breath steadily rather than allowing it to slow down and speed up over the course of each phrase.

, Coloratura is one of the defining elements of opera. It is the inclusion of special vocal improvisations within a musical piece. This may include scales, trills, arpeggios, and appoggiatura. A scale is an ascending set of pitches. An arpeggio is when the notes of a chord are articulated, being sung one after another instead of all at once. Appoggiatura is a vocal embellishment where the singer begins with the “wrong” note (a different pitch than is required) but then slides her voice into the correct pitch—commonly thought of as a dissonance that resolves in a consonance. , Opera singing requires a great deal of stamina. By practicing every day, your voice will get used to being used frequently and you will condition yourself to the hard work of opera.


You may not want to practice if you are sick, particularly if you have a lot of nasal drainage. The mucous could irritate your vocal cords. Take the opportunity to practice informally too—for example, put on an opera CD in your car and sing along with it during your commute. This may not be a substitute for a more formal practice, but it will help.

, Particularly if you are not working with a teacher, you need to get used to listening to your own singing and giving yourself constructive feedback. Listen for breathing, pitch, pronunciation, and tension in your voice. , Using your core muscles, rather than just singing in your throat, will help you sing louder and develop your stamina. Your core muscles are the most important muscles for opera singing, and you may want to strengthen them as part of your practice regimen. , Unlike other types of singers, opera singers do not use microphones; instead, they learn how to amplify their voice so that it delivers clearly over a large space. Find an acoustically appropriate practice space: a small room may cause you to limit your volume.
Try to increase your volume without straining your voice. Moving the source of your breath and song from your throat down into your core will help increase your volume.
Consider singing outdoors or in a very large room.

, Begin by focusing and breathing, then set goals for the day’s practice.Be sure to warm up your voice fully before attempting to sing notes at the top or bottom end of your range.
You may find that your voice is different in the morning. Consider practicing later in the day.

, You may decide that you want to become a professional opera singer if you have a very good voice, great tone, and good pitch. You may want to develop your acting skills alongside your singing.


Find out where auditions are being held. Be sure you know what you are expected to have prepared for the audition and be ready to perform your best.
Consider moving to an area where opera is very popular and more opera singing jobs are offered. This may mean relocating to a large city or even to another country. , While community theatres may not host opera productions frequently, they will likely host several musical theatre productions each year. Consider trying out for a part in an upcoming musical—you may even get free vocal coaching from the music director for being in the cast.

, If you love to be around singing and singers but don’t want to sing professionally, consider training to become a vocal coach. You can help teach other aspiring singers how to use their voices beautifully.

Match pitches on a digital tuner, piano, or guitar.,
Select a target note.,
Sing major scales.,
Sing major arpeggios.",How to Sing on Pitch1," The ability to hear, recognize, and then match a pitch with your voice is a fundamental ear training skill. While some people have a natural ear, others are “tone deaf.” If you are “tone deaf,” you develop this skill through consistent practice.


Find a digital tuner, piano, or acoustic guitar. Digital tuners are ideal for this exercise because the tool tells you if you are too sharp or too flat. If you don’t have access to any of these tools or instruments, there are several vocal match websites and apps available for you to choose from.;
, A target note is the musical note that you wish to match in pitch. You can choose any note within your vocal range—you could start by trying to match pitch with the lowest ""C"" in your vocal range. As you move through the exercise, continue to pick random notes that fall within your vocal range and attempt to match their pitch.


Play the target note on the digital tuner, piano, or guitar.
Listen to the pitch carefully. Try to hear the note in your head. This ability to hear, or visualize, a note in your head is called auralizing. This skill is developed over time and through persistent practice.
Sing the target note. If you are using a digital tuner, look at the screen to see if you have perfectly matched the pitch, if you are flat, or if you are sharp. If you are off key, slide your pitch up or down until you perfectly match the pitch.
Once you have matched pitch, select a new target note and repeat the process.
It may take you awhile to find notes that are within your vocal range and you are comfortable singing. Don’t be afraid to experiment with notes in different octaves., Scales are musical exercises that go up and down in a predetermined pattern. Major scales are the most predictable and familiar. Scales are extremely adaptable and personalized exercises. When you sing scales, you can focus on mastering a specific technique, such as vibrato, overcoming a certain problem, like pitchiness, or increasing your vocal range.


Play a major scale on a piano or acoustic guitar. The C Major scale is an excellent place to start. The C Major scale follows this pattern: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, C, B, A, G, F, E, D, C.
Listen to each pitch and visualize the note in your head.
Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the scale, focus on matching and maintaining each pitch.
After mastering one major scale, move on to another major scale. Repeat the process., Arpeggios, like scales, are musical exercises. Instead of moving up and down from pitch to pitch, arpeggios go up and down in intervals. Practicing arpeggios will not only improve your pitch, but they will also enhance your ability to jump from one pitch to another pitch as you sing.


Play a major arpeggio on a piano or acoustic guitar. Basic arpeggios follow this pattern: 1, 3 (Major Third), 5 (Perfect Fifth), 8, 5 (Perfect Fifth) , 3 (Major Third), 1. Start with the C Major arpeggio. It follows this pattern: C (1), E (3, Major Third), G (5, Perfect Fifth), C (8), G (5, Perfect Fifth), E (3, Major Third), C (1).
Listen to each pitch and interval. As you hear the notes, visualize the pitches and intervals in your head.
Play the exercise and sing along. As you move up and down the arpeggio, strive to match and maintain each pitch. Pay particular attention to hitting each interval.
After mastering the C Major Arpeggio, work on another Major Arpeggio. Repeat the process."

Stand in the correct singing posture.,
Correct a sharp pitch.,
Correct a flat pitch.",How to Sing on Pitch2," If you are struggling to sing on pitch, your posture may be to blame. When you stand in the correct posture, you will have an easier time producing the right pitch and controlling your voice. To stand in the correct singing posture:


Place your feet slightly apart with one foot just in front of the other front. Transfer the weight of your body from your heels to your toes.
Maintain a slight bend in your knees. Never lock your knees.
Place your hands at your sides. Keep your hands relaxed.
Your stomach should be flat and firm, yet expandable.
Pull your shoulders back and down.
Your chest should be held high.
Keep your chin parallel to the floor., If you are singing sharp, you are singing above the intended pitch. This may be caused by tense abdominal muscles, a locked jaw, or lack of focus. You can correct for these problems by:


Relaxing your muscles and softening your tone.
Singing with less force.
Monitoring your jaw for tightness and relaxing it when it begins to tense up.
Working on your breath control.
Monitoring your voice closely and remain focused., If you are singing flat, you are signing below the target pitch. This may be caused by fatigue, inability to focus or support your breath, singing outside of your vocal range, relaxed facial muscles, or the inability to properly monitor your voice. You can correct your flat tone by:


Improving your breath support.
Visualizing approaching the pitch from above instead of below.
Keeping your chin parallel to the floor.
Raising your eyebrows and or smiling.
Changing the key of the song.
Monitoring your voice closely.
Getting adequate rest before a performance or lesson."

Explore the concept of audiation.,
Sing a familiar song out loud.,
Sing every other line of the familiar song while visualizing the rest.,
Sing only specific words of the familiar song while visualizing the rest.",How to Sing on Pitch3," In the 1970s, Edwin Gordon developed the term audiation. The concept of audiation pertains to the concept of auditory imagery, or the ability to hear, or visualize, sounds in your head. In order to understand audiation, work through the exercise described below:


Select a song that is incredibly familiar to you. It could be your nation’s national anthem or a song from your childhood, like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.”
Don’t hum or sing this song. Instead, think about it—visualize the familiar melody in your head.
The ability to hear this song in your head without humming, singing, or listening to it, is called audiation.

, Select a familiar song—it can be the same song you choose before. Find a quiet spot where you can focus and sing without being disturbed. Once situated, sing the song out loud. As you sing, commit the following to your memory:


The melody.
The pitch of each note.
The intervals between each set of notes., When you feel confident in your knowledge of the song, enhance your audiation skills by visualizing a small portion of the song. Starting at the top of the tune, sing every other line out loud. When you are not singing, visualize the line of the song in your head.


The first note of the lines you sing may be extremely challenging to sing in tune. As your audiation skills improve, however, you should be able to hit the note right away.
Continue to count as you visualize the lines., Once you have mastered singing and visualizing alternating lines, you can attempt a more challenging audiation exercise. Select a few words to sing from each line.


Sing the first word of the song.
Visualize the portions of the song that lie in between the words you have chosen to sing.
Try your best to hit the correct pitch of the words you are singing."

Practice with a vocal coach.",How to Sing Low Notes," Voices are made up of 3 registers. These registers are the chest register, the head register, and the middle register. Each register corresponds to the range of notes you will sing from that section of your body.Head voice is the higher register of your singing voice. When you sing high notes, the vibrations will resonate in your head or skull. Put your hand on the crown of your head and the back of your neck as you sing higher notes to feel the vibrations.Chest voice is the lower register of your singing voice. When you sing low notes, the vibrations will resonate in your chest.
Middle voice is the middle register between your chest voice and head voice. It may feel more like chest or head voice, depending on your range. This is where your voice will transition from the chest to the head to properly sing the notes.;
, Everyone has a natural register to their voice. Some people have nasal voices while others have a chest voice. If you have a nasal voice, you sing higher and may have difficulty with low notes. If you have a chest voice, you can sing lower notes.


Place your hand on your nose. Talk to yourself. Then place your hand on your chest. Say the same thing you said before. Where did you feel the vibration? If you felt it in the nose, you have a nasal voice; if you felt it in the chest, you have a chest voice. If you feel it in both areas, you have a balanced voice and can sing both high and low notes equally., Your vocal chords have to relax as you lower your pitch.Tension in your vocal chords is going to result in the notes getting stuck in your throat. As you go higher, your notes will have less sound and power, or will sound like you are shouting.Warming up your voice before singing helps you relax the muscles. It gets the blood flowing and loosens the muscles in the throat so you can sing properly.
To relax your vocal chords, release a sigh. Let the sigh go down as low as you can vocalize. Roll your shoulders to release tension, and then move your neck from side to side. Sometimes you can relax your vocal chords by reducing the tension in that area.Also try moving your head back to look up, and then lowering your chin to your chest. Make sure to drop your shoulders and relax.Expand the back as you inhale to relax the vocal chords. This is especially helpful when you are going from high notes to low notes.
Train yourself to relax the outer muscles of the larynx. To sing properly, only the inner muscles are need., When you sing, you want to keep the notes high in your head, using only your inner throat muscles. When the notes fall back into your throat, you start engaging your swallowing muscles, which shouldn't be used for singing. You will be able to feel the notes if they are in your throat instead of higher in your head. By activating your swallowing muscles, you limit your tone quality as well as your vocal range.


Put your hands on your cheeks while singing. Try to keep the sound above your cheeks. This will help keep the notes from dropping down into your throat.
Visualize that you are singing up when singing a low note. This can help counteract the urge to drop the note., Water helps relax your vocal chords. After drinking water, find the most comfortable note you can hit. Make an ""ah"" sound and let your voice drift lower. Try to do intervals of 5 as you move on to lower notes. Keep drinking water as you do this to keep your vocal chords relaxed.


Don't force your voice down. It should naturally drift. If the tone starts to sound bad or you find your voice hurting, stop.

, Singing low notes takes less power, and the notes will have less volume. Sometimes when singing low notes, the rib cage is not lifted as much as it should be. This causes less power and less support of the notes.Make sure to breathe properly when singing low notes. Breathe using the diaphragm, and hold the ribs high without letting them droop.
Push your stomach in when singing the note.

, As you go between singing high notes to low notes, you need to switch gears. If you continue to sing in the same register even as you sing lower, you'll hit a plateau where your notes start sounding awful.You need to move from the head into the chest.


As you descend from head voice to middle voice, the sounds thicken. With each note, you should feel the sound moving from head to mouth or neck. Practice descending scales over and over, and practice them slowly until you start to transition from the head into the mouth and finally your chest for low notes., Not all voices are made to do the same thing. You may not be able to sing low notes if you are a soprano. This can be frustrating, but you must perfect and work with the instrument you were given., When you feel resonance in your face while singing low notes, you are controlling your low notes. This is exceptionally important since you don't want to lose control of your low notes. Start by humming. You should feel some kind of vibration in your face. If you don't, shake your head slowly from side to side so you can relax your throat. Continue practicing for as long as it takes to feel the resonance.


When you feel facial resonance, hold a note in the middle of your range by singing ""Mee."" Gradually lower the pitch of the ""Mee""s.
Your volume will decrease, but the vibration in your face should still be there and your tone should sound good., To sing low notes, you should increase your range. This should be done gradually so as not to damage your voice. As you work on increasing your lower range, do it one note at a time. You want to perfect each new note so that it is well supported, feels comfortable, and sounds good before trying to add more notes. You never want to continue lowering your register if the notes are incorrect, strained, or sound terrible.


Work on increasing your range by practicing short exercises where you sing through a small interval of one half or full step at a time., Many people speak with chest voice instead of head voice. To get the notes into the low range, start by speaking the words in your lower register. This can put your vocal chords in the right position.After saying the words, sing the same words. Your vocal chords should be at the correct spot to sing in the lower register.
If you are going from high to low notes, think about speaking the words. Set your mouth and voice up for speaking the words, but sing them instead. This can help you while singing. If you have practiced speaking and then singing, it may be easier to think it and adopt the proper vocal chord position.

, Tapping your chest while singing helps you feel the vibration in your chest, which indicates you are singing with chest voice. The point of this exercise is for you to feel the sound vibrating in your chest so that you are singing the low notes in the right register.

, Vocal coaches are trained singers who can help you with your technique. They can help you develop your ranges properly and improve your tone without damaging your voice.


No matter what level singer you are, if you are serious about improving your low notes, working with a professional may help you develop proper technique. A professional vocal coach can also point out weaknesses and suggest ways to improve.

Listen to Justin Bieber sing and try to imitate him.,
Improve your vocal agility.You will need to have good command of your voice in high and low registers to tackle some of Justin's songs.Begin by singing slow, even arpeggios.,
Switch singing from your chest to falsetto.,
Sing with a husky voice.,
Practice daily.",How to Sing Like Justin Bieber1," Even if you can't hit notes like Justin right away, you can learn the words to his songs. A big part of singing a Justin Bieber song like Justin Bieber is knowing the lyrics.


If you aren't a singer, you may want to start with a voice lesson to help learn the basics of singing. Once you have the basics down, you can move on to learning more of the advanced singing techniques used by Justin.
Try singing some of Justin's earlier songs first. For example, ""Baby"" is a catchy pop song, and it has repetitive lyrics that are easy to memorize.;
, Arpeggios are the individual notes that make up a musical chord. Practice singing them from lowest to highest, then highest to lowest. Don't worry about your speed, but focus on keeping your tone and volume even through the notes. Record your performances and then assess your progress. Work on different vowel sounds. Build speed as your skills improve. Practice melismas. Melismas are also commonly referred to as vocal runs. It is the ability to hold one syllable and change the pitch of your voice to hit many different notes.
Try singing songs like ""Beauty And The Beat"" by Justin Bieber. The song features a number of vocal runs and really shows off Justin's range and vocal agility.

, Justin has a vocal style that switches often between the chest, or normal singing range, into falsetto. Falsetto is higher pitched and tends to come through your throat and nasal passages. When you sing in falsetto, it may often sound like you're making a little boy voice. This will help to hit some of the high, soft notes in Justin's music while being able to quickly shift back to singing from the chest.


Try singing the chorus on ""As Long As You Love Me."" Notice how Justin switches from his chest voice to falsetto and back to his chest voice while saying the word love.

, Justin's voice has a husky quality that gives him a bit of a rough edge.Keep your neck muscles tense and exhale a lot of air while you sing to create a little raspiness to your voice. You shouldn't try to do this all the time, just try adding it here and there on certain songs. Listen to ""Sorry"" and notice where Justin's voice becomes a bit raspy in the chorus, then transitions back into a smoother tone.

, If you are young then you have a better chance at improving your voice. You will want to practice improving these techniques for an hour or two a day to make the most progress possible. Justin has been singing almost his whole life, so if you want to develop the talent to sing like him you need to be committed to working hard on a regular basis.


Be confident. Practice until you can hit the notes confidently and sing them with the same ease as Justin.

Write lyrics that have similar topics to Justin Bieber's song.",How to Sing Like Justin Bieber2," If you really want to sing like Justin, you need to practice your stage presence.


Study hip-hop dance.Try taking a hip-hop dance class to work on your moves. Most of Justin's choreography in his performances appear relatively simple, however, it is very difficult to pull them off while singing. It takes a lot of practice.
Gesture at the audience. Just likes to do a lot of pointing. Find a cute girl and point her way. She will probably pass out. You can also try doing a cute little shrug or making a heart shape with your thumbs and forefingers.Watch some Justin Bieber music videos, such as the video for ""Confident."" Study some of Justin's moves and try to copy them.

, Wear a lot of hoodies, with baseball caps, and Wayfarer sunglasses. Wear bright, expensive basketball sneakers, with skinny pants or tight jeans.

Use good body posture.,
Loosen tension in your jaw and neck.,
Use your diaphragm to sing louder.,
Use forward placement when you sing.,
Perform breathing exercises.,
Do vocal exercises.",How to Sing Louder1," Stand up straight so your shoulders aren't hunched forward. Try to keep your head facing straight. Relax your hands and avoid locking your knees. If you have to sit down while you sing, keep your back straight against the chair and keep your shoulders pulled back. Your abdomen should be flat and firm, not slumped forward.Proper posture will help your breathing, which can improve vocal tone and projection.;
, If you keep your neck and jaw clenched, your musical tone will be unbalanced and it can strain or damage your voice over time. As you begin to sing louder in a song, especially on higher notes, it’s natural for your jaw to hold some tension. This is because your chin will naturally start to drift upward. Make an effort to point it down at the ground. This will help loosen jaw tension. Try to keep your jaw hanging loosely.Avoid opening your jaw as wide as it will go or it can actually close off your throat, which won't help you sing louder.

, When you sing, the power should come from deep in your breath, rather than your throat. The diaphragm, a muscle attached to your lungs, helps your lungs expand so you can take deep breaths and control your voice. Check to see if you're taking full breaths by looking at yourself in the mirror. You shouldn't see your shoulders move as you breathe. Instead, you should simply feel like you're pushing down as you breathe.If you’re having trouble regulating your breath, lay down on the ground and place a book on your stomach. Practice moving this book up and down by taking full deep breaths. This is how you should breathe when you sing.

, Placement is a singing technique in which you make resonating sounds or vibrations to get a full loud sound. To do forward placement (or ""the mask""), you should feel the volume of your voice in front of your face, behind your mouth, on your cheeks, and possibly along your forehead. Pull your voice up through the soft palate and out through the front of your face.You may feel a slight vibration in your nose, but don't worry. When done correctly, using forward placement will give you a deep sound that isn't nasally.

, Being able to breathe deeply will strengthen the muscles you need for singing, making it easier to sing louder. Practice breathing exercises every day. While breathing exercises are important, it's also critical to have good posture and do forward placement. For a good simple breathing exercise:Lay on your back with your hands on your waist. Take a full breath and focus on expanding your stomach from bottom to top. This should make your hands raise up and out if you do it correctly. Once your breath is comfortably full, breathe out slowly to a count of 5. Repeat this exercise 10 times.

, You should always warm up the muscles you'll need to sing, especially if you're trying to sing louder. Vocal exercises can prevent damage to your muscles while building your vocal strength. Practice lip trills by blowing air through your closed but relaxed lips. You should sing an ""uh"" vowel sound. You'll feel your your lips trill, if done correctly.For a simpler exercise, make the 'ng"" sound (like at the end of the word ""lung""). Keep making the sound to practice moving your tongue against your soft palate.

Practice your songs.,
Relax your breathing.,
Focus on your passion.,
Work with a vocal teacher.",How to Sing Louder2," When you’re performing and nervous, it’s natural to get a bit quieter. Before you perform, practice your songs until you can sing them without even thinking about it. Knowing you're prepared can give you the confidence you need to sing loudly and clearly. It may even calm your nerves.Be sure to select songs that work with your vocal range. If you're unsure whether a song will work with your range, ask your vocal coach for feedback.

, While breathing exercises will strengthen your muscles and open up your lungs for full breaths, avoid taking deep breaths and holding them. When you're nervous about singing, just try to breathe normally. Stay relaxed so you're not creating tension.Practice your breathing before you begin singing. Do something simple like count your breaths in and out. For example, breathe in for five counts and release for five counts. Continue doing this until you're calm and ready to sing.

, Remind yourself why you want to sing. Chances are, if you keep your mind on your love for singing, you'll overcome your anxiety and be able to sing loudly and clearly. To help you focus, consider closing your eyes and paying attention to the words of the sing. Really let your emotions come through the music and worry less about your fears.If you close your eyes, remember not to tilt your chin upward, which can make it harder to sing loudly.

, One of the most helpful things you can do to sing louder, is to find a vocal teacher. A voice coach can give you valuable feedback on your singing technique. It will also be useful to have someone to tell you if you are, in fact, singing louder than before. Listen to your teacher's suggestions for improvement and remember that your teacher is there to help you become a better singer.Find a vocal teacher who specializes in a genre of singing that you want to do.

Sing right into the middle of the microphone.,
Sing with your lips almost touching the microphone.,
Soften your ""P"" or ""B"" sounds.,
Adjust your singing to fit the song.",How to Sing Louder3," Singing directly into the center of the microphone will pick up the best range of sound in your voice. You should still project your voice to the back of the room, but don't be afraid to sing into the microphone.Practice using the microphone and ask a friend or vocal coach to tell you how loud you are. Try singing directly into the microphone and compare it to singing into the side of the microphone. Ask for feedback about your volume.

, You'll need to be very close to the microphone for it to pick up your voice. You lips should almost touch the microphone if you're singing softly and if you sing loudly, your lips should be a few centimeters from the mic.If you stand too far back from the microphone, the mic probably won't be able to pick up your voice.

, If you're singing close to the microphone, some words can make a loud popping noise. Move your mouth slightly to the side of the microphone when singing words that start with ""P"" or ""B."" After the word, direct your face back to the center of the microphone.You only need to move a little to the side of the microphone. Don't worry if you still get occasional pops while singing. This is to be expected with using a microphone.

, Plan on how you'll use your microphone for each song. Sing through the song, moving closer during slower or quieter parts and back away from the microphone during parts of the song that require you to speed up, sing louder, or sing at a higher pitch.Use the microphone to your advantage. It can easily amplify your voice during softer parts of a song and you can back away a few inches when you need your sound to really pop.

Use your chest voice more.,
Practice gradually getting louder.,
Once you are a bit used to being louder than usual, sing along to songs that use louder voices.,
Get confidence.",How to Sing Loud Without Harming Yourself1," It's a bit harder to belt it with your head voice. But, with your chest voice, you can get a much more audible sound. And if you are worried that you won't be able to get as high as you want to sing, you would be surprised as to as high your chest voice can go. Just keep experimenting with it, and in no time, you should be able to get pretty high.;
, Don't immediately get loud if you're a quiet singer; you might end up hurting or straining your voice. Rather, practice slowly getting louder. Try some vocal warm-ups where you stay on one note and slowly get louder. Then, grow softer. Repeat that a few times to get the feel of how loud you can really go without hurting your voice.

, Now, don't do anything with screaming; that will definitely strain your voice. Just do songs that you feel your voice is comfortable with, and you can gradually move your way up to louder songs. Just nothing with screaming or intense shouting.

, One of the key things to singing louder is having confidence. Dare yourself to sing louder in public places, like choir or church. When you build up confidence, your voice will naturally be louder.

Revise your rap with your friends' suggestions.",How to Write Rap Rhymes," You might also choose something that you feel strongly about, like a loss, a love, or a struggle in your life. The fact is, you're going to have to spend time crafting your rhyme word by word. If your subject isn't meaningful to you, you'll likely find that the lyrics you come up with are uninspired and struggle with finishing your rap.For more advanced rappers, you might want to go out of your way to choose topics that you aren't passionate about. Experienced rhymesters can sharpen their skills on the challenge posed by less interesting subjects.;
, Do this long form, in several paragraphs or a large block of text. Try to include different perspectives about your topic, emotional points, and related concepts. This will help you build a pool of themes from which you can draw when working on the rhymes in your rap..


The more intimately you know your subject and ideas associated with it, the more ammunition you will have when writing. To further develop your topic, you might want to journal about it over the course of a few days.
Ask your friends and people who might be part of your target audience about personal experiences they have had with your topic. This may yield useful examples for your rhyme writing., There are many different patterns of rhyme you can utilize in your rap. This is called ""rhyme scheme,"" and it is usually expressed by representing same-rhyme lines with the same letter. For example, if your first and second line rhyme, and your third and forth line have a different rhyme but also are the same, the rhyme scheme would be AABB. An example of this might look like, ""I am a rapper, / Not a lip flapper / I don't play a game / My rhymes are never lame."" Some classical rhyme schemes you might try include:


A Boy Named Sue rhyme scheme: AABCCBBallade rhyme scheme: ABABBCBCEnclosed rhyme scheme: ABBA""Fire and Ice"" rhyme scheme: ABAABCBCBOde rhyme scheme: ABABCDECDEThe Raven rhyme scheme: ABCBBB, Now that you've got a pretty solid idea what topic you'll be rapping about and the kind of rhyme scheme you'll be using, it's time you brainstormed potential useful rhymes. For example, if you know you'll be rapping about a romantic situation and you plan on using the word ""love,"" you may want write up as many rhymes for this word as you can.A rhyming dictionary can be a tremendous asset when trying to find rhymes for particular terms. Many free rhyming dictionaries can be found online through a general Internet search.

, Most musical lyrics, including rap, make use of poetry techniques. Slant rhyme, for example, creates an imperfect rhyme between two similar sounding words, like orange and door hinge.This example also illustrates a multi-syllable rhyme, where one syllable of a multi-syllable word rhymes with a previous word. Another example of a multi-syllable rhyme (sometimes called a ""multi"") would be ""I don't make any false rhyme claim / No more than I'd disrespect your grand dame.""Another important part of the structure of your rhymes is syllable structure. The syllables in each line will create a beat in your rap. Generally, by drawing out a line with too many syllables, or making a line too short with too few syllables, you can disrupt the beat of your rap. Avoid this by trying to balance rhyming lines to have the same number of beats., As the saying goes, you can achieve greater heights by standing on the shoulders of giants. Look at the structure of one of your favorite rappers rhymes and, using your own topic, try to imitate it.Once you're satisfied with that, try to put your own spin or flavor on the rap. You could play with the rhyme structure, add a line to see if it builds tension, and so on.

, The general outline for most rap songs follows the pattern of Intro → Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Verse 3 → Chorus → Outro.Depending on your content, speed of delivery, and the effect you want to have on your audience, your verses and chorus could be long or short, your verses could be short and your chorus longer, or any arrangement you choose.


As an example, if you are trying to write a rhyme to get the club hyped, you'll probably want to keep your verses short and full of punch. Opposite of this, a slam poetry jam might do better with longer verses to tell a more engaging story.

, If the opening of your rap doesn't have a hook, you might lose the interest of your audience with the first verse. A powerful statement works well for opening your rap, or a hook that catches the audience's interest. You might hint that things are not what they seem, or that something is about to happen., Since your chorus will likely be repeated multiple times, you'll want it to be catchy but not repetitive. This can be a difficult task, and you might have to spend some time tweaking it until you are satisfied. Your chorus should generally be related to your topic and should connect to your verses. Think of your chorus as a bridge that connects all the parts of your rap together.You could make your chorus strong by making it the central point of your rap. For example, if you're rapping about an old friend, you might use a chorus like, ""He and I, we both came up / When times were lean and days were rough / And though we were just two young pups / He said we'd never be good enough / But I told him 'I'm not giving' up' .""

, It may help you to determine the goal in each verse before you start writing the words and trying to rhyme. For example, in a rap about romance you might decide that Verse 1 should be about loneliness, Verse 2 about falling in love, Verse 3 about where you think that love will lead.


Once you have a general idea for your verses, it's time to start writing! Use the ideas you've come up with when writing about your topic, the key words and the rhymes for those key words you've brainstormed, and write those verses., Especially when you have been working on a rhyme for a long time, it can start to sound funny in your head. Or sometimes you might imagine a rhyme is stronger or sounds better in your head than it does when spoken. To prevent your rhymes from falling flat when being performed, read them out loud to yourself and others., You can pull a beat off a wordless karaoke track or from samples on common audio production software like Evernote, Fruity Loops, GarageBand, or Ableton, to name a few. You might also have a friend who is musically talented help you out by making a simple beat on a drum kit.An affordable option to get a beat for your rap that won't require equipment is beat-boxing. Simply have a friend with beat-boxing talent accompany you as you rap.

, You'll want to have a good feel for its rhythm and tonal movement up and down, which is also called cadence. This will help you to rap in a way that flows smoothly in time with the beat.


Steady rhythm is a great way of checking your rap for syllabic balance. If the syllables in your lines don't match up evenly to the beat, you may have to remove or add some words.

, Ask some friends who know how to rap to read yours. After they have, ask for suggestions or if they think there are any weak points you could improve. You might also want to read your rap to an impartial audience. Sometimes friends or family can be too nice when giving feedback.

, Make sure to keep the flow of the rhymes going while you improve the rap. Stick to your rhyme scheme, keep syllabic balance between lines, and take pride in all your hard work.

Work on holding long notes.,
Use airy tones.,
Learn to belt.,
Work on a clear tone.",How to Sing Like Mariah Carey1," Carey is known for being able to hold long notes (up to 20 seconds).Practice holding notes for as long as you can. Chose a single syllable and note, like ""ah.""
Take a deep breath, and then try to hold the note as long as you can. Time yourself while you do it, so you can see improvement.
Practice every day to improve your lung capacity over time.;
, Carey tends to pull into airy tones sometimes after hitting high notes. However, only use these sparingly, as most voice coaches consider this a vocal weakness. Carey backs hers up with strong, belted notes that phase into airy tones.Most amateur singers have no trouble with airy notes, as airy notes are created by improper technique. It's the strong, belted notes that are more difficult.

, Belting is the ability to pull your chest voice into your head voice.Separate your chest voice from your head voice. Your chest voice is your mid-range voice. You'll notice the vibrations from singing are mostly in your chest. As you go higher in your range, you'll feel your head voice kick in, as the sound moves from the front of your mouth to the back.Choose a space where you can make as much noise as you want. Relax any tension in your shoulders by taking some deep breaths.Lower your jaw, and lift your soft palate.The soft palate is the roof of your mouth. Lifting the soft palate creates a better, more resonant sound. Using a mirror, say ""hung-ah,"" and see how your palate moves. You should be able to feel what you need to do to lift the soft palate.Use less air as you move to the higher notes.Pull the sound forward to the front of your face., Though Carey does employ a breathy tone at times, she has a very clear, resonant tone most of the time.One way to develop a clear tone is to practice ""saying"" different words at certain pitches. It's easier to hear how to clarify the tone when your speaking the words, and it crosses over into singing."

Gradually sing notes higher and lower.,
Try compressed grunts.,
Use octave arpeggio exercises.,
Take vocal lessons.",How to Sing Like Mariah Carey2," Over time, you can increase your vocal range by stretching one note (or one half-note) higher and lower than what you can sing comfortably. Focus on proper breathing while singing. Keep your air supply steady so that the note doesn't crack or become airy.Don't do too much too fast, as you can hurt your voice.
Carey purportedly has a 5-octave range. While that range is impossible for most people, you can probably reach 3 octaves, especially with the help of an expert., Make a grunting noise (""uh-uh"") then switch to singing a note with the word ""mom."" This activity shortens your vocal cords, which makes it easier to hit the high notes., Arpeggios go up and then down (do-mi-sol-do-sol-mi-do, in solfege syllables, or 1-3-5-8-5-3-1, in terms of scale degrees), modulating a half step up after each arpeggio. They can help increase the top half of your range., A voice teacher can help you improve your technique, so that you can comfortably increase your range.Your voice teacher may have you do some of these same exercises. However, the benefit of having a teacher around is that he or she can hear when you're making a mistake and work to correct it. As an amateur, you may not know when you are making a mistake, and so you may let it develop into a bad habit.

Try breathing exercises.,
Hum a simple tune.,
Try scales.,
Take a short break after warming up.,
Use the same types of exercises to cool down.",How to Sing Like Mariah Carey3," Breathe in deeply so the air fills your diaphragm, and then let out all the air of your lungs, repeating several times. After a few times, add an ""S"" sound when breathing out, trying to sustain the sound as long as possible.You can also try a ""shh"" or ""fff"" sound.
In addition to increasing lung capacity over time, breathing exercises help you to relax. If your jaw and shoulders are tense, that can affect your singing. Additionally, being stressed can break your focus while singing.You can also try something simpler, such as breathing in for four counts and breathing out for four counts., Pick a song you know, and hum through it., Scales are when you go up and down the vocal range, moving up and down note by note. They prepare your voice for more complicated singing., Have a glass of water on hand, and take a few sips before moving on to your practice., Just like exercising, you need a warm up and a cool down."

However, your hips should stay directly beneath your upper body for better singing. Also, don't lean to one side or the other--keep your hips in the middle., If you lock your knees, especially during concerts, you can pass out., Tension can affect singing., Pull your arms over your head, letting your head balance between your arms. Drop your arms.Don't forget to keep your chin up, so that it is always parallel to the floor., You should feel like you have a string keeping the whole back of your body standing up straight., Instead of slumping your upper body into your lower body, lift it up to create space.

You will more naturally take to singing like her if you are very familiarized with her style. Spend some time listening to a wide variety of her music and records.Websites like YouTube and Spotify should be able to provide you with a variety of Aguilera's songs and records.
Listen to Aguilera in your free time as you're trying to develop your voice. Play her records in the background while you do things like chores. Listen to her at the gym or while you're driving somewhere in your car.;
, Aguilera's style is inspired by blues and R&B. A lot of her riffs and runs are based off classic singers in these genres. In addition to listening to Aguilera, check out artists that have inspired her style.Listen to older blues songs such as Aretha Franklin, Mavis Staples, and other classic blues singers.
Janis Joplin is also a good artist to check out if you're trying to emulate Aguilera's style.

, Part of Christina Aguilera's style is a strong emotional connection with the lyrics. This often helps her emphasize and embellish the right parts of the songs. If you want to emulate Aguilera, form an emotional connection with songs you choose to sing.Listen to songs very carefully, paying attention to each word. Ask yourself what kind of emotions the singer is conveying. Is this a happy song? A sad song?
Think about the underlying message. What is the song's story? Is about lost love, for example, or loss and grief?
It can help to read the lyrics as poetry. Look up the lyrics online and read them without a musical accompaniment. This can help you form a stronger connection with the meaning of the words.

, Record yourself singing and play it back. Then, listen to some of Aguilera's songs. Try to figure out which songs match your natural styles and talents. When emulating another singer, it's always easiest to choose from songs that will come more naturally to you. Select a few songs by Aguilera that can showcase your existing strengths as a singer., Due to her blues and R&B influence, Aguilera is famous for singing riffs, runs, and embellishments. These are notes added by the singer to a song, meant to emphasize certain emotions and lyrics. Usually, they are short patterns of two or three notes that you make using vowel sounds such as ""AA"" and ""EE.""To start learning riffs, runs, and embellishments, pay attention to where Aguilera adds them in her songs. Listen to the kinds of rhythms and sounds she makes when embellishing.
As you sing, occasionally drift from the song's regular melody to sing a few notes. You should not overdo it. Stick to two three extra notes or embellishments here and there.
Do not embellish without thought. As you sing, pay close attention to your words. Only embellish when you feel a strong, emotional connection to the lyrics you're singing.

, Embellishments are a great way to make yourself sound like Christina, as they're key to the blues genre in general. However, when not embellishing, it's okay to keep things simple. Many blues songs, the types of that inspired Christina, remain relatively simple without riffs, runs, and embellishments. Wait until such additions feel natural. When they do not feel important, simply follow the original notes and words.The more you sing, the more comfortable you will feel embellishing. You will soon be able to sense when an extra note or a word like ""baby"" will fall into the song naturally.
Embellish when you're so caught up with the song you feel the need to do so. Embellishing for its own sake will not sound natural.

, Many of Christina Aguilera's songs, as they're blues inspired, have the same words or phrases repeated again and again. It's okay to simply follow the repetitions. As long as you're singing well, people will enjoy hearing your voice and not feel bored by you repeating yourself. In ""I Am Beautiful,"" for example, a lot is repeated. Do not be afraid to repeat the words in these songs.Listen to how Aguilera handles repetition. She may change the tone or style of her voice slightly each time. This is something you could try after getting a feel for the basics.

, Christina Aguilera is known for singing with emotion. If you want to sing like her, work on feeling the emotions of the song. Some songs will be specifically relatable to you while others will be a situation you do not understand. In the latter's case, try to imagine you're going through what the singer is going through. Print out the lyrics of the song in question and really force yourself to get inside the singer's head. Try to really understand what the narrator of a song is singing before attempting to sing it yourself.When you're actually singing, try to avoid consciously thinking about the experiences and feelings in a song. This will distract you from singing. Instead, focus ion how the emotions feel. Do you feel happy, sad, scared? What physical sensations accompany these feelings?
Focusing on the raw feelings underlying a song can help you really connect with the song and give an emotional performance.

, As you work your way through learning Aguilera's songs, take it one day at a time. If you try to learn a whole song in a day, you will get frustrated. Set up a schedule for yourself and seek to master only a few bars of each song per day. Be patient and give it time. Eventually, you will be singing Aguilera's songs without struggle., You do not want to simply imitate Christina Aguilera. While you can be inspired and borrow from her style, with time you want to develop your own voice. Learn to make the songs your own and highlight your own talents.When you sing, see what people respond to best. Maybe you hit high notes particularly well, or can trigger an emotional response when singing sad songs.
Identify and develop these strengths. As you master imitating Aguilera's style, slowly drift from her influence. Add your own twist to the songs, changing the tempo, tone, or rhythm to suit your own unique talents.

, It is often difficult to gauge things like tone and pitch on your own. A professional vocal coach can help you develop your voice so you can really hit the notes correctly. If you're really dedicated to improving your singing, seek out professional voice lessons.You can look for a singer in your area online or in the local newspaper. Keep your eyes peeled for posters advertising singing lessons around town.
If you are a student, see if your school offers any courses in singing.

, You may not be able to find a singer in your area. See if you can find courses online. Some online courses are guided courses including videos that you can watch on your own time. Other courses may let you Skype in with a teacher on occasion., There are many phone apps you can download to help with your singing. They will gauge things like pitch, tempo, and tone to help you develop your voice.Look for harmonizing apps, such as Sing Harmony, which will help you learn to harmonize.
Apps such as Mode Quiz, Ear Training, and Better Ears can help you learn to better judge your own tone and pitch.

Come up with the theme for the song.,
Come up with the ""story"" of your lyrics.,
Get to know your beat.,
Write a catchy hook or chorus.",How to Write Lyrics to a Rap or Hip Hop Song1," The subject may be something that has recently happened, something that has happened in the past, an issue you are thinking about, etc. It may be a dance-type song, a song where you talk about yourself, or it may be something that happened in a dream. There are no wrong themes, as long as they come from personal experience somehow.


The title of the song is a good indicator of its theme. However, you can always come up with the title later.;
, You don't have to tell an actual story, though story-raps have been popular since the birth of hip-hop (Immortal Technique's ""Dance with the Devil,"" most Ghostface Killah songs). Telling a story just means your song or verse has a beginning, middle, and end. You want to take the listener on a journey, even if it is just a journey about how great and steezy you are.


Some rappers write out their songs as paragraphs first, then write the songs and rhymes to follow the general structure.
Having a structure to your song helps you build a coherent idea out. For example, your best point of biggest rhyme wouldn't come at the very beginning of a song, it would come near the end, like the climax of a good movie. This will help you engage and hold listeners.At the very least, try and end your song on a different place than where you started. This is why even ""material rap"" about gold and girls often starts by mentioning how little the rapper had when they first started working.

, Make sure that the beat you choose is one you're comfortable with. For example, if you can't rap very fast, you may not want to choose a fast beat, as you won't be able to rap over it without losing your breath or stuttering. Listen to the beat 4-5 times to get comfortable with the rhythm and the mood of the song. Get a feel for the speed and energy of the song as well as the mood.


Uptempo songs (Das Racist, ""People are Strange"") usually require fast verses with lots of words, while slower beats (50 Cent, ""P.I.M.P."") usually have laid back verses. This rule is not hard and fast, however (see Twista on ""Slow Jamz,"" for example).
When lyrics matches the beat, great songs are born. Think about how the beat makes you feel-- is it tense and atmospheric, like Jay-Z's ""Renegade,"" or is it upbeat and celebratory, like Kanye's ""The Glory?"" Notice how the lyrics in these songs match the beat.
Listen again to A$AP Rocky's ""One Train,"" where five unique rappers have verses over the same beat. Note how each one approaches the song differently: some urgent (Kendrick), some joyful (Danny Brown), some angry (Yelawolf), some contemplative (Big K.R.I.T.). All of them, however, fit into the beat.
You do not need to have a beat to start writing raps. It can help to write your lyrics without a beat in mind, then save them until the right beat comes along.

, This is the repeated phrase in the middle of the song, separating each verse. They are not strictly necessary (see A$AP Rocky's ""One Train""), but almost any rap song that wants to gain radio play or traction needs a good catchy hook. It can range from something very deep to something that's just catchy, and it almost always reinforces the theme of the song. Many hooks are sung, not rapped.


50 Cent is a master hook writer, and songs like ""P.I.M.P."" and ""In Da Club"" have hooks that are still sung over 10 years later.
For an easy, classic hook, try coming up with 1-2 separate, simple, rhyming phrases. Repeat them each twice, back to back, for the ""classic"" chorus. Like this catchy hook, repeated in its entirety twice:

Cigarettes on cigarettes my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies all my homies think it's dank

I miss my cocoa butter kisses... cocoa butter kisses.-- Chance the Rapper, ""Cocoa Butter Kisses""

Figure out how many bars you have to rap on.,
Understand rhyme inside and out.,
Write ""punchline raps"" in reverse.,
Organize your lines into a rhyme scheme.,
Make sure your song is personal and real.",How to Write Lyrics to a Rap or Hip Hop Song2," A bar is simply one line of your song. Most raps are built out of 16 or 32 bar verses though they can be as short as 8 or 12 bars as well. If you're writing the whole song yourself you might have 2-3 verses and a hook. You might also have a short 8-10 bar bridge, which is a short verse with a slightly different beat or structure.You can write your rap without knowing the bars as well. Simply write until you feel like your verse is finished, then edit the beat to fit the desired length.

, Raps are written around rhymes. Rhyme connects to lines so that they flow smoothly together, pulling the listener through the song. While all lines of your rap don't need to rhyme, and probably should not, you need to have a firm grasp of rhyme techniques to become a rapper. Luckily, this doesn't require any studying, just an ear for what sounds good to you. Still, it can help to know the different types of rhyme common in rap:



Simple Rhyme: When the last syllables of two lines rhyme, like ""Can"" and ""man."" This is the most common and basic form of rhyme.

Multi-syllabic rhyme: One of the best ways to show your lyrical skills is to rhyme multiple syllables at once. This can stretch across multiple words as well, such as Big Daddy Kane in ""One Day:"" ""Ain’t no need for wondering who’s the man/ Staying looking right always an exclusive brand.""

Slant Rhyme: Rhyming too closely related, but technically non-rhyming, words. Usually, they have a common vowel sound. This is incredibly common in rap, because how you say/sing the words can make them sound much more similar. Examples include ""Nose"" and ""go,"" or ""orange"" and ""porridge.""Internal Rhyme (In-Rhyme): Rhyming words that do not come at the end of a line but in the middle of it. For example, Madvillains' ""Rhinestone Cowboy:"" ""Made of fine chrome alloy / find him on the grind he's a rhinestone cowboy."", Punchlines are the big lines, jokes, or rhymes that elevate the song from good to great. There are thousands of great examples, but they are mostly a matter of personal preference. To write them, try to think of the punchline first then build the rhyming lines around it.


If your punchline is ""I'm stepping over competition, so expect to be trampled,"" you might try to write a line leading into it that ends with a word rhyming with ""trampled."" For example, ""They see me in the booth so they know they should scramble/ I'm steppin' over competition so expect to be trampled"").

, A rhyme scheme is simply how the song is structured. The most common way to do this is with alternating couplets, which are two lines that rhyme at the end. The next two lines also rhyme at the end, but with a different set of words. That said, there are many, many ways to write out rhyme schemes, such as alternating (the first line rhymes with the third, and the second with the fourth), or rhyming 4-6 lines with the same word (like the beginning of ""Get 'Em High""). The best way to learn is practice.


If you're a rapper that raps with a lot of flow (smooth, quick words) you may want to have every bar end with the same amount of syllables or almost the same amount of syllables.
If you're a rapper that raps fast you may want to have lots of internal rhymes in every bar, like "" the industry's gettin' clean and I've seen what them haters mean/ if you thought I was lettin' up setting up the terrain was dreamed"".
If you're a story rapper you can have the first verse be your intro, your second verse your problem, and your last verse your conclusion. To match this, you might play with a different rhyme scheme in every verse to show growth or use a similar one to indicate that there is no growth.

, Make sure you mean every word and every word comes from your soul. Let the music come to you. To start writing good lyrics, you should throw on a beat that juices your brain start thinking of some insane rhymes. It's all about the state of mind.


Specifics from real life will always make a better song. The reason Nas' Illmatic is one of the all-time great albums is because it feels lived in, not made up.
If you don't have a theme or rhyme scheme yet, just start writing lines that you like. Eventually, these lines will come together to tell a full song, and this can be a great way to practice rhymes.
The best rappers are able to tell stories from real life, connecting to their audience's memories and emotions. They are successful not because they tell crazy or unbelievable stories, but because they make a simple story connect with practice and well-written rhymes.

Practice rewriting your favorite raps.,
Learn poetic techniques to up your game.,
Use specific imagery in your lyrics.,
Work on the flow, or delivery, of your lines so that they work together to tell your story.,
Read the great rappers for inspiration.",How to Write Lyrics to a Rap or Hip Hop Song3," This is one of the best ways to learn rapping technique. Take your favorite songs and learn them forwards and backward. Then rewrite the rap, using the same rhyme scheme but with your own verses. This is how mixtapes first became popular, with rappers like Curren$y and 50 Cent taking popular songs, flipping them, and making them their own. Even if you never share the song, this is a great way to learn rap techniques naturally., Rap is poetry -- using words, sounds, and rhymes to create beautiful art and ideas. As such, it is no surprise that the best rappers have taken inspiration from the best poets. Eminem, for example, famously used Shakespearean meter and rhyme in many of his famous songs. Other examples include:



Alliteration/Assonance: Words with similar sounds that are placed close together, like ""Two tip-top teachers"" or ""apple attitudes."" Listen to Joey Bada$$'s ""Waves"" for a great example.

Simile/Metaphor: Closely connected, this is when writers compare two objects that aren't usually alike to make a point. For example -- ""I put the metal to his chest like Robocop"" works on multiple levels, bullets are made of metal, Robocop's chest is covered in metal armor, and the biggest target when shooting someone is their chest. This is a much more poetic way to imply ""I might shoot him.""Refrain: A line that is repeated at various points for emphasis. The more you hear the line, the more it changes, evolves, and gains power. For a master class in how to use a refrain, see Kendrick Lamar's ""The Blacker the Berry.""

Anaphora: When the first half of a line repeats, but the rest of the line changes, like in Eminem's ""If I Had"" where ever line begins with ""Tired of...."" This is a great way to show how difficult, constant, or trying something may be, or overwhelm the listener intentionally., Great imagery puts visuals behind the listeners' eyes, engaging multiple senses to create complex, engaging raps. The best rappers all conjure images up in your mind, telling stories and making their lyrics come alive. To do this, focus on being specific-- use adjectives and adverbs to make the images your own.


This doesn't have to be purely visual imagery. Action Bronson uses foods and scents in his raps to give them an entirely new dimension.
The kings of imagery, Andre 3000, Ghostface Killah, Eminem, etc. are often those rappers that gain the greatest followings.

, Good lines become great lines with good flow. Flow is how you deliver the words in relation to the beat. Are you slow, holding back, or are you attacking the beat with speed and intensity. Do you waver up and down, picking up and slowing down depending on the line? Flow takes practice and patience, so put a beat on and practice.


You don't have to have the same flow throughout the whole song. Nas's incredibly ""NY State of Mind"" flows like a great jazz solo -- stopping, starting, pausing and pushing forward around the incredible rhymes., Much like a burgeoning writer needs to study the best poets, a growing rapper needs to read to the best. Reading a rap lets you see it on the page, much like the rapper when they wrote the lyrics. This will help you comprehend rhyme schemes and little tricks. Sites like RapGenius, for example, even have annotated lyrics that explain metaphors, rhymes, and references. Listen to what you enjoy, but a small selection of essential verses (in addition to the other songs referenced in the article) to start with includes:


AZ's, first verse on ""Life's a B---"", off of Nas's album Illmatic.

Notorious B.I.G, ""Notorious Thugs.""
Black Thought, ""75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction).
Rakim on ""As the Rhyme Goes On,"" on Paid in Full.

Kendrick Lamar, ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst.""
Lupe Fiasco, ""Murals.""
Eminem, ""Lose Yourself.""

Increase surprise with slant rhyme.",How to Write a Rap Punchline," Generally, a punchline is considered to be either a single line or a couplet.A couplet is a set of two lines that work together to convey your message. These two lines often rhyme.Punchlines give weight and impact to your rap. Good punchlines can be difficult to think up on the fly, which is why many rappers base entire songs around a killer, pre-thought punchline.


Buildup punchlines reveal a connection or add meaning to a previous statement in your rap to create surprise, anger, or amusement in your audience.

Eminem gives a great example of this in “Nail in the Coffin,” where he says, “But then again you’ll finally get your wish, / Cuz you’ll be all over the street like 50 cent.”


One-liners are usually clever and to the point. Like:

High class like a senior in secondary.
You couldn't make fans cheer if you were the leading genius in the wild rap frontier.;
, The more rap you’re exposed to, the easier it will be for your mind to pick up on patterns and techniques in it. Practice this by using the same structure as rappers you admire and swapping in your own words.For example,

Chino XL in “Creep,” says: “As far as that album you dropped, I ain’t feelin’ it / I wouldn’t buy your record if it had a hundred-dollar bill in it.”You might imitate Chino by saying something like, “As far as your skills, I’ll admit, they’re polished / But rhymes don’t have to sparkle to leave fools demolished.”


Some prominent punchline rappers you might want to study include Biggie, Big L, Lloyd Banks, Nas, Eminem, Jay-Z, and more.

, Spend time building up a stockpile of punchlines. Choose topics that are timeless, like falling in love and hard times, or ones useful in many different situations, like those that mock popular figures in society or depict common experiences. You might poke fun at a specific person, bring up a topical point in news, or utilize a well-known proverb in your punchline. Some examples follow:To create a punchline from a proverb, you might say, “Two wrongs may not make a right / But it ain't always wrong to fight.”
A punchline that uses a timeless theme like love might look something like, “It’s true that only fools fall in love, / But for what it’s cost me, it’s an emotion I’d get rid of.”
Using common experiences in punchlines might look like, “Elevator muzak is a practical symphony, / Compared to your rappin’, this audio villainy.”

, When rapping freestyle especially, use your surroundings, like the weather, in your punchlines. Include regional changes that effect the world at large, like droughts, pollution, disasters, and so on, in your punchline content. The serious nature of these topics will add weight to your punchlines.A punchline that uses a natural disaster might say, “My words rush at ya like a Japanese tsunami / Your rhymes sound more like you're callin’ for mommy.”
Punchline about the local climate, like in the example, “Though I spit rhymes on stage cool, precise, and clear, / Is the AC here broke? It's hot up in here.”
If you noticed someone tapping their fingers to a beat, it might inspire the line, “I seen you dancin' your fingers on the edge of the table / Could just be nerves, but I think you're unstable.”

, Your ability to speak clearly and without getting tongue tied is critical to the delivery of your punchline. Warm up your voice before rapping so you don’t become hoarse or strain your voice. Practice diction. Gently massage the muscles of your face to release tension.Nervousness very frequently makes artists rush when performing. This can result in your rap being too fast to be clear. Massage your face and neck lightly by rubbing them with your hands in small circles to help release tension.

Tongue twisters can be a valuable resource for warming up your mouth before rapping. Do a few of these before you go on stage.Try to speak clearly while you have several ice cubes in your mouth. This is an old technique for training greater precision in speaking.
Change up the delivery of set lines you plan on using to prevent your speaking from becoming robotic or wooden. Try varying speed, volume, and stress., You can increase the sense of anticipation in your audience by inserting lines between the setup of your punchline and the payoff line. The setup is a line that may be unclear or differently interpreted, but changes when the payoff line drops. To expand on a previous example, Eminem displays this technique in “Nail in the Coffin”:


“I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino / An 83-year-old fake Pachino / So how can he hold me over some balcony / Without throwin’ out his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me / Please don’t, you’ll probably fall with me / And our will both be history / But then again you’ll finally get your wish / Cause you’ll be all over the street like 50 Cent.”, One-liners work well when their parts have multiple meanings. A good example of this can be found in Childish Gambino’s EP, “Be Alone,” where he says, “Set the game ablaze, I’m an arcade fire.” Not only does this paint a visual image of an artist on a hot streak, it also pokes fun at how critics have pigeonholed him as a white-audience-friendly independent artist.Lil Wayne had a particularly impressive one-liner in the song “6 Foot 7 Foot,” where he said, “Real G’s move in silence like lasagna.”
In “Just a Memory,” Notorious B.I.G. utters the memorable one-liner, “Climb the ladder to success escalator style.
Big Daddy Kane throws down the gauntlet in “’Cause I Can Do it Right” with, “I won’t say I’m the baddest, or portray that role, but I’m in the Top Two, and my father’s gettin’ old.”, Choose a phrase that embodies the topic of your couplet. For example, “I’m going to embarrass you.” Adjust that phrase to fit your personal style, tone, delivery, and the beat you’re rapping to (if any). Something like, “Foo’, in front of y’all here I’ll thoroughly embarrass.” Then create a complementary second line that rhymes, as in:


Foo’, in front of y’all here I’ll thoroughly embarrass / Yo’ like a whoppin’ by your ma on the terrace.”, Delivery isn’t only about the words that you speak. In many cases, a small pause can add tension or create a more dramatic effect. Pauses can punch up comedic aspects of your rap. Depending on style, some rappers utilize pauses more than others.Add pauses between revealing moments in your rap, like where the setup begins to transition to the payoff. The shift in meaning created by the payoff will be highlighted by the pause preceding it.
Stressing certain words can create interesting sound patterns in language. This can result in ordinary things sounding weightier and deeper than they might otherwise.

, A pun is a line that suggests two or more meanings to humorous effect. Puns can also create humor by confusing similar sounding words that have different meanings.You might even take a common pun and use it to create one more faithful to your own style.


Lil Wayne puns the line, “Don’t up with Wayne / ’Cause when it Waynes it pours.”
Childish Gambino evokes the suave image of the actor and his role in the movie The Fly with his Goldblum pun: “More green than my Whole Foods and I’m too fly, Jeff Goldblum.”, A metaphor compares two things that are unalike except for certain common characteristic(s).These uncommon comparisons can make situations dramatic, comedic, or absurd. Some examples of metaphor include:


”She was the nastiest hornet to sting my heart / Lucky me, when I met ya’, I bought an EpiPen dart.”
”His momma wasn’t cucumber cool, she was iceberg lettuce cold.”
“My words are leopards / They quick, they real, and on stage, they got spots on ’em.”

, Irony is where the actual meaning of words is something other than what was intended. A good way to simplify this in your mind is by thinking of irony as things going the opposite of what you’d expect.For example, it would be ironic if it were true that the biggest dog in the world was named Tiny.


Irony in your rap could might look something like, “I roll real big / Every time I ride a Ferris wheel.”
The following is an example of irony with a little buildup: ”You might feel like a million dollar / But you are what you eat, / And Imma make you eat .”

, Slant rhyme is also sometimes called an imperfect rhyme, a near rhyme, or an oblique rhyme. This is where words sound close enough that the rhyme scheme is uninterrupted, even though the words don't rhyme perfectly.In some cases these rhymes are formed with multiple words (referred to as ""multis"").


Some words don’t rhyme as easily as others, like orange. However, with a slant multi, you can rhyme “orange” with “door hinge.”

Use your body to sing.,
Don’t push your voice.,
Sing in-tune.,
Use an instant vocal fix.,
Get natural vibrato.,
Understand what makes your voice type.,
Understand that you will not be able to perfectly emulate Ariana's voice.,
Find your tune.,
Improve your high notes.,
Add the mechanics of a yawn.,
Sing in falsetto.",How to Sing Like Ariana Grande," If you feel your singing voice is awful, it is likely because you’re not using specific parts of your body correctly. To use your body, keep your mouth slack and exhale gently. Keep your mouth flexible and loose. When practicing, use an “Ahh-ah” sound. The first “Ahh” should be slightly higher in pitch and tone than the second.Sing from your diaphragm to project.;
, When you push your voice forcefully or strain it, your body will tighten up. This will in turn strain your throat muscles and you will lose much of your tone and air supply. If your voice is being pushed, it will sound out of tune or it will crack and break., Several singers struggle with proper tune and pitch. One way to perfect your pitch and tune is to play notes on the piano and imitate them with your voice., If you’re really struggling with your voice, try this vocal fix. Watch your jaw move as you say “A-E-I-O-U”. Determine what vowels your jaw closes on. It is likely the vowels E and U. Try again, taking care to keep your jaw propped open. Practice singing while keeping your jaw equally open. This may take a lot of practice to perfect but will eventually become natural. Having your mouth open equally on all sounds will help keep a uniform and even voice.If you’re struggling to keep your jaw wide, wedge your fingers or a piece of cork in your mouth and try again. Practice until you no longer need the wedge to keep your mouth open., Vibrato is the way to change pitch in your voice. It allows your singing to be breathy and charismatic. Knowing how to control your vibrato is a good thing, as some contemporary singers, like Ariana, have a small amount of vibrato so having the control is important.Practice vibrato techniques. For example, stand in front of a mirror. Press on your chest with your hands then raise your chest up. Breathe in and exhale, while holding your chest steady. Sing a note and hold it as long as possible without moving your chest. Halfway through, press down with your hands but keep your chest raised to meet the pressure. Relax the back of your neck and keep your jaw open wide as you belt out the note. Imagine the air in your mouth swirling while tucking your chin slightly and keeping your chest raised., There are a number of variables that make up the type of voice you have. The variables that create your singing voice include range, weight, tessitura, timbre, transition points, vocal registers, speech level, and your physical characteristics.Range is determined by the notes that your body is able to produce.Weight refers to whether your voice is light and agile or heavy, rich, and powerful.Tessitura are the notes, or part of your range, that you are most comfortable singing.Timber is what makes your voice unique in terms of quality and texture. Some people may have a more gravelly voice while Ariana does not.Transition points are where you transition from singing from your chest register, to middle, and to your head.Vocal register refers to how long you can extend your notes.Speech level is the range of your speaking voice.Physical characteristics play into your singing voice as some people may have larger lungs and stronger vocal cords., Everyone has their own singing voice because of a number of factors so it is extremely rare to be able to reproduce someone else's voice 100%. Do not be discouraged if you do not sound exactly like Ariana. First, refine your vocal talents then you can emulate her stage presence and performance style.

, Ariana is a falsetto singer, which means she sings softly when hitting high notes. This isn’t practical for every singer, but once you find your own vocal range you can sing in tune. Singing in tune is half the battle and will make your voice sound significantly better. Once you’ve found your tune, you can try pairing your voice to Ariana’s music.If you’re struggling to sing in tune, pair up with a piano. Playing basic keys on the piano will allow you to check if your voice is matching the tune of the piano correctly., When singing high notes, think “down”. This means, if you sing high notes imagine your voice has resistance and weight. In contrast, if you were singing a low note, your voice would be light and airy.Add weight to your belly to keep your voice resisted.


Imagine an elevator as your voice. Imagine how as the elevator rises, the counter weight must go down to get the elevator to its height., Imagine a yawn and your soft palate. Your soft palate is located at the back of the roof of your mouth. When your mouth opens to yawn, your soft palate raises. This allows you to project your voice, and sometimes, increase the tune of your vocal range., Falsetto singing, used by Ariana, will add character and depth to your voice. Falsetto is meant to be mostly high pitched, in a soft, quiet voice. Imagine a 3 or 4 year old child singing and try to emulate that with the voice you are projecting.To practice falsetto, sing to the tune of a siren or ambulance. Releasing an “ahhhh” sound to the highest note you can reach without cracking, and coming back down is a great way to practice.Another great way to practice is with the vowels “e” and “o”. These vowel pronunciations are perfect for the soft, child-like singsong voice. Sing them from low to high pitches."

, As you add to your vocabulary, try reading certain passages out loud and noticing where you naturally tend to add emphasis. In English, for example, a lot of poetry and song lyrics are written in iambic pentameter, in which the first syllable is unstressed, the second is stressed, the third is unstressed, and so on for a total of five stressed syllables and five unstressed syllables. Developing your sense of meter will ultimately help you form a beat to your lyrics, or the lyrics to your beat, in a way that sounds reflexive and easy.


Try saying ""rapper"" both ways, with the first syllable stressed and the second unstressed, then vice versa. Notice the difference?
It might sound dorky, but a good way to introduce yourself to iambic pentameter is to read Shakespeare aloud. (Search for his plays online.) You'll begin to notice the alternating stressed syllables and how naturally they flow.

, Your lyrics should have an objective other than making words rhyme. The rhyme is the glue for your lyrics, but the substance is in your message. What do you want to say? When you're talking to other people, which topics really get you fired up?


Whatever you choose, be real - rapping about your own life gives the song credibility.

, Rap lyrics can happen anywhere - at home, at work, at school, on the toilet, and in your sleep. Write down what comes to you without censoring yourself or editing. When you're struggling with writer's block later, refer back to your ideas.

, A hook is the part of a song that gets stuck in your head and makes you want to listen to it again. For most raps, this makes up the chorus. It doesn't have to be long, but it should have a catchy rhythm and be fun to hum.


For a lot of songwriters, the hook is the most difficult part to create. Don't feel discouraged if it takes you awhile to come up with one - it's better to wait for a good hook than to wrap up your song with a bad one.

, After you have worked out a final draft of your rap lyrics, memorize every word. When you go to perform your rap song in the studio you don't want to be reading from your notebook.

, It is a freeware that is user-friendly and works quite well. If you own a Mac, you can record using Garage Band, which is already installed. After you gain more experience, it is recommended that you move onto other software such as Audio Audition. They are not free, but they are better than the free ones.

, Pick a beat that you want to use to rap on. You can search for rap beats on youtube, or download rap beats from a beat distributor. A good strategy here is to already have the core of your rhymes written, and just work on adapting them to fit your beat. A common pitfall is if you try to write the core of your lyrics to a beat, you can likely suffer from ""writers block"" because you are trying to be creative and do revisions at the same time.

, Using your mic and your audio editing software, you can now begin recording. Load your downloaded beat to the software and record over it. Remember to add emotion or you will sound like a robot metaphorically speaking!

, While this is time-consuming, it gives you a wider variety of takes to choose from. Record at least 1 to 3 more times. This is because your first time might not be perfect.

, Tell yourself that you can do anything and that you sound brilliant. If you don't believe in yourself, then why should anyone else?

, Take voice lessons and exercise your voice. Your instructor can also give you a more objective view of your capabilities, and tell you whether professional singing could be an option for you.

, Don't try to hold your voice. Show your talent to the people and sing out loud.

, When you are singing with other people, you can take charge of the melody of the song while the rest do the blending or backup.

, Make sure you get your voice from your diaphragm and not from your throat. ]! in through the nose and slowly out through the mouth.

, Especially with pronouncing vowels, you have to open your mouth wide. Try fitting your three fingers. If you feel like you're practically smiling when you sing, you might sound kind of nasally.

, Stand as you normally would, and relax your shoulders. If your shoulders are tense, it's more difficult to breathe correctly. Take a deep breath or two and slightly loosen or relax your stance from the initial pose. Keep one leg slightly back from the other and knee slightly bent Don't lock your knees.

, It seems odd, but sometimes singers need help remembering to breathe, or they'll run out of breath. If they remind you to breathe in between each phrase, you won't run out.

, We all know practice makes perfect (or as close to perfect as we'll get). If you keep singing the same songs over and over again experimenting with dynamics, you'll sound great. Little things like that make a huge difference in your overall performance.

To identify your vocal comfort zone without assistance, start by singing a simple “ah” at speaking tone. Listen to the note until you have the sound memorized—or record it, if necessary. Identify that note by singing it into a digital tuner or by comparing it to the notes played on a pitch pipe.
Starting at your speaking tone note, try singing through the musical scale (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do). If your voice strains or you fall out of tune while singing the scale, determine where it happens.
Starting at your speaking tone note, sing through the same musical scale backwards. Determine where your voice strains or where you fall out of tune.
The pitch you sing in and the notes you sing without strain make up your vocal comfort zone.;
, Instead of jumping directly into an actual song, work on matching individual notes and pitches.


The easiest note for most people will be their speaking tone note, so that's usually a good place to start. You'll eventually progress throughout all notes within your comfort zone, though.
Go through this entire practice without any noisy, external distractions. You need to focus and hear clearly throughout the entire process, and doing so will be much easier if your surrounding environment remains quiet.

, Listen to the note out loud, repeating it as often as needed until you can hold it in your mind. Once you feel familiar with the note, replay it in your mind.


Play the note on a pitch pipe, piano, guitar, or other instrument. Concentrate on the vibration it makes within your ear.
Many people have difficulty processing vocal notes after hearing instrumental notes, so if necessary, find a recording of someone singing that individual note. Listen to the vocal recording of that note and memorize the way it sounds.

, Sing the note aloud and record yourself while doing it. Play the recording back and compare your results with the actual note. Continuing practicing in this manner until you can sing the correct note.Sing loud enough to actually hear yourself. It can be embarrassing to sing loudly while you're still out of tune, but if you aren't able to actively hear yourself, you won't be able to evaluate your progress and correct yourself accordingly.
Relax and sing the note without restraint. You may hit it correctly the first time you aim for it, but don't be discouraged if that doesn't happen. Listen to the recording to determine whether you need to sing higher or lower. Make the adjustment, then try again.
Once you do hit the right note, practice singing it several times until you can hit the note directly and without needing to build or ease into it.

, If you need a little extra help, try practicing your chosen note using a digital tuner. The tuner will show you which note you're singing as you sing it, which makes it easier to adjust your singing voice in real time.Turn on the tuner and set it to your target note. Ideally, you should also set it within your natural pitch range, but many tuners will still work even if you inadvertently sing in a different octave.
The tuner will play the note as a simple, ongoing tone. Listen to the note and try matching it in your head, then sing the note aloud.
As you sing, the tuner screen will show if you're singing too high or too low. Adjust your pitch accordingly based on the these readings until the tuner indicates that you have hit the correct note.
After hitting the correct note, repeat it and hold it as needed to imprint the way it sounds in your mind.

, Once you feel comfortable with the first note you chose, repeat the same process with another note that falls within your comfort zone. Do this multiple times until you complete at least one full octave.


Be patient as you practice and don't rush through any of the notes.
Periodically return to notes you practiced earlier. Verify that you can still hit those notes even after practicing others.

, When you feel comfortable with your ability to stay in tune on individual notes, practice stringing different notes together and singing the sequence. Try hitting each note directly, rather than gliding your voice between points.


Work slowly. Begin by stringing two notes together and switching back and forth between them. Gradually introduce more into the sequence as you become comfortable making the switches.
Continue evaluating your progress by recording your practices or using a digital tuner.

, When choosing your practice song, try to pick one that fits your comfort zone. You can also drop or raise the octave of another song so that it matches your vocal range more naturally.


For example, many songs meant for male voices are set to a key of G or A, but for those who have trouble staying in tune, dropping the key by half an octave (to C or D) may help.Similarly, many songs meant for female voices are set to a key of C or D, but for those who struggle, raising the key to E or F could improve the experience. For women with deeper voices, however, dropping the key to G or A might be better.
If all else fails, just play around with different songs until you find one that fits. Listen to songs in multiple pitch ranges and try humming along, then pick a song you can hum to without straining your voice much.

, Listen as another singer practices the song. Try to replay each note in your mind immediately after it leaves the singer's mouth.


You can listen to a live singer or to a recording; either option should suffice. Either way, try listening to a singer who sticks straight to the melody line. It might sound great when an experienced singer plays around with the melody, but for instructional purposes, you need to listen to someone who keeps the song as simple as possible.
If you're listening to a recording and are unable to synchronize the tune inside your head, consider playing the song multiple times before moving into the next step.

, As you listen to the song, read the sheet music, or read the lyrics, identify every written pause and every unmarked opportunity for a natural pause. Note the placement of these pauses and remember them while singing.You must be able to strongly sing each phrase through to its end. If your breath weakens, your pitch will also weaken, and you'll fall out of tune.
Try following the lyrics instead of the music. Read the lyrics aloud without singing them. As a general rule, any place you pause while speaking the words should be a place where you take a short breath while singing.
You should avoid breathing in the middle of a word or thought.

, Play the song again and try singing along with the other singer. If you fall out of tune while you sing, try to correct yourself mid-song instead of stopping and starting over.


If you remain out of key after several lines, however, stop yourself and return to the spot you faltered. Focus on getting your pitch perfect at that point. After correcting your mistake, start from the beginning and sing the song through.
Continue until you are able to sing the song through and remain in tune throughout the entire thing.

, Once you feel comfortable with your ability to stay in tune while singing along, practice singing the song without the accompaniment of another singer.


If possible, sing along to an instrumental version of that song instead of trying to sing a cappella. It'll be much easier to remain in tune with the music guiding you.
Continue practicing as much as needed until you can confidently sing through the song without many any errors.

, After tuning your voice within one song, practice singing other songs that fit within your vocal comfort zone. You can gradually ease yourself beyond your comfort zone, as well, but only after you learn to consistently stay in tune while singing within your zone.


Understand that some keys are completely outside of your vocal range, so even if you can sing in tune, you won't be able to sing along with songs set to those keys.
Enjoy the process. The first few songs you pick might be simple and uninteresting, but as you improve, start progressing into songs you actively enjoy to make the experience more satisfying.

, It's possible to start singing in tune without any assistance, but enlisting the help of someone with a good singing voice or a good ear for music will usually make the process easier.


Someone with a thorough understanding of pitches and keys will usually be able to offer more exact advice, but as long as someone has a fairly decent ear for music, he or she can listen to you, evaluate your progress, and make general suggestions.
If you know someone who sings well and within your vocal range, consider asking him or her to sing along with you. You can match your voice to that person's to help yourself tune it.

, If you need extra help, consider taking formal singing classes at a community college or similar venue.


Similarly, you could also take classes with private singing tutors or coaches. This option is more private than an open class, but it can also be more expensive.

Practice with objects similar to a microphone.,
Hold the microphone at a 45-degree angle.The rounded head of the microphone will be next to your mouth.,
Keep your elbow in towards your body.This is the elbow of the arm holding the microphone.,
Use a microphone stand.,
Position the microphone close to your mouth.Vocal microphones are designed for close use.,
Keep your head steady.,
Maintain your posture.Your posture is an integral part of your sound when you are singing.,
Test your microphone.Whether you are recording or performing, you want to test your microphone before you begin and become familiar with it.,
Don’t over or under compensate in volume.",How to Sing Into a Microphone," Even if you don’t always have access to a microphone during your solo practice time, you will still get the feel for singing with an object in your hand.


You can use something like a hairbrush or water bottle to simulate the feeling of holding the microphone while you are singing.Microphones are fairly heavy, so use an object with some weight. For example, if you are using a water bottle for practice, use a full water bottle rather than an empty one.;
,


Grasp the microphone firmly with all the fingers of the hand of your choice. If you want, you can support the microphone with both hands or switch between hands. Your grip should be firm but not overly tight.
Don’t grasp any part of the head of the microphone, as this can muffle the sound. Your hand should be around the middle of the microphone.

, Keeping it close helps to anchor your microphone and keep the sound steady. .


However, don’t hold it so tightly close to you that it restricts your airflow or rib cage expansion while singing.

, If you aren’t comfortable holding a microphone, you can ask to use a microphone stand. This keeps your arms free and can help ease your nerves.


In certain settings, like a recording studio, your microphone will most likely always be on a stand, so you won’t need to worry about holding it.

, However, you don’t want to touch the microphone with your mouth.


Optimally, your mouth should be about one to four inches from the center, or axis, of the head of the microphone.
If you are using a stand, make sure the stand is raised so that the head of the microphone is at the level of your mouth when you are standing up straight. The top of the microphone's head should be directly across from your lower lip.You don't want to have to either raise or lower your chin to sing into the microphone.

, Because you want your mouth to be pointed towards the center of the microphone, your tone can change if you move your head around too much.


When you move your head during a performance, make sure that you move your microphone along with your head.
Alternately, try to keep your head held steady above the microphone.

, You want to make sure that your microphone placement allows you to keep your good posture in place.


Your back and neck should be comfortably straight.
You don’t want to hunch over your microphone. You also don’t want to have to lift up your chin to sing into your microphone.

,


Know how to turn your microphone on. It may seem silly, but you want to make sure you are comfortable with the basics of the specific microphone you are using.
As you sound check, don’t just say a few words. Sing a portion of your songs, trying to test a range of notes and levels. You want the sound tech to adjust the microphone to your specific voice and tone, rather than you trying to adjust to the microphone.
Make sure you can hear yourself, whether you’re listening in the speakers or have a headset. If you can’t hear what you are singing, ask the sound tech to adjust your microphone or headset.
Make sure the sound is clear. Listen for any unwanted feedback. This can be an indication the levels need to be adjusted.

, You want to sing at your natural level, neither too softly or too loudly.


Resist the temptation to adjust your distance from the microphone when you sing at different volumes or pitches.
The microphone should be adjusted to you. You want to sing at a normal volume.
Don’t feel like you have to hold back on big crescendos just because you’re singing into a microphone.
When you’re going through sound check, make sure you are singing at the level you’ll be singing during your performance.

Make your voice sound indistinct and far away.One of the key elements of shoegaze music is the importance placed on atmosphere.,
Sing softly and in a melancholic way.Another way to create get that “far away” sound is to sing very softly.,
Work on a falsetto.,
Create melodies with your voice.,
Write poetic or experimental lyrics.,
Harmonize with another vocalist.Shoegaze often makes use of two vocalists rotating and harmonizing.,
Sing made-up words.,
Find inspirational shoegaze bands.,
Bury the vocals in the mix.,
Run the vocals through reverb and delay effects pedals.,
Record vocals a decibel or two quieter than you usually would.This is another simple trick shoegaze musicians use in the studio to get the far away vocal sound they want.",How to Sing in Shoegaze Style," For the singer, that means delivering dreamy sounding vocals that swirl and echo behind fuzzy, distorted guitars. When you’re singing, allow the words to flow. Don't concern yourself with pronouncing each word clearly.When practicing shoegaze-style vocals, avoid enunciating syllables to create an indistinct and far away sound.
Try standing across the room from a microphone, rather than right in front of it, and record yourself singing. Play the recordings back to hear ways you can change your singing style.;
, The mood of shoegaze is often sad. The soft vocals help to create a lonely, out-of-focus vibe. Before you start singing, spend a few minutes getting yourself in the right mood.


Go somewhere quiet and focus on creating a moody atmosphere.
It might help to set the mood by turning down the lights and lighting a few candles.

, Not all shoegaze vocalists have high-pitched voices, but they are definitely a common characteristic in the genre. Start by working on a very soft falsetto. Then blend it in with the melody and harmony of the song. If singing an entire track in a falsetto sounds daunting, try to work it only into the chorus.


A common characteristic of shoegaze songs is lower-pitched verses that escalate into ecstatic, high-pitched choruses.

, Unlike in pop music, which puts emphasis on vocals and lyrics, shoegaze music prefers to bury the vocals behind distortion and reverb. Instead of focusing on the words you’re singing, try using your voice like an instrument.When you’re practicing, try humming or using soft “la la” sounds to create vocal melodies.


Instead of singing to be heard over the guitar, let your voice blend into and around the guitar melodies.
This will help to create the layered texture of the shoegaze sound.

, The hazy, spaced-out vibe of shoegaze works best with lyrics that are dream-like. Instead of writing songs that tell stories, work on creating an emotion or mood with your lyrics. Since shoegaze doesn’t emphasize vocals, don’t worry about being clear or coherent when you sing.Use a more poetic approach that fits the mood of the song.
Make sure you’re singing the dreamy words in a soft tone of voice. This creates the ethereal sound shoegaze is known for.

, This technique creates a dream-like atmosphere. The harmonizing vocals can be processed through an effects pedal to give them an ethereal, reverberating quality.

, Many shoegaze bands have used this technique. Elizabeth Fraser, the vocalist for the band Cocteau Twins, wrote most of her lyrics with made-up words so that she could concentrate on her vocal melodies. Through this “language” she effectively communicated moods, themes, melodies and atmospheres without using coherent spoken language.You don’t have to use this technique for your songs, but try it out when you’re practicing vocals.
Use it as a vocal exercise to help you stop focusing on lyrical content.

, This genre has a very specific style, but there is still a lot of variety among the bands. Spend some time investigating these bands for vocal inspiration. There are many different vocal techniques used to achieve the dream-like shoegaze sound.


Classic shoegaze bands to check out are My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride, Chapterhouse, Lush, Medicine and Lovesliescrushing.
Contemporary bands to investigate are Astrobrite, A Place To Bury Strangers, The Daysleepers, Engineers, Cheatahs and Flying Colours.

, A lot of shoegaze musicians use studio techniques to enhance their unique vocal style.When a band records a song, an individual “track” is recorded for each instrument separately. The vocalist gets their own track, too. These separate tracks are then mixed together in a studio or with software to create the final version of the song. Most songs are mixed so that the vocals are bright and audible over all the other instruments.In shoegaze, the vocals are tucked just under the guitar so that they blend in rather than stand out.


This is one of the most popular studio techniques for mixing vocals in shoegaze songs.
Common software programs used are Pro Tools, Logic and Ableton.
Individuals making music at home find these software programs very useful because they provide a lot of the same features as a professional recording studio.

, Guitar pedals are probably the most important pieces of equipment for someone who plays shoegaze music. Shoegaze is very guitar-oriented and these effects pedals help to create the genre’s signature sounds – fuzz, distortion, feedback, reverb and delay.These effects pedals aren’t just used with guitars. You can connect a microphone to an effects pedal and run the vocals through it, which will put the effects on your voice.With pedals you can distort your voice, change the pitch, change the tone, make it echo and delay, and much more.Putting effects like this on the vocals helps to create shoegaze’s otherworldly sound and atmosphere.

, Recording vocals at a lower decibel makes them easier to mix behind the guitars. When the vocals are quieter, they blend into the guitars and become less distinct.


This results in dreamy sounding vocals that weave around and behind the fuzzy, distorted guitars."

Find the break between head voice and chest voice.,
Sing across your break.,
Train your larynx to lie low.,
Sing 5-note chromatic scales.,
Slur your scales.,
Practice lip trills.",How to Sing in Mixed Voice," Sing ascending and descending scales. Feel your voice resonate: when do you feel it in your chest, and when do you feel it in your head? You will feel higher notes in your head, and lower notes in your chest. The notes that prompt you to switch from head to chest and vice versa are called your register break.


Sing until you are sure which notes prompt you to switch. This will vary depending on how high or low your individual voice is.;
, Sing the scales again, and try to sing across the break in your register (to avoid the clunk at the break-over point in your voicing). To do this, focus on maintaining the feeling of singing low notes from your chest as the notes begin to rise higher and shift (suddenly) into your head voice. If this feels strange, add your nasal voice to mix with chest voice by singing ""ng"" (like ""ing""), by pronouncing the ""g"" as ""gah"" to find and learn this transition. Do scales pronouncing ""nnga"". Notice holding the ""nnn"" sound in ""ng"" is felt in the head/nasal voice area but ""ng"" blends immediately into the chest voice ""ga"" felt in the lower/chest-throat area.Your nasal tone may sound unpleasantly twangy at first, but it will strengthen your ability to bridge the break point. As your ability to sing in mixed voice improves, the nasal tone can eventually give way to a blended, pleasant tone by listening to yourself to notice how it sounds. So you culture/cultivate your voice by practicing your blending so your voice is not either head or chest but a blended voice much of the time.
Modify your vowels. Vowels work differently in head and chest voices. If you try to force your vowels to remain consistent across your register break, you will not achieve middle voice.
Sing elongated vowels gently across your break, and notice where they naturally change. A long ""i"" (as in ""sigh"") will become a short ""i"" (as in ""trip.""), etc.
Begin blending voice before you hit the hard break point. Don't try to jump into your other voice. Rather, realize you're approaching a change to head voice while notes are rising but you're still comfortably below your break upward in the notes. Also, begin blending as you're approaching the shift to chest voice notes while you are still above your break point.

, Learn not to strain, to relax a little. Practice the special sounds that will show you how to naturally lower the tension in your larynx. Sing either word word given below, one-at-a-time:

""Gug"" on a low note in your range, and continue singing ""gug"" up and down through a major arpeggio (each of the notes of a major chord sung separately).
Sing ""Mum"" in the same manner. So, your larynx tends to strain to rise as you sing higher notes, but to get to your mixed voice you will want it to stay lower even as you climb to higher notes into the nasal/head voice.






Don't force/strain your larynx. Sing the tones patiently into their place.

, Chromatic scales are composed of notes in sequence, like the keys of a piano. Start with a scale a few notes below the break point in your register—the moment you normally switch from chest voice to head voice. Sing 5-note chromatic scales above, through, and below the break, in ascending and descending patterns.Keep your tone even, and go slowly. Don't rush the difficult notes.
You will naturally blend your head and chest voices if you sing below and above your register break without changing your tone.
Play along on a piano as you sing, or sing along to a recording of vocal exercises.
You can easily find free recordings of 5-note chromatic scales for vocal exercise online.

, While warming up, sing short scales. Rather than singing each note distinctly, ""slide"" your voice from one note to the next. Sing up and down a scale. Go slowly and do not allow yourself to vary your speed, so that you don't skip over your register break., Yawn widely to stretch your lips. Purse your lips and say ""buh-buh-buh"" while singing a scale. Try to make a good clear noise, not releasing too much air. If your lips keep losing the trill, stop and yawn, or put a finger in each cheek on either side of your mouth.Use this exercise regularly. The beginning of your routine is a good time for it, as it warms up your mouth.
Do your trills for a scale longer each time.

Be aware of your facial expression.",How to Sing in Front of an Audience," The only real way to successfully perform is practice. In the weeks leading up to your performance, make sure you make time each day to practice. If you've rehearsed well, you'll do a better job the day of your performance.Incorporate practice time into your daily routine. Take an hour or so to practice each day.
Challenge yourself a little more with each practice session. At first, you may sing while reading the lyrics on the page. As you continue to practice, try to rely more and more on memorization alone.
To study your stage presence, try singing in front of a mirror and studying your facial expressions. You can also record yourself singing and play it back to yourself. You can identify any weak spots and focus on those in another practice session.;
, Performing a song is more than just hitting the right notes. You want to know what a song means so you can deliver the lyrics with the right resonance. As you prepare for your performance, strive to learn about the song.Think about the speaker behind the song. How does the speaker feel and why? With a song from, say, a musical this can be easy. You can look into the character's history. With a song with a more abstract narrator, however, the information you have about the singer is limited to the song. Read through the lyrics and try to analyze what's happening emotionally. How does the narrator feel? Why?
Try to learn a bit about the writer of the song. This can help you better understand what the song may be about. If a writer has a sad romantic history, for example, knowing this brings a lot of added context to a love song.

, If you're nervous about singing on stage, try attending a few karaoke nights with friends or family members. Karaoke can present you with a low stakes chance to test out your skills to a small audience. This can be especially helpful if you're singing a popular song that's likely to be an option for karaoke selection., One of the most important aspects to a live performance is making sure you remember your lyrics. If you're nervous, it's easy to slip up and forget a line or two. There are a lot of tricks you can use to memorize lyrics quickly.Focus on one verse at a time. Trying to memorize the entire song in one sitting will be too stressful.
It can help to walk fast as you recite the lyrics. Reciting the lyrics quickly, with quick body motion, forces you to say them without thinking. This can help the lyrics become an automatic response.
Focus in on the lyrics you typically forget. There may be a certain pattern, and being aware of this pattern can help you remember when to focus more during a performance. For example, you may have pronoun issues. You may have a tendency to say ""I"" and ""me"" instead of ""you."" Try to be conscious of this as you proceed to sing for an audience.

, Feedback can be a great way to prep yourself for a performance. A listening audience can provide you with tips and advice on where to improve.It can help to choose people who are not afraid to be constructively critical. You want to sing to someone who's willing to give fair feedback. Do not select someone who's overly positive or overly negative.
You should also pick someone who knows something about singing. If you have a friend or family member who sings as well, this could be a great person to listen to you perform.

, When you go up on stage, think back to the song. Remember the song's meaning before the music starts. Ask yourself a few questions about the song to get yourself in the proper mindset to perform.Who is the speaker in the song? What is he or she thinking? Where has he or she been? Where does he or she hope to go?
Who is the song for? Is the speaker singing to a generic audience, or is this song directed at a particular person?

, You should also think about your audience as you sing. Try to feel the energy in the room. If you're playing a rock song to an audience who's getting wild and excited, you should play to that energy. Sing with more charisma and intensity. If you're playing to an audience who are quiet and respectful, try to tone down your delivery slightly.

, How you sing into the microphone can affect your sound on stage. Make sure you sing into the microphone in a way that produces a desirable sound.Hold the microphone by the shaft instead of the head, as not to muffle the sound.
If you're singing at a lower frequency, sing close to the mic. If you're singing louder, or in a more booming voice, keep your head away from the microphone.
If you don't like the sound you're getting, try switching the angle slightly. This can help tweak the sound just slightly.

, It's perfectly normal to feel stage fright when singing for an audience. There are steps you can take to combat this sense of stage fright.Prior to taking the stage, do some exercise. Go for a walk or a run. Do some stretches. Exercise is great at stress reduction.
Pose questions for yourself before each line that ask about the line's context. This is a trick that allows you to pretend you're answering an individual's questions instead of singing to a big crowd. For example, say you're singing ""Eleanor Rigby"" by the Beatles. Before the line, ""Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice in the church where the wedding has been,"" imagine someone asking you, ""What does Eleanor Rigby do after the wedding?""
If you're feeling insecure, remember any compliments you've received for your singing in the past. This can help fuel your passion and keep you focused on stage.

, Practice deep breathing on stage in order to make sure you have enough energy to sing. This can also help calm your nerves on stage. Breathe deep into your stomach over your chest. Momentarily tense your muscles as you breathe in, and then relax them as you breathe out., It can be fun to add a bit of spontaneous movements on stage. People may get tired of watching someone simply sing. Try to add a few fun moves to your routine, like pacing on stage or gesticulating with your hands.You can try walking and then changing direction every time the speaker has a new line. This can help show you're moving through thoughts on stage.
You can also try moving your hands to the rhythm of the music.

, While moving on stage can help, you want to make sure you're aware of your body. In order to help yourself navigate turns, try doing something called spotting. This means you focus your gaze on something off stage, like a member of the audience. This can help keep you grounded in the moment and prevent you from losing track of yourself in the excitement of the movement.You should also focus on what your body is doing. Strive to be aware of your hands and face as you sing. Avoid distracting gestures, like playing with your hair or picking at your fingers.
Also, be aware of your posture. Try to stand tall when singing. Not only does this convey confidence, it can help elevate your voice.

, You may feel nervous on stage and shake slightly. Try to move when you feel this sensation. This can help ground you, and add a little spice to your performance.

Swing your hips and do a small dance. This can help make you look like more of a performer, while simultaneously distracting you from stage fright.
Try to dance to the beat of the music. Tap your feet and wiggle your shoulders slightly.

, It's a good idea to strive for an appropriate facial expression when singing. You don't want to be grinning during a sad song or looking weepy during a happy anthem. Try to be aware of your expression.


Think about the song as you sing it. You'll be more likely to use the appropriate expression if you're really invested in the words.
It may be a good idea to sing in front of a mirror in the weeks leading up to your performance. You can use the mirror to gauge whether you have a tendency to grimace or make an unpleasant face while singing.

Place your hands on your lower back to lift your sternum, and maintain it in that position when you have lowered your hands.Imagining a string pulling you upright from the top of your head can help you maintain your posture.
Try to stay relaxed as tension will compromise your voice; keep your shoulders down and abdomen relaxed.;
, Do not gulp air, even when trying to maintain a long note. Breathe quickly and steadily. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, inflating your abdomen (diaphragm), keeping your shoulders relaxed as your breathe.It may help to imagine a rubber ring around your abdomen. As you breathe in try to expand your abdomen and push against the ring.
Use all of your breath. Don't sing in a breathy voice, as this releases air you need to support your notes.
Stay relaxed, as tension in your body can impact the quality of your sound.

, Always warm up, as this will improve the quality of your voice and prevent strain or damage to your vocal chords. You can try humming, massaging your jaw, or saying any of these warm up exercises:""The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue, the tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips.""
""A box of biscuits, a box of mixed biscuits, and a biscuit mixer.""

, You may have a lovely tone when you sing, but if you sing the wrong notes the effect will be spoiled. Train your ear by playing notes and singing them. Warm up by singing ""do re mi"" scales.


Consider learning an instrument, such as guitar or piano. This will improve your ability to distinguish notes.
Try out an ear training app.

, Your range is the span between the highest and lowest notes you can sing. Practice singing up and down a scale to tell what is most comfortable for you. To do this, sing the note that is most natural for you, and gradually take the pitch up and down without straining your voice.Try singing vowels. This can be a great way to explore your range.

, If your singing hurts, or feels uncomfortable, stop. If you feel you have to ""push"" to reach a note, you are straining. If you want to reach a note outside of your range, don't force it. Instead, take time to expand your range.Drink room temperature water to keep your vocal chords hydrated.

, Learn to articulate while you sing, ensuring the way you pronounce words does not interfere with the delivery of the lyric. Place varying emphasis on the words you are singing, giving extra weight to important words or words on prolonged notes.Try exaggerating your facial expressions as well, practicing in front of a mirror.
Be mindful of your tongue. It should rest at the bottom of your mouth with the tip touching the back of your teeth.

, A good vocal teacher can help you train your ear and expand your vocal range and power. Get an experienced teacher, or take classes from a professional singer who has received extensive training.


If you live near a university with a strong arts program, call the music department and ask if any graduate students give classes.

, You may choose to practice 20 minutes every day, for instance. Each time you practice, be sure to utilize excellent posture, thoroughly warm up, and focus on your breathing.


Try a variety of breathing and vocal exercises to determine what feels best and works for your range.
As with any muscle, the muscles used to sing can tire and strain; be mindful of this, taking breaks between exercises, and always warm up thoroughly.

, Practice singing jazz, pop, R&B, folk, country, and rock. Your voice may be better suited to some styles than others. Singing along to CDs can be a great way of experimenting with new types of genres and ranges.

, Pay close attention to the vocal range. Try singing along with those songs to determine your comfort level with the highest and lowest notes in the composition.

, It can be very tempting to pick songs by your favorite artists or in your preferred genre. For those of us with a limited vocal range, finding the right song is crucial to a successful performance.

, Once you have selected a song, try singing it a few times, and then record yourself singing it. Play the recording back, paying attention to your tone, pitch, and articulation. Try again (and keep the original recording), and play it back once more to help refine your delivery.

, Adjust the melody of the song to be within your range, taking the notes down or up an octave. This strategy can help you practice songs outside of your range and determine what feels most comfortable.

Breathe properly throughout the performance.",How to Sing In Front of Group of People," The longer you have to prepare and incorporate the song into your being, the easier it will be to perform. Avoid the feeling that you are in a rush to get prepared and may fall short of time to be truly ready.;
, If your schedule allows, set aside at least two half hour time blocks each day. Use this time to sing, practice, plan, or visualize your success.

, Make sure it matches your vocal range and also your personality. If there is a disconnect, choose another song that you might explore for compatibility.


If you find yourself straining to reach more than a couple of notes in the song, it is not for you. It is best to choose one that is comfortably within your vocal range and stylistic capability. This will help you to feel more comfortable and at ease when the time comes to perform on stage.

, This means that you need time to warm up properly, work on your breathing and practice the song a couple of times, at least. Do not strain your voice or endurance. In other words, do not work too long and in marathon sessions. Instead, work within a range of comfort.


Concentrate, at first, on just getting the lyrics right and hitting the right notes.
It may help if you vocally emphasize certain parts of the song in your unique way. This passage will act as a familiar signpost to guide you through your delivery routine.
If you don't have the lyrics down pat, it will increase your self-doubt and your nervousness. You may get embarrassed. Make sure you fully know the lyrics to help you on performance day. Transitions and stylizing the song will help you to gain confidence and familiarity with the song variations and the lyrics.

, This is an important aspect of priming your body and your mind for the performance. It is important to visualize positive outcomes and a positive audience reaction. This visualization should be a part of your practice every day and can be incorporated at odd moments throughout the day.

Think about why you felt or still feel embarrassed. Making mistakes is part of being human. If your anxiety stems from having unreasonable expectations, remember that you aren't perfect.
Laugh at yourself.We may be in the age of humiliation, but it only matters if you internalize it.
Assess your strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. Being humble about your abilities will help you feel confident about what you can accomplish.
Be responsible for your errors. If your embarrassment stems from a simple mistake, owning up to it is the first step towards being getting over it and being confident.;
, There are many types of voices, and just because yours is different doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad Don't apologize for your singing voice. There is no true right or wrong voice.
Singing, especially in church, is about the happiness and meaning the act brings you, not necessarily about how you sound.
Concentrate on group singing. Your voice may blend better when singing with the congregation or the choir.
Remain hopeful no matter how you sound. Use positive reinforcement and convince yourself you sound fine. Tell yourself, ""It doesn't matter what happens. I will persevere and sing with my heart.""

, The act of singing in church is considered a form of prayer. Focus on the fellowship. It is referenced within the Bible as being a way to praise God: ""Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,"" Ephesians 5:19. What makes singing powerful is the positive feelings it can bring. ""Come let us sing for joy to the Lord,"" Psalms 95:1.
Remember that you are singing for a community, which can be both comforting and empowering. There is nothing but love and support in the congregation.
Search for a song that conveys your feelings of love, worship, and faith. There are even some contemporary songs that have deep religious meanings.

, Improve your posture, breathe correctly with your diaphragm, and use the appropriate throat technique. Having the right technique can make a significant difference in how you sound.


Always do a proper warm-up before singing. It will help your voice to sound its best and will prevent potential injuries.
An easy fix to performance anxiety while singing is to slow your breathing down. Getting embarrassed can cause your breathing to become rapid and shallow, which can affect your voice.

Improve your voice without lessons by working on scales. The melodic start of ""Do Re Mi"" is familiar to us all, and helps train ears to hear correct sounds regardless of the key.

, Your voice is formed by several muscles, which require diligent exercise. Training your singing voice to sound differently takes practice everyday.


Sing as often as you can; sing in the shower, sing in the car, sing around the house. Practice anything from humming your favorite commercial ditty to singing church hymns.
Record and listen to yourself singing to gauge your pitch, technique, and overall sound. It can help you recognize the improvements you've made. Also, hearing your voice repeatedly played back can help you become more comfortable with how you sound.
Restrict your singing time. Focus on practice sessions of 20 minutes per day. Practicing too long can cause undue stress on the vocal muscles and put you out of commission for an extended period., Participating in choir is not only a great opportunity to boost your community involvement, but it's a perfect learning opportunity to improve your singing technique and bolster your confidence.


By singing in a group, you may feel less isolated and self-conscious than in singing individually.
There is evidence that regular participation in group choral activity can greatly improve physical and mental health. Try harmonizing. Your singing voice may not currently be strong enough individually, but as a complement to the primary melody your voice may resonate beautifully., The assistance of a professional voice coach can help you improve on your vocal range, singing technique, and confidence. Lessons can range in cost from $10-$75 for a half-hour, depending on the area and the voice coach's expertise and reputation.


Be sure your vocal coach diagnoses your vocal status. Not only do you both need to know your current abilities, but there also needs to be an expectation of the desired outcome.
Do your research on voice coaches in your area to decide which option is best for you. There are even online vocal coaches if you can't find someone perfect in your area.
A voice coach can help, over time, make your voice sound the best it can be. They can't make you sound like someone else or make you immediately sound amazing. Be patient and reasonable.

, Close acquaintances and friends will be more likely to critically evaluate your voice. Sing for few friends to gauge their collective opinion of your abilities.

, In most choirs there are bound to be countless years of experience and several strong voices. Seek opinions of those whom you admire, and follow their advice or guidance. They may even be willing to train you.

, Someone with years of musical experience may likely know how to help. He/she may suggest one of the following ideas:


There may be methods to accentuate the positives in your voice. Perhaps longer stretches of low notes or a specifically timed vibrato would work well.
Your voice might be better suited to specific songs. A specific hymn that fits your range could really display your natural abilities.
Simple voice control could be achieved more effectively via proper volume, chin position, and jaw angle., There may be much more to your embarrassment than just your singing voice.Millions of people are affected by social phobias that often extend to anxiety and depression.
The doctor may be able to help you if you are extremely self-conscious or worry excessively before singing. Treatment can potentially be psychotherapy, medication, or both.
Social phobias may extend simply beyond your singing. Don't let issue extend into other parts of your life.

Learn the different vocal ranges.,
Find Middle C. Middle C is also referred to as C4 in Scientific Pitch Notation on a music scale.,
Locate your vocal range.,
Practice your Tenor vocal range.,
Develop your head voice.,
Smooth your register break.,
Practice your falsetto voice.,
Relax your body, especially your mouth and your shoulder area.,
Start singing in your Head Voice.,
Open the back of your throat.,
Practice songs that have countertenor vocals.",How to Sing High Tenor," A vocal range is the span from the lowest to highest note that a voice can make. There are four main vocal ranges with several sub-ranges that people can produce.


Every person possesses a different vocal range, and while men typically fill out the lower ranges and women the higher ranges, some people possess an ability to span several ranges.
The four main vocal ranges from highest to lowest are: Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass.
Sub ranges include: Mezzo-soprano, Contralto, Countertenor/Tenor 1 or Tenor 2, Baritone. High tenor is also known as Countertenor or Tenor 1.;
, Middle C will help you find your vocal range since it’s in the middle of the piano or keyboard and a great starting pitch that most people can sing.


To locate middle C, Look for the name of the piano manufacturer in the center of the piano. You’ll see a grouping of five black keys in the middle separated by two white keys. The white key directly to the left of two black keys in the center of the piano is middle C.

, You can find your vocal range on a piano, keyboard, or with a computer program by singing along as you go up and down in the notes. To accurately find your full vocal range it’s best to do some vocal warm ups before you begin to loosen up your vocal chords.


Start warming your voice up by humming, allowing your pitch to slide up and down freely. Perform lip trills by pursing your lips and blowing air through them as if you were blowing bubbles underwater. Sing scales.Start at middle C and match pitch. Then progress downward on the piano hitting each note and matching its pitch.
Once you’ve gone as far down as you can and still produce a sound with your voice, make your way back up and continue matching pitch to notes until you’ve gone as high as possible being to sustain the note.
As you go higher up, you will have to sing in head voice and falsetto. Head voice is when you feel the vibrations in your head as you’re producing sound from higher up in your body. Think Mickey Mouse when trying to sing in head voice. Head voice marks the break in your voice, where you can’t smoothly hit a higher note. Falsetto, or “false voice” is when you feel that nasally pinch in the back of your throat.
Once you’ve gone as low and high as you can, count how many octaves your voice spans. Each octave is eight notes. Start at middle C and count down to the next C, remembering which is the lowest key you could hit. Repeat with the upper keys. Most people possess a range of 1.5 octaves.
High Tenor is in the (G♯2-)C♯3-B4(-E5) range.

, If you naturally sing in the tenor range, you’re well on your way to singing in high tenor. Locate middle C again and match pitch with an ""Ahhhhh"" sound.


Now locate the C an octave below Middle C, followed by the C an octave above Middle C. Match your voice to each note by going, ""Ahhhhh.""
Typically the highest note for a tenor is around the E5 key.

, Your head voice is like a bell. In order to master your head voice, you have to be able to access the resonance in your nasal cavity and employ your pharynx. The pharynx is the passageway that connects your nasal cavity to your larynx.Start in the middle of your range and produce an “Ng” sound. As you open your mouth into an “Ahhhh” sound and move up through the scale, really connect to the vibration you feel in the back of your neck.Head voice is a connected sound, as it still involves part of your chest. Meaning that you may not feel a break when transitioning from chest voice to head voice.
To strengthen your head voice, sing an “Ahh” sound starting at the upper middle point in your range and sliding up until you can’t sing any higher without transitioning into falsetto.
Do lip rolls. Lip rolls will help you learn to control your vocal cord closure, which develops a well rounded head voice.

, Register breaks occur when you transition from chest voice to a higher mode like head voice or falsetto. Breaks can also occur when coming back down, and can be smoothed out with proper technique and practice.You can learn to minimize your break by opening up the throat further through manipulation of vowels. This means not pronouncing vowels as you would when speaking. Instead drawing out and rounding vowel sounds to keep your larynx stable.

, Countertenors have the ability to produce a full sound in falsetto, sometimes allowing the voice to reach lower alto levels. Your falsetto doesn’t draw from your chest, but your nose and throat.If you’ve ever imitated a female voice, this is similar to falsetto.
To produce a well rounded falsetto sound, keep your larynx stable, and picture yourself closing around the notes, not pushing or straining them outward.
Start with the lowest note that you can in falsetto and practice scales going up and down until you can produce a consistent sound.

, They tend to be tensed when hitting high notes.


You might be tempted to raise your chin as if you’re reaching for the note, but this will strain your voice and restrict your vocal cords. Keep your head level.
Pull your shoulders back and align your spine in a straight line, extending through the crown of your head.

, It will help you hit the higher notes and it should be very light sound. Project your voice from your nasal cavities.When you sing higher notes your vocal cords get tighter and smaller, like the strings on a guitar.
Don’t think about reaching up to hit higher notes. This will cause your voice to strain. Instead, picture reaching out farther in front of you to grab the notes.

, Begin by singing an “Ahh” sound in your chest voice, and move up the scale. Notice how the pharynx and back of your throat feel when singing in your chest voice.As you ascend the scale, keep your throat open and try not to let your pharynx move up in your throat.
You’re still still drawing breath from your diaphragm, but you’re not involving your nasal passages as much as you would when singing in chest voice.
Pinch your nose and sing. Though higher notes involve your nasal cavity, you’re not singing out of your nose. Pinch your nose and transition to head voice and falsetto. Work on being able to produce a consistent sound with your nose blocked.

, The best way to sing in high tenor is to practice repeatedly. By singing songs that force you to consistently hit higher notes you can begin to train your voice and expand your range. Consult a vocal coach to help you as well. Some countertenor songs are:


Alone in The Universe from Seussical the Musical.
Bring Him Home from Les Miserables.
Dentist, (The) from Little Shop of Horrors.
Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You from Jersey Boys.

Consider the type of choir you want to join.,
Find a local choir.,
Contact the person who runs the choir to ask about the possibility of joining.,
Go to rehearsals.,
Make friends - Choirs aren't just about singing.,
Learn to read the music.,
Listen to the people around you.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Do your best.",How to Sing in a Choir," Whether you like traditional choral music, barber shop, gospel or show music, there will almost definitely be a choir out there which suits you.;
, Ask around and search the internet to help find some local choirs you could join. Also, pay attention to advertisements in local meeting places, as it may be possible there is something going on there.

, Depending on the choir you have chosen, you may have to audition, but many choirs are happy to let anyone join.


It also may be a good idea to check at this point whether or not you will need to pay for membership, uniforms, or music.

, Being in a choir is a commitment - only going to half of the rehearsals will let down the other choir members. If you don't have the time, don't join.

, The friends you make at choir can be friends for life, so don't forget to socialize.

, You should pick this up as you go along, so don't worry about it too much. If you're having difficulty, ask somebody who sits near you to point you in the right direction; they will probably be more than happy to help.

, Unlike solo singing, the point of singing in a choir isn't to stand out, but to blend in. If you're singing too loud or out of tune it will be obvious. Listen to the people around you and try to match your singing to theirs.

, Choirs can give you some of the most amazing experiences of your life and help you achieve things you could not have done alone. Music is intended to be enjoyed by both listener and performer, so if you're not enjoying it then it probably isn't right for you. Don't feel you have to stay if you don't like it.

, Always come to rehearsal on time, practice at home, and if you can't hit a high note, don't worry, you can always mouth the words if you have to.

Lower your larynx.,
Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Experiment with vowel sounds.,
Warm up.,
Don't stress it.",How to Sing Higher1," This is where the vocal folds are located; it's also known as the voice box. When it's level, it's in the optimum position for singing. Unfortunately, as we sing and sing higher, it has a tendency to raise.


Releasing the “swallowing muscles” is a good step toward reversing a rising larynx. If that doesn't do it, you can start singing in a hooty tone, which will also help release the larynx down. Finally, spreading your vowels (like smiling) also can cause the larynx to rise, so instead think of making the vowels taller and more narrow.
Put your hand on your throat and feel your larynx. Move your tongue as far back as you can; you should feel a drop. Consciously keep the drop while you move around your mouth and tongue; this may be difficult at first, but with a few minutes' practice, you'll get it down.;
, Most people have a bad habit of breathing from the top of their lungs. Place a hand on your stomach and watch it move up and down. It should be expanding and contracting while you sing, not your chest.


Go ahead, sing while laying down! Place a book on your chest and don't let it move. This is a visual reminder that you should breathe from your diaphragm.

, Each voice has a specific sound or two that makes it easier to reach higher. As you do warm ups, experiment with different ones.


Stick to darker vowels. That means ""ah,"" ""eh,"" ""ih,"" ""oh,"" and ""oo."" Mimic an opera singer if you must. Do not mimic a Canadian.

, This is absolutely imperative to singing healthily and expanding your range. Everybody has their favorites and what works for them. Work with a bunch to determine what you like best.


Start at the low end of your range and do arpeggios going up.
At the higher end of your range, quickly stop your breath making a ""hup"" sound and release with a siren-like ""mo"". Go higher and higher with each turn.
Start on a lower note making a tuba sound, go up an octave and release at the top with an ""aww"" back down to the starting note (you may do arpeggios if you desire).

Remember to have your mouth, lips, and entire body ready for optimum warm up.



, If your voice is telling you that you're going too high, listen to it. Singing should be natural; if you have to push, it will sound strained.


If it starts to hurt, rest. You can pick up again in a few hours if you need to. The vocal folds are just like any other muscle -- they need time to get used to the workouts you inflict on them.

, Nothing is more embarrassing than forgetting lyrics to the song when you're in front of, let's say, one hundred people. The more you practice, the better you'll memorize the words and tune. Hint: think about what the song means. Try saying the lyrics as if you were talking to a friend. This will help you connect the ideas.

, It could be a parent, a friend, or your grandparents.


If you're singing a cappella, try to sing loud and proud. If you're singing with music, try to sing when you're supposed to sing. Don't wait for the accompanist -- they are supposed to be following you! If you're singing on a CD where the artist is also singing, sing with her/him. If there's no microphone, ""aim"" your voice at the folks in the back of the audience.

, Look at your friend in the audience, but you need to look at all the other crowd members as well. Don't stare at one person in particular, like the lady with a funny hat. Instead, look randomly at people. Remember, you want to help everyone enjoy the song!

, Practice as much as you need until you feel that you're ready and that you have the song down pat.

Stay away from cold water. It tenses your vocal folds up when they need to be relaxed to hit those notes. Tepid water is best.
Milk coats your vocal folds. It may feel good to drink, but its not good for your voice.
If you are feeling a strain, don't drink liquids that are too hot. Warm tea (with a bit of honey is fine); thin, room temperature liquids are best.

, You know those girls you see in Victorian pieces in the movies and on television? That's not a bad place to start.


If there's a back to your chair, don't use it. Keep your back straight and your arms loose.
Don't suck in your stomach. You're breathing from it, remember?!
Keep your body as relaxed as possible. Relaxing your voluntary muscles makes it easier to relax your less-than-voluntary ones.

, When you start feeling yourself reach vocally, do it physically. You'd be surprised how the physicality helps.


Start with your arm by your side at the beginning of your siren and make a circle as you go, reaching as high as you can vocally and physically simultaneously.
Think of throwing a frisbee when you do trills and high warm ups.
Some coaches advocate literally pressing down when you're warming up with arpeggios and hitting your vocal breaks. The idea is that pressing down with your hands reminds you to keep your larynx low.

, Simply enough, a professional's guidance will be the quickest way to seeing the results you want. However, keep in mind that every vocal coach is different and you'll obtain different results with each one.


Ask your potential coach questions about their own training, what techniques they employ, and what genres of music they'll be teaching you to start. Some coaches might give you a very poppy sound and others very classical; yet others a happy medium.

Take slow, relaxed breaths to release tension.,
Massage your face and jaw muscles to release jaw tension.,
Do some neck and shoulder rolls to loosen up the muscles.,
Drink a glass of warm water to relax throat muscles.,
Trill with your lips to warm them up.,
Stretch out your vocal chords with “sirens.” Round your mouth into an “o” position and inhale.,
Do two octave scales to warm up for higher notes.,
Breathe from your abdomen for a stronger sound.,
Start in the middle of your range and sing higher and higher.,
Experiment with your vowel sounds.,
Start putting a consonant in front of vowels.,
Sing the word ""yawn"" on the high notes to get your mouth in position.,
Keep your sounds smooth and connected.,
Cool down after each session to prevent injury.",How to Sing High Notes," Your breathing needs to be relaxed to hit high notes. Otherwise, that tension goes right into your voice. Take a normal breath in, then exhale. Keep your breath slow and even.


Relax your shoulders, neck and chest as you continue to breathe in and out. This helps release tension from those areas.;
, Put the heels of your hands on either side of your face, right below your cheekbones. Push them gently into your cheeks, then move them slowly down into your jaws. Let your mouth hang open a little bit. Repeat this several times., Slowly roll your neck from side to side. Once your neck feels stretched out, roll your shoulders gently and slowly, backward and forward. Then let your arms hang loosely at your sides.Try to keep your arms loose as you practice. Avoid the urge to ball up your fists or strain your arm muscles when trying to hit high notes.

, It also helps hydrate the vocal chords, allowing you to reach the higher registers. Add honey to your water to decrease and/or prevent their throat from swelling.Don't drink ice water, caffeine or milk before warming up your voice. These can have a negative effect on your singing voice.

, Press your lips together loosely. Release air through your mouth in a steady stream, so that your lips vibrate and make a raspberry sound. Move on to doing this with “h” sounds, maintaining a steady voice as you move the air past your lips.

Once you’ve got that, try it on “b” sounds. Then continue doing “b” sounds, but go up and down the scales., It helps to imagine you’re sucking down a spaghetti noodle! When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. Keep your “woo” steady and repeat this 2-3 more times.


After that, start going up and down the scales as you “woo.”, Starting in a low pitch, sing a “me” sound as you go up the scale. Reverse and go down the scale as you sing an “ee” sound. Keep going, up and down, gently increasing your range each time.


Once you’re feeling pretty loose, switch to an “oo” sound and repeat.During warm up, don't push your voice to go higher than what’s comfortable for you. This can actually decrease your range over time., As a singer, you’ve probably heard this advice countless times. It’s important, though! It helps you hit and maintain high notes, and helps to relax your muscles.When you inhale, your stomach should rise first, followed by your chest.
If you have trouble with this, try putting your hand on your abdomen as you breathe. It’ll remind you to focus on breathing from that area.

, This can be a continuation of the “oo” and “ee” sounds you used in warm-up. Once you get your voice up into the high register that you want, open up those vowel sounds to sound more like “oh” and “uh.”As you practice this over time, you’ll notice that the higher notes are getting easier and easier to reach.

, Each voice has certain vowels that work best when singing high notes. Others are harder to hit. You should experiment to determine which vowels work and sound best for you. Once you have an idea of which vowel works best, modify (gradually) towards that vowel as you ascend the scale.


For example, you might have a hard time hitting a long ""e"" (like in ""meet""), but you can easily hit a short ""i."" You could modify the long ""e"" in ""meet"" by singing ""mitt"" and subtly adjusting the ""i"" into the long ""e"" as you get higher., Consonants, like a hard “g,” can help you get better at cord closure. After practicing vowels for a while, put a hard “g” in front of them. This helps you maintain a steady sound by keeping your vocal cords vibrating steadily.Also work on consonants like “m” and “n” in front of vowels.
Cord closure is when your vocal cords come together to create a sound. If they aren’t “closed” all the way, it's difficult to maintain steady air flow., When rehearsing, never hesitate to sing the word ""yawn"" for one of those notes in your upper range. When you sing that word, it positions your mouth and throat in exactly the right place to hit high notes. This is a handy trick to help you get used to the proper mouth positioning; don't do this during a performance, though!

, Steady airflow allows you to hit and maintain your high notes. As you work on your range, keep your breath flowing in and out steadily. Strive to make smooth, connected sounds.Think about the whole phrase that includes the high note, then support your voice continuously from the beginning. This connects the high note to the notes before it.
Forcing out air on certain notes can strain your throat and voice.

, Working on high notes is hard on your vocal cords. To keep those muscles operating well, cool them down after you work them out. To do this, hum gently while making an “m” sound. Move up and down the scales as you make the “m” sound.Focus on how the sound feels coming out of your lips. It will vibrate and tickle a little bit!

Recognize that all voices have limits.,
Identify your own voice type to determine what notes you can likely reach.You can expand your vocal range with practice, but that doesn't mean you can change the natural tone of your voice.,
Remember your vocal limits.,
Choose appropriate repertoire and keys for your voice's current range.",How to Sing High Notes and Songs1," Most people have a natural range of 1 1/2 to 2 octaves, or about 16 notes. Therefore, the physicality of your voice might not allow you to sing very high notes without straining.


Most professionally-trained vocalists have a range of no more than four octaves. Few singers can ever achieve a range of six octaves or more. ;
, No matter what exercises and training you try, your voice may not be designed to hit certain notes.


Women with higher, soprano voices can typically sing notes between middle C (C4) and “high” C.
Mezzo, or second soprano voices can typically sing from A3 (the A below middle C) to A5 (the A two octaves above A3).
Alto voices can usually sing from about G3 (the G below middle C) to F5 (the F in the second octave above middle C).
Men with higher voices are typically tenors and can usually sing a range between the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the C one octave above middle C (C5).
Baritone vocal ranges usually fall between the second F below middle C (F2) to the F above middle C (F4).
Deeper bass voices can typically sing from the second E below middle C (E2) to the E above middle C (E4).
Even if you're unfamiliar with the actual music notes, it's important to recognize that all voices have limits.

, As you begin the exercises to expand your range, you don't want fatigue or damage your vocal cords. Over time, your range will expand, but you should be mindful to protect your voice in the meantime.

, Doing so will enable you to be the best-possible singer at any given time.

Listen to as much hip-hop music as possible.,
Listen actively.,
Memorize some verses.,
Write lots of rhymes.,
Keep ""rhyme clusters"" in your notebook.,
Hammer your lyrics into songs.,
Try to freestyle.,
Take your time.,
Check out a freestyle competition or a rap battle.,
Make original music.,
Put your music online.,
Keep practicing.",How to Start Rapping," You need to listen to a wide variety of hip-hop and rap before you start trying to make your own rhymes. Study the history and the culture of rap and try to understand the core and foundations of it. It's a living, breathing thing that you need to engage with. If you don't know who Big Daddy Kane is, or you only know Ice Cube as a funny guy in the movies, you've got some research to do.


Over the past few years, free online mixtape culture has become an important part of hip-hop.Lil Wayne's rise to fame in the mid-2000s was on the back of mixtapes given away for free online, some composed largely of freestyles. Checking out free mixtapes is a great way to jump into the conversation happening in contemporary hip-hop.;
, Study other rappers' skills until you can form your own style. You're not biting, you're learning. Copy out their rhymes and freestyles and read them as you would poetry. Studying their music is also good to find some solid beats that you may want to try rapping over.


Eminem is known for his quick flow, intricate rhyme schemes, and metrical perfection, while Lil Wayne is known for his great one-liners and similes. Find rappers that appeal to you. A$AP Rocky, Tribe Called Quest, Big L, Nas, Mos Def, Notorious B.I.G., Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, Freddie Gibbs, Jedi Mind Tricks, Army of The Pharaohs, MF Grimm, Jus Allah, Shabazz Palaces and the Wu-Tang Clan are very different and talented rappers or groups worth checking out.
Listening to rap that you specifically don't like can also be helpful in trying to craft a style. Form opinions. Make arguments. Debate with your friends about different rappers. Talk about who sucks and who's great.

, Pick a jaw-dropper from one of your favorite tracks and listen to it repeatedly, until you've committed it to memory. Recite it as you walk around. Get a feel for the syllables and the flow of the words, the way the words feel as you say them.


Think about what stands out for you about this verse. What do you like about it? What made it memorizable?
Find an instrumental version of the song with the verse you've memorized and practice reciting it to the music. This will help you get a feel for the flow and the speed at which the music occurs.

, Keep a notebook with you at all times, or use your phone to write down rhymes, and try to write at least 10 rhymes a day. At the end of the week, go back through the rhymes you wrote and pick out the best ones to create a ""Best of the Week"" list, which you might use to start a song. Cut out the wack lines and corny stuff and only keep the best.


At the end of the week, you might only end up with a couple of lines. That's ok. That's good. When you're first starting out, you're going to write a lot of crappy lyrics. There's no way around it. It takes work and lots of effort to create songs that anyone will want to listen to.

, A rhyme cluster is a group of short lines and words that are all interchangeable with each other. So, any lines with words like ""wack"" ""sack"" ""jack"" ""backpack"" and ""Aflac"" could all be in the same cluster. Start building an encyclopedia of rhymes that you can start to memorize, and consult when you're writing songs or free styling.

, After a couple of weeks of writing lines, you should start having a good store of them built up. Add a couple together, move them around, and start thinking about how you might build a song. Write more lines to fill in the gaps and put it all together.



Story songs usually have a hard-luck element to them in classic hip-hop. Stories need to address the Who, What, and When elements to paint a vivid picture of the scene or the event you're describing. Raekwon and Freddie Gibbs are great story-telling rappers.

Boast raps feature lots of one-liners. Look no further than Lil Wayne for the self-crowned king of bragging in rhyme. Use lots of similes and metaphors to compare yourself to all manner of greatness.

Pop rap or trap is all about the chorus. Chief Keef's rhymes may be super terrible, but he's got an ear for a killer hook. Aim for a simple line or two that slides right into the beat. ""Don't Like"" and ""Sosa"" have simple ear-worm choruses that get stuck in your head for weeks. Ditto Soulja Boy's ""Crank That."" For more classic examples, think of Wu-Tang's ""C.R.E.A.M."" and anything by Snoop Dogg.

, Find a beat you like, an instrumental version of a track you're into, or just try rapping over the intros and the outros. Find the beat, feel it, and try to start spitting what you've got bouncing around in your head.


Start with a good ""starter line,"" something that pops and gets your mind going, then rely on your clusters of rhymes to start letting things unspool from there.
Don't try free styling in front of anyone until you've practiced a lot. It can fall apart quickly, but try to stay on beat, keep with the flow and find your way again if you start to stumble. Don't stop, or it'll be over. Even if you have to rap nonsense syllables, make sure they rhyme and stay with it.

, You're not going to write great songs yet. Focus on the little things, getting better at freestyles, and learning to write songs. Develop your own voice and style without biting from other rappers. You don't want to be just like any of them, you want to be your own voice and your own rapper.


Even Chief Keef and Soulja Boy, rappers who hit big at 16 and 17, didn't pop out of their mamas writing hit songs, it took them 6 or 7 years of rapping constantly before they found the goods. Be critical of your work, if you're going to take rapping seriously. GZA was 25 before he found success, and he had been rapping since he was a child.

, Here, contestants have to freestyle over a beat selected by the DJ and you'll be timed, so you won't be given much time to think before you've got to start rhyming. If you want to battle, you'll also have another MC across from you who may be more experienced and eager to embarrass you with crude diss lines to get cheers from the audience. This is one of the most exciting parts of the rap game, but you'll need to develop thick skin and considerable skills before trying this in public.


It's a good idea to attend a lot of competitions before attempting to compete in any of them. Get a good feel for your skills and the skills of the other competitors before jumping on stage.

, try to get in touch with some up-and-coming producers in your area or online to provide you with some original beats to work with. If you have a beat, making hip-hop music requires little more than the most basic audio editing software and a microphone.


Attending shows, competitions, and battles is a great opportunity to meet other rappers and beatmakers you might collaborate with, or who might have resources to share with you.

, If you eventually get enough material that you're proud of, start a YouTube channel for your music and start sharing your music across social media. Put a mixtape together and release it for free on the Internet. Increasingly, rappers who get signed to big contracts generate publicity and buzz by releasing free mixtapes.


Burn CD-R copies of your music and give it out at concerts or gatherings with your contact information included on it.

, Keep beats on your phone or iPod, and freestyle inside your head while doing every day things like walking down the street, taking the bus or train, or grocery shopping. The more you practice your rhymes, the better they'll get.

Drink plenty of warm water to hydrate your vocal cords.,
Relax your face in order to avoid injury and reach higher notes.,
Warm up your voice before singing.,
Repeat your warm-up exercises daily.",How to Sing High Notes and Songs2," Don't drink ice water or milk before singing. Temperate water is best.


Many singers drink water mixed with honey, lemon juice or both before singing to relax and lubricate their vocal cords., Place your index fingers over your chin, with your thumbs placed on the fleshy section underneath your chin. Softly massage this area to loosen up the muscles.


Open your mouth and eyes as far as you can, then scrunch your face up as much as possible. Repeat this exercise a few times.
Yawn widely to stretch your face and jaw.
Stretch your neck and shoulders to release tension that can discourage singing.

, You need to warm up your vocal cords just as you would warm up your muscles before strenuous exercise. Warm ups can include humming along to your favorite tune or singing a simple song such as ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" or ""Mary Had a Little Lamb.""


It is best to warm up the middle vocal range before moving to the high and low extremes.

, Also remember to warm up before and after each time you sing. Think of expanding your vocal range just like touching your toes. The more often you repeat the stretch before and after exercise, the more flexible it will become.


By stretching your vocal muscles every day, the muscles will become accustomed to being stretched, and you will find it easier and more comfortable to sing higher notes.

"
"
Hum a single note in the middle of your vocal range.,
Sing a note at the bottom of your natural range with an, ""mmm,"" sound.,
Move up the musical scale, alternating the ""mmmm"" and ""aahhhh"" with each note.,
Move higher up the scale in your falsetto voice until you again hit the top of your range.,
Sing your highest comfortable note, extending it as long as possible.",How to Sing High Notes and Songs3," Be aware of where in your head you are making the sound resonate. The sound should be projected forward and should resonate in your sinuses around your nose and forehead, not in the back of your throat.

, Next open your mouth to an, “ahhhh,” sound. Make sure to keep the same feeling of resonance in your head for both closed and open sounds.

, When you reach your vocal break, switch to your falsetto voice tone and continue. Work on having a clean switch between the two tones.

, Focus less on the actual note and instead on producing on a clean, crisp sound and resonance as you move up the scale.

, Then try the next one. You’ll soon discover you can sing higher while practicing this exercise than you can while singing a song.

"
"
Sing a song that is higher than your typical vocal range by beginning the tune in a lower octave.,
Sing using your stomach, not your throat.,
Breathe with your diaphragm, while standing a straight as possible.,
Remember to switch to your falsetto voice as you sing notes at the top of your range.",How to Sing High Notes and Songs4," By starting the song in a lower key, you will be better able to reach the higher notes.Learn the song first, including the words and melody. Then sing the same melody but beginning at a note toward your lower vocal range. It may take some practice to remain in the new key.

, Singing high notes from your throat will only strain to your vocal cords. Use your stomach to push air through your throat as you sing the high notes. This will give them more power without straining you.

, As you inhale, your stomach should rise first followed by your chest. This is called ""support"" of the voice.

, As notes get higher, the sound waves they create get shorter and closer together, requiring less power to generate them. Focus the most vocal power on the low notes and decrease it as you sing higher."

Perform your rap.",How to Write a Rap Chorus or Hook," Maybe you have an idea for a chorus, but you need other lyrics, or maybe you have other lyrics, but need a chorus. Either way, you want your rap to have a general theme or main idea that comes across. Before you write your rap, brainstorm some ideas.


If you are stuck on ideas for your rap, you can visit websites online that have lists of song themes to get some ideas. Think about what you want to focus on in your rap. Is it going to be about a place, emotion, time frame, lifestyle, action, event, ect.? Do you want your rap to have a more upbeat, positive message or do you want to communicate something negative, difficult, or frustrating?
When brainstorming for a rap it's beneficial to think about your audience, or your desired audience. Rap artists Drake and Lecrae are very different in what they rap about and in their audience. Drake raps for a more secular audience while Lecrae's audience is mostly Christian based. As you construct your rap, you'll want to make sure you are writing something appropriate for your audience.;
, Many artists start creating their raps by first free styling and then writing down every emotion, thought, or idea that comes to mind. This can be a helpful step before you begin to write a rap, because you want your rap to be individual and personal to you.Sometimes it's helpful to keep a pen and paper with you or a notepad app on your phone so that you can write lyrics down throughout the day as they pop into your head. Sometimes artists come up with the best lyrics or inspiration for their songs at the times they are doing something completely different. Writing down these thoughts or ideas as they come to you will make it much easier to brainstorm for more lyrics later on.

, It's best to do this after you have brainstormed for a bit, to prevent the temptation of copying another artist's lyrics. After you have brainstormed some, it can be helpful to look at other artists and listen to their raps. You may be able to get some ideas for the structure or organization of the rap, or just ideas about how rappers use lyrics to form a story.The best way to start this is to look up your favorite artists. Your rap style is likely going to reflect theirs in some way, because you obviously like their music, so it can be a great way to get ideas or to understand the inspiration behind their rap. Don't copy their music, though. Blend their style with yours to create something that is uniquely your own.
Sometimes raps don't say it all, meaning there is more behind the lyrics. Try looking up some commentary on raps, so that you can further understand how artists take lyrics and use them to convey certain emotions or ideas to their audience.

, Some of the best art is created from a person's own experience. Think about the things in your life that are important to you, that you feel others should know about or you want others to experience, and use those emotions and memories in your rap to create something personal.Maybe you want to rap about family, success, a failure you experienced, heartbreak, etc. or you can rap about things that aren't necessarily personal to you, but you are passionate about like poverty, wealth, abuse, tolerance, etc.
Not all raps have to be personalized, but when someone sings or raps a song that is personal to them, often times it is easier to put more into the lyrics, which will help your audience latch onto the rap. Eminem's song ""When I'm Gone"" is moving because he raps about his relationship with his daughter.

, Just because the majority of rappers rap on certain topics, doesn't meant you have to. Some of the best, most entertaining raps are based on things that you would never think a rap song would be about. These types of raps can be interesting and can really attract a niche audience. So, rap on whatever topic you want, but don't feel like you have to fit into a box.


Weird Al may not be your typical rapper, but he uses other songs and creates a parody in his own music. He took the rap ""Ridin"" by Chamillionaire and Krayzie Bone and made it into his own rap ""White and Nerdy,"" which is well known for its creativity and humor.

, Sometime it's easier to pick a beat first, before you think of specific lyrics. It can also help inspire you when coming up with your hook, as you'll have some music to format the lines of your hook around. You can often find different types of beats online or you can create your own beats with certain software.A beat can also greatly depend on the emotions in a rap you are hoping to communicate. If your rap is about something positive then more of a fast beat may be good, but if your rap is about something difficult or sad, then a slower beat may be more appropriate. Or maybe you are rapping to express your anger or frustration, and so the beat really depends on the direction you are looking to take with your rap.

, You may have already done this as you were thinking of your theme of the rap. Some rappers like to write some of their lyrics first before coming up with the chorus, because they don't want the lyrics to be solely based around the chorus. Other artists will write the chorus first, and then use that as a basis for the rest of their rap. You might try picking one word and using that word as the main idea for your hook.


Lecrae uses the word ""boast"" in his song ""Boasting"" to communicate that depending on his self alone is a vain pursuit that leads to nothing. Although he only uses this word once in his hook, it's what he structures his rap around to communicate that boasting in himself alone is unwise because he's not guaranteed tomorrow.
There is no perfect formula for writing a rap. Do whatever is best for you, whatever helps you get your creative juices flowing.
The best hooks are the ones that advance the main idea without being super obvious about it. These hooks use creativity and different vocabulary to promote the main idea, without coming right out and saying it.
For example, Jay Z's song ""Hovi Babi"" has a hook with lyrics ""Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable."" He is essentially saying to his audience ""I am awesome"" but using a creative approach that communicates his idea without using those exact words., With the topic or word you have chosen, write your hook with each line communicating something different about your main idea. A typical chorus is made up of eight bars (4 verses) and usually follows a set of 16 bars.


A bar is essentially one line of a verse, which is usually divided up into two lines or two bars. Often times there are three sets of 16 bars and three choruses in a rap.
The classic way to structure a rap is around 16 bars. The first 16 bars of your rap should last about a minute, then you have the chorus, then another 16 bars, then the chorus again, maybe a bridge, and then the final chorus.

, To draw your audience into your rap, you want to create a story, giving pictures and examples of what your rap is communicating. The more you are able to put your listeners inside the scene, showing them the story and characters you have created, the more likely they will be able to get into the rap.


Macklemore's song ""Downtown"" uses imagery such as ""chromed out mirror... banana seat, a canopy on two wheels..."" and also uses action words like ""cruising through the alley... tip-toeing in the street..."" These lyrics really help create a scene that's easy to follow.

, When people recall rap songs, usually the first thing that pops into their head is the chorus, so you want the hook that you create to be catchy and stay on people's minds after they listen to it. It doesn't so much matter the topic of your hook for this, but depends more on the flow of the verses and the creativity put into them.


Some artists can create choruses that don't even makes sense, but because they are catchy and fun, people enjoy them and continue to listen to them. Your focus should be to create a hook that you would enjoy. In Sugarhill Gang's song ""Rapper's Delight"" the hook goes like this: ""I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie/ to the hip hip-hop, and you don't stop."" It doesn't really make sense but it's catchy and fun to sing.
Many great hooks are simple but powerful in what they say. Drake's ""Started from the Bottom"" features a hook that repeatedly says ""Started from the bottom,"" but it communicates to his audience that he has come a long way from where he started.

, Rhyming in a rap song is essential, but you don't want to write a verse just to make it rhyme. Start by writing your lyrics first, and then find words that are ""near rhymes,"" meaning if you tweak them a bit then they'll create a rhyme. Then, as you start to run out of these words, begin structuring your verses so that they will rhyme, but try doing so in a way that won't change the content or message of the verse.Usually lyrics rhyme after two lines (bars) -- the first line rhymes with the second line, the third with the fourth, ect. However, artists often put a break somewhere in the middle of their lyrics, with one line that stands alone and doesn't have a rhyming counterpart.
It may be helpful to use a rhyme dictionary or thesaurus when you get stumped on how to rhyme your lyrics.

, There are two different ways to execute a hook -- you can sing it or you can rap it. Artists that tend to combine pop music with rap like to sing their hooks, but pure rappers often just rap their hooks. You can choose one or the other or you can incorporate both into your rap.Chief Keek and and Lil Durk rap the majority of their songs, while Drake and Kanye West are examples of artists that occasionally combine rapping and singing.

, This is the best way to determine if your chorus and lyrics flow well together. Read your rap out loud or practice rapping it and pay attention to the content of the chorus and lyrics as well as the flow and structure of your rap.

, You may have practiced portions of your rap to the beat you have chosen, but you should perform the entire rap to the beat to listen to the connection of the lyrics to the music. You can also practice putting intonation in your voice to emphasize certain lyrics or the hook. , After you have practiced your rap, you may find that it is just as you want it, but it's possible that it needs some tweaking to improve the flow, continuity, or cooperation of the lyrics to the beat. Edit your lyrics or beat as necessary so that you achieve your best rap.

, Music is created for others to hear, so why not try performing your rap in front of a small audience or a friend? You can then ask for suggestions or constructive criticism.

Rap the verses and the hook together over the beat.",How to Start a Rap Song," Learn to identify the three key elements of a hip hop beat in a song: the kick, the snare, and the hi-hats. These three elements need to be placed in a music program in a consistent pattern to create a hip hop vibe.The kick is similar to the drum kick on drums. Most rap beats have syncopated kicks, or kicks that are in time with each other and follow a beat, which form the foundation of the beat. You can also layer your kicks, or use more than one kick at a time, to get a sharper sounding beat.The snare is works with the kick to create the rhythm for the beat. Most rap beats have a snare every other bar to give the beat more depth. You can layer your snare by adding in other percussion like claps or cymbals.The hi-hats give a rap beat a crisp and clipped sound, helping to keep the beat consistent and rhythmic. In rap songs, hi-hats are often played in an eight note pattern to keep the beat on time. You can also pause the hi-hats at certain points in the song to let the other instruments in the song shine through.;
, Before you create your own beat or look for original beats, you should focus on a certain sound you want to emulate or reference. This could be a Top 40 hip hop track or an obscure track from the 70s or 80s. You could also be inspired by music outside of hip hop, like soul or funk music or even folk music.You can then treat your rap song as a tribute to an existing track or another artist who is making music you respect and admire. Think of your song as a unique take on an existing sound.
You may also want to create a certain mood with your song, such as a song to party to or bang to, or a more serious and socially conscious rap song. Most party songs tend to have a quicker tempo and a melody that people will want to dance or move to. A more serious or somber rap song may have a darker or heavier and slower beat.
There are many computer programs that allow you to create beats quickly and easily. These programs, like Fruity Loops, often give you access to large sound libraries that you can play around with and manipulate as you create a beat.

, You can find many free original beats online that you can repurpose for your rap song.Keep in mind the sounds that you are using for inspiration and look for an original beat that best matches your inspirational song.


If you are planning to create a high energy party rap song, you may look for an original beat that sounds a lot like your favorite party rap songs. If you are planning to create a more somber or serious rap song, you may look for an original beat that emulates your favorite serious or somber rap songs.

, Many rap artists will sample a portion of an existing track and integrate it into their original song, making it part of the beat of the song. You can take a section of an existing track and see how it might fit within your song, either as part of the beat or even as a vocal sample in the hook of your song.Many popular rap songs are based on samples. A list of sampled songs in hip hop can be found on Whosampled.com., A typical hip hop song has the following structure:The intro: There is usually a 10-30 second intro where there is no rapping and the beat is introduced. Some rap artists may put shout outs or tags in their intro, often spoken instead of rapped.
First verse: Each verse is usually 16 bars or 32 lines. Bars are two lines that follow each other.
Chorus: Also known as the hook, the chorus would be eight bars or 16 lines. However, the length of the chorus can vary and may be shorter than 16 lines.
Second verse: The second verse should build on the images or ideas presented in the first verse in 16 bars.
Chorus: Repeating the chorus or hook will make your song stick in the listener’s head.
Third verse: This is the final verse, where you take the images or ideas you created in the first and second verse and build on them to a final conclusion or idea in 16 bars.
Final chorus and outro: The chorus repeats one final time and then the rap artists will have an outro where the beats fade out or come to a full stop.

, Take a moment to think about a certain topic or theme that you would like to explore in your song. This could be something as simple as your favorite hangout spot in your neighborhood or a more abstract concept like violence, anger, or racism. Many rap songs are also brag songs, where the rapper talks about how fly she is or how she started from nothing and made it to the top.


Write down as many words as you can that relate to your topic or theme and then highlight the strongest terms. You can also use the strongest words to create images or phrases that rhyme. These images or phrases could then become bars in your rap song.
For example, for a song about your favorite neighborhood joint, you may write down “friendly”, “special”, “open to all”, and “old school”. You may also think of specific images like the smell of the seats at the counter, the taste of the food, and the sound of the old school rap music coming from the speakers.

, A rapped hook is often performed by the rap artists who also performs the verses, though you can have a guest rapper do the rapped hook or another rapper in your crew. A sung hook is usually done by an R&B vocalist. You can also use a sample from an existing track as your hook, but you should adjust or manipulate the sample so it has your unique spin or take.On the track “Gin & Juice” by rapper Snoop Dogg, there is a rapped hook: “Rollin’ down the street, smokin’ indo, sippin’ on gin and juice/Laid back (with my mind of my money and my money on my mind)”.On a track “Foolish” by the R&B artist, Ashanti, there is a sung hook: “See my days are cold without you/But I’m hurtin' while I’m with you/And though my heart can’t take no more/I keep on running back to you”., The hook is perhaps one of the most important elements of any rap song, and many rappers start by creating the hook or chorus first. They will then use the hook as a basis for their verses. Your hook should be short and to the point, no longer than eight bars. Often, simplified hooks or choruses are more effective and appealing to the listener.For example, perhaps one of the most well known hooks in hip hop is in The Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight”: I said a hip-hop, the hippie the hippie/To the hip hip-hop, uh you don’t stop rockin’,/To the bang bang, say up jumped the boogie,/To the rhythm of the boogie the beat”.
While this chorus does not make much sense logically, it is fun and catchy. It also uses repetition and alliteration in a playful way.

, The hook should remind the listener of the song’s theme or topic and work to reinforce it or restate it. If your theme is having a good time at a club, your hook should sum up this theme in eight to sixteen bars. If your theme is more about a character’s journey, your hook should reinforce a running theme or issue in the character’s journey.


For example, Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” has a rapped hook that builds on the theme of performance and making your dreams come true:

“You better lose yourself in the music, the moment/You own it, you better never let it go/You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow/This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo”., Start to create verses in the 16 bar format. Link lines together in pairs and have them run one into the other so they connect and create an overall image or picture of your theme or subject matter.For example, in the rap song, “Lose Yourself”, Eminem explores the theme of performance and power through music. In the song’s first verse, Eminem sets up the anxiety and fear that goes into performance and proving yourself as an artist with the opening bars:

“His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy/There’s vomit on his sweater already, mom’s spaghetti”Eminem then goes on to explore the theme of performance through the main character or subject of the song, the rapper Rabbit:

“He’s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready/To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting/What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes loud/He opens his mouth but the words won’t come out”, Many rap artists will listen to the beat for the song and then write verses based on the sound of the beat. Play through your chosen beat and try to fashion your verses to match the tempo of the beat. This could lead you to create shorter bars, with certain end words or the repetition of specific words that seem to work well with the beat.For example, in “Lose Yourself”, the beat of the song dictates the way Eminem raps his verses and the way each line becomes a bar. In the first verse, there is a shift that occurs due to a change in the beat. Eminem raps the following four bars according to the change in the beat:

“He’s choking, how? Everybody’s joking now/The clock’s run out, times up, over-blaow/Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity/Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he’s so mad but he won’t”., Most rappers will rap over the beat to find the right rhythm and cadence in their verses. Play the beat in the background as you write your verses and tweak the verses to try to match the beat. This will give the song more of a sense of flow and ensure your verses mesh well with the beat.Work one verse at a time, perfecting each verse until you move to the next one. You may also call back to an image or line in the first verse of the song, referencing it again in your third and final verse.
For example, in “Lose Yourself”, Eminem calls back to the song’s opening image, of sweaty palms, weak knees, heavy arms, in the final verse of the song. He contrasts the fear and anxiety of the first verse by portray his subject taking off or taking flight, no longer trapped by his fear.

“Mom, I love you but this trailer’s got to go/I cannot grow old in Salem’s Lot/So here I go it’s my shot, feet: fail me not/This may be the only opportunity that I got”., Once you have crafted your three verses and your chorus or hook, you can rap them in one take over the beat. If you are using a sung hook, you may want to start by rapping the verses over the beat first and then adding in the sung hook later. Once you start to place the elements of the song together, you are on your way to crafting a completed rap song.

Treat listening to Nicki's raps and rhymes like it's your job. Study her new stuff, her old stuff, and her best feature verses on other people's songs.


Nicki's three studio albums are:

Pink Friday
Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded
The Pink print


Nicki's official mixtape releases include:

Beam Me Up Scotty
Playtime is Over
Sucka Free

;
, If you want to dig a little deeper to learn how Nicki crafted her sound, it's good to listen to the same people that she listened to. If you're a super fan, you owe it to yourself to check out her favorite artists, as well as her stuff.She's even had Twitter feuds with a few of these people, she's got so much in common with them. Nicki was most influenced by the following pop and rap artists:


Madonna
Lil Kim
Missy Elliot
Eve
Janet Jackson
Trina
TLC
Lil Wayne
Cyndi Lauper
Enya

, The most important part of rapping like Nicki is studying her lyrics and seeing how they're put together. Listen to the sounds of the words, as well as what she's saying. Learn the style of her best rhymes.


Memorize some of Nicki's best verses. Before you start trying to rap your own rhymes or songs in a Nicki Minaj style, it's good to memorize your favorite verses entirely so you can see how they're put together. Copy them out into a journal or onto your phone, and carry them around with you.
You can check out RapGenius for the lyrics to most of Nicki's songs, or you can check out the lyric sheets in the physical copy of her albums.

, As you gradually learn more and more of the lyrics, lock yourself in your bedroom and start spitting alongside the pink queen herself. As you play the tracks, try to keep up and mimic the way Nicki uses her voices, staying on beat as closely as possible.Try to keep up.


Try rapping them a cappella as well, once you get the hang of rapping along with the track. Try to focus on staying as rhythmic as possible, and not losing track of your Nicki flow.

, One of the unique parts of Nicki Minaj's rap style is her squeaky, giggling, cutesy voice that she goes into to emphasize certain parts of some songs. Her whole persona goes back and forth between cutesy and aggressive, and this voice is an important part of that.


Rap in your normal voice, then pinch your throat and pull your tongue back to rap in the back of your throat, moving your mouth up and down like a ventriloquist dummy. Nicki does this sometimes to get that kind of sound.
She also does a kind of Sorority Girl vocal fry in some of her songs for comic effect. For good examples of this voice, check out her earliest mixtape songs like ""Itty Bitty Piggy.""

, Just like her mentor Lil Wayne will slip into a variety of voices, Nicki's got a bunch at her disposal, including a sudden and funny ""Cookie Monster"" growl.


Sometimes, when performing live, Nicki will just start going into nonsense words, chanting gibberish that sounds pretty awesome on beat. Check out some live clips of her performing ""Starships"" on the Today Show for a good example of this voice style.

, Nicki's got a big voices, so don't try to rap like Nicki if you're going to go to the mic meekly. Work on your roar and rap with lots of confidence in your voice and in your rhymes. Dropping offbeat or flubbing a word is less important than being loud and being aggressive on the mic.


When you're rapping, loudly alternate between your two voices, suddenly. One of the reasons Nicki does that growly funny Cookie Monster voice is to show just how much she doesn't care about your opinion, but she's going to throw it in your face anyway.

, One vocal styling that Nicki Minaj includes in many of her raps in a hard, beat-driven emphasis on the consonants of the words in the songs, like she's trying to nail the words into the ground. It's a hard-stuttering beat that she puts on tracks like ""I Don't Give A"" that make her rhymes stand out. Check out these songs for good examples of her stresses:


""Blazin'""
""Make Me Proud"" w/ Drake
""Up All Night"" w/ Drake
""Beam Me Up Scotty""

, Nicki Minaj will often wander offbeat entirely and just start talking, or growling, or talking trash in a funny voice. It's one of the most unique parts of her personality and one of the reasons people love her music. If you're an aspiring rapper making your own songs, don't be afraid to forget the beat entirely and jump off track to talk some trash. It's all about the heart.


For good examples of this, check out live YouTube videos of Nicki performing her songs. This is something she does more frequently live than on record.

, You don't have to listen to many Nicki tracks before you learn about her biggest subject: The greatest rapper alive, Nicki Minaj. Nicki loves to rap about her greatness on the mic and in the sack, and it's her bragging and boasting that makes us laugh and makes us love her tunes.


Don't be afraid to compare yourself to other rappers in your rhymes. One thing Nicki does constantly is to set up other wack rappers in her songs to knock down. It's a constant in most hip-hop, and Nicki does it as well as the best of them. Don't be afraid to talk some trash.

, Like Young Money compatriot Lil Wayne, Nicki raps using lots of similes, which are comparison statements using the words ""like"" or ""as."" Puns are examples of playing with words that have more than one meaning. Lots of rapper use both of these techniques, but she's a pro.


A good example of a simile is a line like ""I come through, it gets hotter than a soup kitchen / Leave clips in your head like a beautician.""
A good example of a pun is a line like ""You couldn't get a fan if it was hanging from the ceiling.""

, Nicki Minaj didn't get where she is now overnight, and didn't get there based on her looks alone. She got there with some serious hustle, grabbing people's attention on the microphone. If you want to rap like her, you've got to study the craft, devote yourself to hip-hop, and rap all the time.


Put your favorite Nicki tracks on your iPod or on your phone and walk around with them, rapping along silently. When you get back home, leave the track quiet and try to rap it by yourself. Keep practicing until you get it perfect.
Try to find a place you can practice rhyming in quiet, so you can focus on improving. You might want to rush and show your friends as soon as possible, but take the time to make sure you're really good and talented first, so they'll be blown away.

, Rapping is about a lot more than rhyming words. Finding the flow that will work alongside different beats and structuring your rap with the beat is a critical part of being a good rapper. Even if you write great lyrics and do a great Nicki impression, being a Nicki-level rapper isn't possible without flow.


One good way of learning about flow is checking out other rappers versions of a song on free mixtape, or on YouTube. Check out Nicki freestyling over labelmate Lil Wayne's ""A Milli"" to see how her flow differs from his.

, To keep your rhymes organized, start a rhyming journal where you can keep track of good rhyming words, good lines, and start building up your Nicki-style songs.


If you don't want to carry around a bulky journal all the time, keep your notes organized on your phone or some other mobile device for your rhymes. Keep them clearly labeled so you don't have to hunt around for those nasty rhymes you wrote last weekend.
Even if you think of yourself as a freestyle rapper, it's a good idea to keep track of your best rhymes and keep working on them. This doesn't make you a worse freestyle rapper, it makes you a smarter one.

, If you're an aspiring rapper, this is an essential way to get started and eventually building up your ability to freestyle. Many rappers, as they're learning, will keep rhyming lists, with good endings or punch lines to build toward as you rap.


Get a rhyming dictionary, or use rhyming dictionary websites online to help you find rhymes to fill out your best work and give more options.

, It's important to keep moving forward and keep trying. If you want to improve and start rapping like Nicki, start yourself a regular plan of writing three new rhymes every single day, which means about six lines of rapping. Keep yourself on that track as long as possible, and you'll have a new verse every week. It doesn't need to take more than thirty minutes or an hour each day.


At the end of the month, you can go back through and see how many of those verses are worth keeping. Start looking for beats and building your own songs from these rhymes and you'll be on the way.

Listen to Eminem's raps.,
Being aggressive is not the point in Rap, some people think they should start to swear and curse people, but you don’t have to be like that, Eminem swears, but you should be yourself, maybe you want to get at the same speed as him, but you won’t swear.

,
Rapping does not always have to rhyme that is what most people forget, it is better to go at your own speed at your own time, take your time, there is no need to rush, practice and practice, go onto YouTube and type up a good rap song that you like, and practice the song.

,
Entertain people, be funny and know how to wow a crowd, sometimes people do a concert but it ends up boring because they can not entertain people.

,
Have an actual theme to what you are talking about, you don’t want to be talking about rainbows and then suddenly you are talking about how your brother passed away, come up with things that match.

",How to Rap Like Eminem1," If you want to get into the music industry then it's better to know what music you are getting yourself into, listen to rappers and concentrate on what speed they move at and what kind of beats they put into their music.

Think about your topic., It would be wise to start thinking of a good topic to write about.,
Write.,
Title.,
Remember structure.,
Rap it.,
Keep it fun.",How to Write a Cheesy Rap Song," Like all songs, they all are about one or more specific topics. So start brainstorming some good topics and writing them down to view which one(s) you feel most strong about. It is possible to write using more than one topic but for now, we'll just stick to one to stay away from confusion. Some goods examples are: Winnie The Pooh, Star Wars, gross things, your weaknesses, and whatever else you can come up with that you would like to make fun of. Remember, this is a ""CHEESY"" rap song. You want it to be funny and humorous. So try to make fun of the topic you write about.

, Okay, since you've got your topic, now we're going to start the writing process. Based on your topic, you need a title for your song. Why are you writing about that topic? What are some characteristics about it? Also try to make it as funny as possible. Try your best, it doesn't have to be perfect.

, After you've come up with a title, now for the lines of the song. Try to think of the topic's weaknesses and what makes it funny. try to think of things out of the ordinary to spice things up. For example, if the topic was Winnie The Pooh, you could consider writing about him in another life style. Wearing baggy jeans, Air Force Ones, bling, and making it come from HIS point of view, talking about his life being gangsta. This is just an example.

, When writing lines in the rap song, make sure you structure it properly to when it comes time for you to test it out and rap it, the words flow nicely. Kind of to a specific beat. Here's a bad example:


Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Blah Blah
Blah Blah Blah!
See how the words don't add up? If somebody were to rap this song to a beat, it would be not only confusing, but the song wouldn't sound nice or flow steadily. Keep this in mind because it's VERY important.

, After you've written your song successfully, it's time for you to rap it. Depending on what your topic is, try not to rap aggressively and obnoxiously. Try not to sound nervous either. Rapping takes practice so it would be a good idea to go over the song a few times by yourself before you perform it in front of somebody. That way, you don't embarrass yourself and mess up. Use a calm confident voice so the audience won't get bored of you rampaging around flinging your arms and yelling. Also, try not to sound like a robot. Use expression in your voice when rapping. When you listen to your favorite rapper, he uses expression in certain words. It makes the whole song sound a lot better than just sticking to one voice.

, Lastly have fun! And remember, this song is meant to be funny and cheesy. You can also use these steps to write about a serious rap song too.

Drink Water!,
Keep your weight balanced on your feet.,
Keep your neck relaxed and stretch.,
Drink water!,
Watch what you eat and drink.",How to Sing Healthy1," Drinking water is extremely important to singing successfully. However, it's important also to drink water at the correct times relative to when you plan on singing. If you're experiencing phlegm or other issues while you're singing, you should definitely plan to drink water as you sing, but primarily remember to drink about an hour before you plan to sing. This is because water does not go into your vocal chords when you drink it because of the epiglottis, but is secreted when needed from glands in that collect previously drank water. Drinking ahead of time will lubricate your chords as you sing. Weird, but true.;
, Yes, it's probably weird to read about balance in an article about singing, but it's a commonly overlooked necessity to healthy singing. If you have unbalanced weight or are fidgeting as you sing, not only are you going to be forcing your body to do strange things it's not meant to do under a lack of oxygen, but will also look pretty stupid. Sorry, just don't fidget.

, Roll your head around 270 degrees, but do not roll your head backwards to tilt your chin to the ceiling, and anything in that realm. It will stretch out muscles in the front that will encourage your neck to crane when you reach for high notes, which is a habit that too many singers fall into.

, Sorry to mention this again, but it's IMPORTANT. If you don't, you're not going to have lubed up chords and all hell will break loose.

, If you've ever taken voice lessons or done theater, you've probably been told not to eat or drink dairy before a show or performance, which is very true. Dairy creates phlegm and, in case you were wondering, is one of the reasons your voice cracks and makes weird noises when you sing. However, there's something you've probably never been told to avoid before you sing, and that little-known chemical is my little friend ""caffeine."" Yes, it's extremely random, but caffeine tends to dry you out. That explains why things like coffee and Monster can be so addicting- They leave your throat dry and make you thirstier, so you drink more and more until you've had a dysfunctional amount of caffeine and, on top of that, are thirsty.

You can use your unusual voice.",How to Rap Like Eminem2," You may rap lyrics with a manic voice. You can rap fast when you want to impress someone, or you can rap slowly to make people understand what you want to say. You may rap different kinds of rap like: uplifting, funny or depressing songs. You should try to change your tone of voice too. It depends on what kind of songs you are rapping. Eminem uses this method and that's why he is so popular.;
"
"
Rhyming style is very important.",How to Rap Like Eminem3," Eminem has his own style which is well-known all over the world. He often use syllabic raps like: His palms are sweaty, knees weak arms are heavy. And not only one word raps like dog and fog.

Select a suitable opponent.,
Kickoff your battle at the right moment.,
Initiate the battle.,
Open with a hook.,
Rap about your opponent.,
Use your opponent’s rhymes to your advantage.,
Involve bystanders to draw them in.",How to Start a Rap Battle1," Your spontaneous rap battle might fall flat if you challenge an unwilling opponent. Friends that share your interest in rap are a good choice. Musicians and poets, having experience with lyrics and rhyme structure, will also likely be a worthy challenge.


Quick-witted individuals or those who are experienced in public speaking, even if they don’t have an interest in rap, music, or poetry, may surprise with their ability to spit a phrase.;
, Timing is everything. A spur-of-the-moment rap battle can captivate onlookers, but a battle that interrupts conversations or disrupts activities could earn you contempt. Wait for a pause in conversations or activities before initiating your battle.


While waiting for the right moment, pay attention to conversations and things around you. Use these when challenging an opponent to make the transition to a rap battle smooth and natural., Rap battles generally follow a call and response format. One rapper spits rhymes for a designated period of time, then the other. In a spontaneous rap battle, you won’t be able to decide on timing in advance, so your first lines will roughly establish the expected length for each battler.


The typical length for a rap verse is 16 bars. For most songs, this equals about 16 beats of music. For more on counting rhythms, check out this guide.Spit your opening lines to music playing in the background to help keep your sense of timing. Alternatively, play a beat on your phone or have a friend beatbox a rhythm for you.

, Begin with something that catches the attention of your opponent and anyone else close by. Make bold statements. Call out your opponent's ability to spit unrehearsed rhymes. Try to include your challenge in the hook, as in the following example:""You claim you’re a fan, watch rap battles all the time / The gauntlet’s being thrown, son, so spit your best battle rhyme. / Now’s not the time to defer or to whine, to shrug in a sign you don’t mind the sublime chance to climb to the top. / ’Nuff said. You go; I’ll stop.”

, Sometimes called “diss factor,” slamming your opponent’s rhymes, features, and so on is an important part of rap battling. Opening lines that taunt your opponent can bait even unwilling participants to join the battlefield.The way you use diss factor will be unique to your style. Some battle rappers exaggerate features of their opponents, criticize an opponent’s experiences, or remind opponents of previous blunders.The rapper Canibus dissed LL Cool J after being cut from a song by saying, “You walk around showing off your body because it sells / Plus to avoid the fact that you ain’t got skills.”, Listen carefully to your opponent as they rap. Downplay their claims. Reinterpret their words to your own advantage. In the rap world, the technique of turning an opponent’s words back on the opponent is called a “flip.”


For example, if an opponent says, “He says he’s a battler, I find him unfit. / This kid can barely spit.” You might respond, “If you think I’ve barely spit in this dual, / I’d rather barely spit than do like you and drool.”, Address the crowd in your lyrics. Pose rhetorical questions to any onlookers. This will help you connect with your audience, exciting them and winning you cheers. Many impromptu battles are decided by popular opinion, so having the crowd on your side is important.As an example, you might involve the crowd by saying, “Did you hear what she said? / She spits cotton balls, not bullets of lead. / She’s only an underfoot thread, not a poisonous copperhead. / Don’t be misled.”

Practice proper breathing.,
Relax the throat muscles in singing.,
Focus on the mask of the face.,
Inhale your voice.,
Hold the breath in the diaphragm, but you don't really hold the breath, because if you did, no sound would be produced.",How to Sing Genuine Bel Canto," Breathing is essential to proper singing. Generally, we only use about 1/8 of our breathing capacity as we breathe daily. This is not what we want in singing however, as we need a full lung's worth of air, which is the other 7 out of 8.


How do we do this? Imagine that you are breathing into your waist, and through your abdominals, which will expand your diaphragm to the maximum stretch.
If you can place you index finger directly below your rib cage, you can push your belly in, and it pops back out like a balloon, then you are breathing properly for singing.
If your abdominals are rigid, then you are merely pushing out with your belly. You must take a full lung's worth of air.;
, Most singers push with the neck muscles in order to sing high notes. They also do this, naturally because they want their voice to project a long way.


What happens when you push your voice for a period of time, over time your vocal cords adjust to this abuse you are giving them by developing vocal nodules, which are pimples on the inside edges of your vocal cords, which restricts sound and proper vibration of the vocal cords.
You don't need these nodes, so what we need to do is relax the throat when singing. We do this by opening the throat to a yawn. when you yawn, naturally your voice is in its most relaxed position. The mistake when purposely yawning in the back of your throat is to open the mouth wide.
You don't speak with your mouth contorting into an ""o"" position to make the vowel ""o"". Your vowels are created by the tongue position, which naturally happens when you speak, so you shouldn't worry about it too much. What you should do is open the throat by:

Yawning in the back of your throat
Trying to separate your upper back teeth (they won't really move, but try to make them move)
Smiling slightly so that your cheeks lift. This will cause your uvula to lift into the sinus cavities, which proves that you have relaxed the throat completely. Opening the throat also produces a better projection by forcing the voice to resonate off the hard palate.



, This will even out your tone and volume for all of your notes, from your lowest note, to two octaves above.


Generally, the mask is an area in the front of your face that represents an upside down triangle, the point of it in front of you upper lip and narrow, the wide point of it on a level with your cheekbones, behind the eyes. Most people swallow low notes, so what we need to do is aim our low notes forward, on the upper lip and narrow.
Science says that low frequencies are much more quiet than high frequencies. so when we aim the note forward, then we increase its volume, not because the note is louder, but because it now resonates off the hard palate, which is the sounding board of the voice.
Your voice projects well off of your hard palate, so we aim the lower frequency forward and narrow so that people can hear it. We aim our middle notes behind our nostrils, and about as wide as our nose.
The note is aimed further back and wider, because, since it's a higher frequency, it tends to get louder, so therefore, when we aim our middle notes backwards and wider, the volume gets lower.This ensures that all your notes have the same volume and tone quality throughout your two octave range.
We aim our high notes as wide as our cheeks, and behind our eyes, again, for the same reasons as above.

, This is where people need a good imagination and a good will to use it. This next idea is known as inhalation of the voice. People, when they want to sing, exhale their voice, which puts tension on the vocal cords, again, causing nodes.


When you inhale your voice, there is no tension. This is a sensation, and this is what I mean by bel canto can't be taught. It's a sensation. Notice, it was not said ""breath"". You're not inhaling breath, you are inhaling your ""voice"".
Try to inhale the sound, not breath. This is very difficult to explain, and it would be better if you found an instructor who teaches inhalation of the voice. But in truth, when you inhale your voice, you allow your voice to go back into the sinus cavities to resonate as well as the hard palate, which are good projection areas, but also is necessary to create the mixed voice, and this also takes the tension off of your vocal cords.
Remember, this is a sensation, you don't inhale breath into your lungs, and you don""t suck air in to your sinus cavities. You are inhaling sound, not breath.
If you will yourself to do this, you will understand it better.

, Instead, act as if you are holding it in the abdominals. don't force it, but simple do it. This is the simplest step in this technique, and it is to ensure that you use very little air to create sound.

It's important to find drum kits and loops with some extra flair to really make a good beat. There are many producer packs you can download to get a wide range of effective kicks, snares, hi-hats, and claps.;
, Different genres of music have different rules and structures for beats. Most hip hop beats have syncopated kicks and a snare or clap every other bar. Often, closed hi-hats are used to play 16th notes, while open hats are put in the offbeat. This is common for more contemporary sounding beats and is used in a lot of dirty south, crunk, hyphy, and glam rap, but some more older beat uses hat.

, Very few good hip hop or rap beats are made without some form of repetitive loop. Different rap producers use different kinds of instruments and sounds to make effective loops. Timbaland uses a lot of synths and ethnic instruments, while Dr. Dre uses a lot of orchestral hits. Mf Doom uses vintage sounds often from old cartoons. The type of sounds you use to make your track should reflect the general emotions you want that particular track to convey and your own style. Experiment with what sounds best. When you have the sound fonts you want to use, figure out some rhythmic loops and try not to make them too complex or the rapper will have to work harder for the listener's attention. Figure out another simple loop for the chorus that should be catchier then the rest. After a couple verses, try an instrumental bridge, and then go back in for the last few verses.

, This is pretty easy if you've already written your loops. Try to make something that augments the original loop but doesn't compete with it. Well made bass lines are subtle and add to the song rather then just arbitrarily hang in the background.

, Try adding a small amount of reverb to your snare or clap, and a bass boost to the kick. Make sure to use effects in moderation, not to distort the track and make it unlistenable.

, Make sure the beat is loud enough to be heard without overpowering the main melody. The hi-hats should be quieter than the kick and snare. Experiment with the sound levels until you are satisfied with the end result.

Relax.,
Open your throat.,
Try to make sharp, clear, resonant sounds rather than rounded, fuzzy ones that sound nice.,
Make those unbearable noises pleasant.,
Know your limits.",How to Sing Healthy2," Yeah, just... Relax. Singing doesn't work under stress.Nerves? Those are okay, if channeled into positive energy. However, panic attacks? Not so much.

, However, this isn't meant in the way you've probably learned. There's two sets of chords or flaps in your throat- The vocal chords and these other pesky ones that like to get in the way. If you open your mouth and close your throat, your air will be cut off. Now open it- You'll probably feel a light clicking sensation and can breathe almost silently. Congrats, you've retracted! That's a new way to breathe that could just turn around the way you sing.

, Actually, as you start out, you should sound TERRIBLE. However, by making those clear sounds and practicing them, you're training your voice to make unpleasant noises with the right technique. All that's left now is what you could do with just about any teacher- Make those noises more pleasant.

, Don't overexert, but just keep practicing and singing things until you start to sound more desirable. People over-complicate singing, yet simultaneously under-complicate it. You just need to keep exploring.

, This is what causes the demise of many singers. If you feel a sharp fuzzy feeling in your throat or are feeling uncomfortable in any way, STOP! Drink some water and take a break. Also, if you're feeling balls of phlegm coming out of your system or getting lodged in your throat, cough them up rather than swallow them.

Recruit judges for the battle, if necessary.,
Arrange a venue for the event.,
Establish the rules of engagement.,
Organize prizes for winners.,
Advertise for the battle.",How to Start a Rap Battle2," In some cases, you might decide to have the crowd judge the winners. In this case, you won’t need judges. For more serious competitions, judges with a deep understand of rap structure and delivery will be able to more consistently rate and critique battlers.When using a crowd to judge a rap battle, you’ll need a voting system. Have the audience applaud for the battler they think did best. Print out simple ballots so audience members can vote.
Ask local rappers to judge events. Find judges among poetry or hip hop professors at local universities and community colleges. Invite famous rappers who are native to your region to judge the battle.

, The size of your venue will largely determine how large or small your event can be. Contact local schools, libraries, community centers, bars, concert halls, and similar venues to see if you can host your event at places like these.


When finding a venue, verify that there is a microphone or a sound system available. In large spaces especially, it can be difficult to hear battlers without a mic.
If you have already recruited judges for your event, they may be able to advise you on locations suitable for the venue.

, Rap battles held at family friendly locations will likely frown on profanity and harsh language. You may want to restrict some offensive terms and expressions. You’ll also need to decide on the areas battlers will be rated, the number of points for each area, and the time or length allowed for each battler.


Rap is generally divided into three main areas, which can be used for judging battlers. These areas are: content, flow (rhythm, rhyme, and cadence), and delivery.Dissing during a battle can sometimes get out of hand. Some rap battle leagues ban the use of certain kinds of hate speech, like those that involve rape, violation of privacy, or personal harm., Offer to advertise for a local business at your event in exchange for a prize donation. Inquire about potential donations or fundraising opportunities with literature or hip-hop professors at a local university. Hold your own fundraiser.Be sure to specifically mention any prizes in your advertising. This is a great tactic for increasing interest in your event.

, Make and put fliers up at local grocery stores, community centers, and schools. Spread the word on social media and battle rap message boards. Large crowds add excitement to rap battles.Target areas that amateur rappers and live performers frequent, like at bars or clubs that host live music and venues that have hosted rap battles previously.
Invite your family, friends, coworkers, and anyone else you know who is interested in rap or poetry.

Adopt a stage persona.,
Write potential lyrics before the battle.,
Anticipate the attacks of your opponents.,
Add variety to your rhymes.,
Rap using words that start with the same sound.,
Master freestyling.,
Join a local rap battle league.",How to Start a Rap Battle3," This is an effective way to protect yourself from being offended during the battle. Even veteran battle rappers sometimes feel the sting of a well-spoken burn. Come up with a separate identity and practice rapping with this persona. Stay true to this persona on stage.


The persona you adopt will depend on your personality and preferences. You might take on the character of a lighthearted jokester, a sarcastic trash-talker, a gangster from the streets, or others., A pre-thought line can save you if your mind blanks when freestyling. These lines can also buy you time while you think of the right response to something an opponent has said. Prepare more material than necessary.


If you get called out after a strong showing, you may end up needing more material than you planned.At minimum, try to have at least five rounds of lines thought up before battles. A round is generally 16 bars. For most songs, this equals 16 beats., Unless the rules state otherwise, your opponent can use anything against you in a rap battle. This includes your appearance, sense of style, or the subjects you rap about. Identify likely areas that will be used against you and think up counters to these.For example, if you have a large nose, you might deflect this if used against you saying, “He mocks my nose, but ya don’t need a trunk / To smell his crap rhymes and know they’re junk.”
In a rap battle, you should expect your opponent to diss you at some point. Try not to take these too seriously. Focus on your flow, out-spit your opponent, and win the battle.

, Using the same rhyme structure during a rap battle will make your performance repetitive and less interesting. Try out different rhyming structure to see what works best for you.


Rhyme structure is often represented using letters for each line. Same letter lines rhyme, as in the following common rhyme patterns:

A Boy Named Sue rhyme scheme: AABCCB
Ballade rhyme scheme: ABABBCBC
Enclosed rhyme scheme: ABBA
""Fire and Ice"" rhyme scheme: ABAABCBCB, Your lines don’t always have to rhyme. Instead, try creating lines with words that have the same starting sound. This technique is called alliteration. Alliterative lines can also rhyme, as in the following example:""Fans filter the fighters fit for / First place by favorite phrases / I’ll flood your flow like forty days and nights of folklore / Forget fighting, you’ll finish fame-less.""

, Practice coming up with new and interesting raps on the spot. Rap along to ambient music throughout the day to sharpen your skills. Write down catchy lines you come up with so you don’t forget them.


Be persistent with your freestyle practice. It may take some time before you find your flow and can smoothly spit without stopping.
Natural freestyling talent is rare. Don’t feel bad if you stutter or come up with nonsense lines when practicing. Once you can speak fluidly, without pausing, you can work on improving content., The more you practice battle rapping, the more your skills will improve. Local rap battle leagues can be found in many cities. Search for these online with a keyword search for something like “Rap battle leagues near me.” Sign up for battles and perform.


If there aren’t any rap battle leagues nearby, join an online rap battle league. Some online leagues may require a microphone.
Start your own rap battle league with friends and local rappers. Increase your popularity as a battler by posting these videos on social media, like Facebook and YouTube."

As the MC, you'll be the master of ceremonies, the mic-controller, so you'll need to be the most skilled rapper on the stage. Listen to Dirty South rap, listen to New York boom-bap, listen to old-school rap, listen to West Coast gangsta rap, listen to rap you don't even like, and listen to the classics. Get studying, because it's the best homework you'll ever get.


If you have an interest in story-telling, check out Raekwon, DMX, Nas, and Slick Rick for their ability to spin a compelling yarn out of rhymes.
If you like crazy imagery and stream-of-consciousness word play, listen to Ghostface Killah, Aesop Rock, and Lil Wayne for their ability to catch you off guard with strange rhymes and surprises.
If you like hip-hop with great hooks and catchy choruses and unforgettable flow, listen to Rakim, Freddie Gibbs, and Eminem.;
, No one wants to hear recycled rhymes or weak stuff bitten from other rappers, no matter how cool you look or how much swag you've got. The place to start if you want to be a proper MC is working on writing the most creative, unexpected, and catchy rhymes that you possibly can.


Get a rhyming dictionary and revise the rhymes you do write to make them more surprising and exciting. Avoid using clichéd or obvious rhymes to pad out your verses.
Try to write ten new rhymes a day, even if you're not actively working on writing a song. The lines might develop into their own song, or you'll have something to start with when you get a beat you really like and want to jump on.

, Even if you're writing straight-up publishable poetry, if you can't rhyme it to a beat, it won't play. Rappers who can stick to the flow are more likely to succeed than great writers of rhymes.


Get on YouTube and check out other rappers freestyles over beats that you like. On any given hit rap song, there'll be dozens of other rappers doing a freestyle over the beat. It's a good way to study up on the differences in style.

, Spend lots of time with the beats you Try to rap to, letting them seep into your mind before you Try to force awkward rhymes into them. Play with different rhyme schemes and flows in each beat. There's any number of different ways to jump on a beat and you might not jive with every beat you listen to.


Seek out producers who make beats you like and use their rhythms whenever you can. Who knows, it might blossom into a good working relationship.

, The best MCs are adept freestylers, who have the ability to make up unforgettable rhymes straight off the dome. But freestyling isn't a skill that comes from nowhere, you're not born with it. You can learn to develop a cache of rhyme words from which you can deviate, learning to fit in spur-of-the-moment variations on the set patterns that you've developed.


Have a store of one-liners that you work toward. If you've got a good end-line, you can come up with good lines to lead up to it, rather than using your good line as a jumping off point.
Just spit. Stop thinking about what you're doing and start rhyming when you're by yourself. If there's no one around to hear, don't worry about how stupid you sound, or that it doesn't make sense. If you freestyle for five straight minutes without losing the beat, chances are you'll stumble onto at least a couple of great lines you can use later.

, If you're a teenager from the suburbs, it's probably not the best idea to rap about the global cocaine trafficking empire you run. That's not to say you can't stretch the truth some, but it's important to seem real on some level. People have to believe that you're saying things that come from the heart, things that you can stand behind.


Even rappers like Riff-Raff and Die Antwoord, who are often questioned for being some kind of ""joke,"" are serious hustlers who take their craft and their music seriously, using social media and preconceptions about what hip-hop looks like to their advantage. And they can spit.
Music should come first of course, but realness should influence your look to. Cultivate a fresh look that people will gravitate toward, one that represents your music visually. Look cool.

, If you don't have anything to say or add to hip-hop, it'll be hard to get anyone to listen to your songs. You don't have to be Shakespeare, but you do have to be able to craft a catchy hip-hop song that will stick in someone's mind, combining words and sounds that people will want to listen to.


Listen to lots of rap and find the gaps. Talk about the angles in popular topics other rappers don't talk about. Go where other rappers are afraid to go. Explore uncharted territory.
Rap about where you come from and reference local things. Even though he's mostly rapping about traditional gangsta rap tropes, Freddie Gibbs is unique because he's a technically flawless rapper who raps about Gary, IN, an unexpected and unique place to set a rap song. It makes him and his music unique.

, As the MC, you'll be the master of ceremonies, the controllers of the mic, and probably the most skilled rapper of the bunch, but to make yourself really stand out, you'll need some help. Aside from your own skills, you'll also need:



A DJ who knows how to scratch, mix, and perform. To back you instrumentally, find someone who digs your music and is skilled on the wheels of steel, someone who knows how to hold it down while you perform. It's also a good idea to find someone who's already got all the gear necessary for performing DJ sets live. Go hear some local guys spin on DJ nights and see who catches you ear.

A hype-man. Typically, a hype-man is someone who backs you up on the end-rhymes of your songs, adding another layer of texture and volume to your songs. Check out live videos of the Beastie Boys to see how the others come in on the rhyming words to emphasize the song, or how Flavor Flav rocks the stage in early Public Enemy tracks. They're not the main rappers, but a good hype man has stage presence and charisma that makes for a great performance.

Complementary MC's. The Wu-Tang Clan was built around the idea that one talented MC was great, but eight would be even greater, especially if unique and unpredictable styles and flows were all included on the same track. Find other rappers who have slightly different styles or personalities to collaborate with in your performances, giving you each an extra element to play off of.

, As the MC, you're the main attraction. You have to own the stage and get people excited about the show. The DJ's got to keep the beat moving and the hype-man is there to back you up, so the pressure's on.


Banter with the audience to get them invested. Cue the DJ to drop the beat and let people sing along once you've coached them on the chorus.
If you want people to be into the music, you've got to be into it to. Move around, feel the beat, and look like you're excited to be on stage. If you stand stock-still at the mic stand and look like you're bored, people will look the same way in the crowd.

, If you're well prepared, you should feel confident in your abilities and in your music, so you can throw yourself into putting on the best possible show you can for the people. It's time to shine. Give them a performance they'll never forget.Make sure you've got all your lyrics memorized and have practiced using the mic so you can be confident that all the technical aspects of the performance are going to go off without a hitch. It's hard to perform with confidence if you're trying to remember all the words.
It's always important to do a mic check before performing. Part of the work of performance is being there before the show to make sure everything is set up and working as planned. Don't be a fake rock star and blow off the pre-show responsibilities. Be a professional.
Always go on stage sober and well-rested. Save the partying for after the show.

, It'll be hard to get into your music if you're mush mouthed, too quiet, or muddy in the mix. Rap shouldn't sound like one of the adults from old Peanuts cartoons. Put your vocals up front and make sure it's loud enough to be heard from all corners of the room.


If you have trouble keeping your voice up while you perform, practice reading magazines and books out loud to get your voice naturally into a louder register. It might annoy your roommates, but it'll be worth it to amp up your performance to where it needs to be.

, Both at your shows and online, be active about interacting with your growing fanbase. The MC will be the face of the crew, so you need to take the publicity side of the rap game seriously. Stay out after your gigs to meet people and sell any merch that you have, being friendly and available.


Encourage people to come out to the gigs on social media and respond to people personally on Twitter and Facebook. Rappers, maybe more so than any other group of musicians, are known for taking control of their social media and working it to its fullest potential. You're just as likely to get signed to a record deal from a popular YouTube video as a successful mixtape.

Start freestyle rapping.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Stop thinking so hard.",How to Have Rap Battles With Your Friends1," A no-brainer, huh? Freestyle rapping is not a topic you approach on a Wednesday afternoon after a round of Zelda with your friends. It has to be something you've invested time into. Listen to plenty of hip hop and bust out that rhyming dictionary -- you don't want to get schooled, do you?


Listen for rhythms. You can find them anywhere and everywhere. Take a ticking clock or a cappuccino machine. Hear that downbeat? Now put words to it. The clock is ticking / my mind is on the chicken / that's because it's so freakin' finger lickin' / good. Maybe you can do better.
Start writing. Though freestyle and rehearsed rapping are two very different skills, they share the same core abilities. If you can't rhyme, you can't do either. If you can't handle pressure, you can't do either. If you can't open your mind, you can't do either. Writing will home in on those core skills you need to build into freestyling.;
, The only way you'll improve your skills in the battle arena is if you build up your prowess beforehand. While you're fixing your hair in the mirror, rap battle your reflection. While you're jamming out to your favorite song, think of how you'd add to it. Could you make it better? Constantly stay in the zone.


Start simple. Think Dr. Seuss simple. It may seem unnecessary, but it'll prime your brain for the real deal. Once you master that, start constantly thinking of rhymes. “I’m colder than a Dairy Queen Blizzard.” What's next?

That's right. This is Lord of the Rings; you're the hobbit, I'm the wizard.



Just go with it. Whatever you do, just go with it. I'm sittin' at Panera / man I hate this era / of technology, hypocrisy / but man I dig this smoothie. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to have things come out of your mouth that you really just wish would've stayed in there. Don't let it show. Never let them know you regret what you said.

, Go with the flow. Let it come to you like inspiration in the night. Writing is a great aid in learning how to go on autopilot. Once you stop trying to make sense, you'll start letting the creativity and imagery flow.


Pick a topic. It could be something as simple as brushing your teeth or the table in front of you. Set your mind on something and press the proverbial ""go"" button. Soon you'll find what topics are easier and what ones are harder -- so when you get into battle, you'll know what to stick to and what to avoid.

Avoid voice damaging substances.",How to Rap Extremely Fast," As a rapper, your instrument is your voice. If you don't warm up your instrument beforehand, you could hurt your voice or end up rapping less impressively than you want. Some ways you can warm up your voice include:


Massaging your jaw to release tension. Tension in your jaw can have a negative effect on your tone. Take the heel of your hand and, starting below your cheekbone and moving toward your chin, rub with moderate pressure in small circles.
Trilling with your lips. Vibrate your lips together with a ""h"" sound, like a horse nickering, to get your lip muscles ready to spit some sick lyrical rap. Repeat this exercise with a ""b"" sound, as though imitating a boat sound.
Buzzing like a kazoo. Vibrate your lips together and ascend to the upper reaches of your vocal range in a controlled fashion. When you've reached your upper limit, kazoo down to your lower range in the same fashion. Repeat this several times.;
, Many rappers look at using pre-made material when freestyling as bad form. However, by writing down material in your free time, you'll train your mind to come up with rhymes on the fly more easily. Come up with lists of words that you find significant and interesting rhyme combinations. You might even want to carry a notebook and pen around with you to jot down ideas as they occur to you.


Experiment with different kinds of rhymes. Traditionally, rhyme structure looks at the sounds shared between two words, but you could make use of near rhymes or rhyme one word with a two word compound. For example, the word ""orange"" forms a near rhyme with the compound ""door hinge.""Use internal rhymes, like Edgar Allen Poe's classic poem, The Raven. To take an example of this from the beginning of The Raven, ""Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary...""
Seek out rich rhymes. These are often overlooked due to the fact that although they sound similar, they are written differently. Some examples include the pairs: raise-raze, blew-blue, guest-guessed, and so on., Diction is how clearly you speak or pronounce words, and when rapping quickly, good diction is very important if you want people to understand the words you are saying. There are many ways you can practice diction. Many vocalists, actors, and TV personalities will warm up their mouths by saying tongue twisters.


Another technique you can make use of to improve diction forces your mouth to speak clearly around an obstruction, like marbles, ice cubes, or a cork. In this exercise, you should hold a cork between your lips or a smaller object, like marbles or ice cubes, inside your mouth while speaking. Try to speak clearly around the object to train precision in speaking.
You might find that your rapping (and speaking) abilities improve if you practice your diction at the start of every day. While getting your day started, say a few of your favorite tongue twisters to yourself.
Try to add variety to your diction routine. You might alternate fast and slow speeds every other line, you might over pronounce and exaggerate each word, or you could try saying it in a whisper., Poor breathing technique could leave you gasping into the mic after spitting some righteous rhyme. This can distract listeners from your message or your clever use of words. You'll have better tone and support for your voice if you breathe from your diaphragm, which is a band of muscle below your lungs.


When your diaphragm is engaged, it pulls down allowing your lungs to draw in air. When it pushes up, the air is forces from your lungs. You should feel the area between the bottom of your rib cage and your bellybutton extend outward slightly when breathing from your diaphragm correctly., Reading out loud can help you speak more smoothly and will improve stuttering, stammering, and getting tongue tied. Reading out loud can also help you speak faster, which will translate to faster rapping ability.Because of the fact that rap is a spoken form of music that still maintains rhythm, you should consider reading poetry out loud, as poetry often has strong rhythmic decisions, which also might help you gain a better sense for the flow of language.To improve your abilities and identify areas you could improve, you should read/recite poetry, speeches, or segments from books in front of others. This way you can get feedback on your delivery, rhythm, and also get encouragement about the things you did well.

, This is an important part of your improving your rap skills. When rapping, you might get caught up in the moment or in the flow of what you are saying, which might make it hard to identify trouble spots or strong points. You might find you struggle with a certain word, or a certain sound. If you know you have this problem, you can drill saying it so you don't make a mistake when you're rapping onstage.


If you have an especially good recording, or if you have a specific issue you're not sure about, let a trusted friend or relative listen to your recording to get feedback. Some people naturally have a better ear than others for speech. Use others as a resource to improve., You'll be more passionate if you're rapping about something important to you. This, in turn, will lead you to being more productive in your rapping.You don't have to only rap about your message, whatever that may be. But you can tap into those strong feelings to rap about topics you don't care much about with a fire that listeners will recognize.


Examine your values to help understand what your message is. What are the things most important to you? What do you hate and want to change? These questions will help guide you in finding out your message.
Look through past raps you've written or reflect on freestyling you've done in the past. Do you notice any themes that occur over and over again? These might also indicate a message or theme that is important to you.

, The styles of your favorite artists can act as a lens through which you focus and discover your own style. Repeating your favorite lyrics can help improve your diction. Writing your own rap that follows the same pattern of your favorite rappers, too, can help you produce material and hone your rap sense., Tension can lead to you getting tongue tied or going blank. Take a few breaths, have a drink of water before you go on stage, and don't rush yourself. Even if you want to imitate your favorite blazing-fast rapper, everyone has to learn to walk before they run - that means you'll have to start slower and work your way up to a faster speed.


Try to distract yourself from the people and the performance. Focus on your message, on what you are going to say, and on the importance and enjoyment you get from rapping. Use these positive things to overcome your nerves.
You might benefit from moving around a bit on the stage, if you have a mic that'll allow you to do so. When you become nervous, it's natural to freeze up and feel like you're paralyzed. Fight that feeling by moving around, using gestures, and engaging your body., Muscular tension can cause your jaw to clench, which can make you harder to understand when rapping.Muscle tension can also lead to trembling or discomfort, which could effect your stage presence. Mental relaxation techniques can help calm your body and release tension in your muscles.


Progressive muscular relaxation is a 15 minute technique that could also help with pre-performance tension. First, moderately tense specific muscle groups, like your neck, shoulders, arms, and legs. After five seconds of tensing each muscle group, release the tension and exhale as you do., Even professionals make mistakes sometimes when performing live. The trick is to not let that small mistake ruin the rest of your performance. Stopping immediately whenever you make a mistake and going back to the beginning will train your mind to unnaturally break phrases up. Instead, when you are practicing, finish the phrase and then go back and correct your error, speaking the whole phrase fluidly and without interruption. This will help you speak through mistakes made in live performances.A hallmark of talented freestylers is making errors part of the rap. Rapper Eminem is an excellent example when he said, ""I take a beat and loop it, / I take a beat and shoop it, / Shoop it? What does that mean? / I don’t know but I got fat jeans on, / And I already said that, / I don’t know where my head’s at..."", Seek out local rap competitions. Participate in ciphers where two or more rappers trade off speaking verses.Only by performing regularly can you develop your stage presence, slay the demon of stage fright, and become at home where you belong - on the stage.Onstage performances will also help you train your ability to think quick on your feet in front of people.


Try to walk into your first performances with the perspective that it will be a learning experience. No one expects to be a master of something on their first try, and in this same way, you shouldn't expect yourself to be perfect your first time on stage.

, Warm tea has long been a remedy for sore throats, but it can also help keep your voice from becoming strained in the short term or damaged in the long term. Liquids that are too hot can be bad for your throat, and drinking liquids that are too cold before performing can hurt your vocal.


Poor hydration can lead to permanent damage in your vocal folds. If you plan on rapping professionally, you should take frequent water breaks to protect your voice.
Licorice and peppermint teas are recommended for your voice. Peppermint tea will cut down on gnarly phlegm that give your voice a garbled tone, and licorice tea will numb and sooth your throat, which is excellent if you have to perform night after night., You should avoid sprays that numb your throat. These can lead to you pushing your voice too hard, which can result in permanent damage.However there are some hydrating brands, like Entertainer's Secret and Vocalise, which should be available at your local drug store.Keep one of these products handy and use it regularly when practicing and performing.

, Your voice is just like any other muscle, and using it too much or pushing it too hard can lead to serious trouble. This could be something as simple as hoarseness or voice loss, which can usually be remedied by resting your voice until it returns to normal. But this can prevent you from going on stage, recording, or practicing!


It's better to take a few short breaks than lose an entire day of practice/performing because you need to rest your voice. If you feel tightness, pain, or a change in your quality of voice, it's likely a sign that you need to take a break., Even when you're getting fired up and you really want to tear loose with your voice, you should avoid yelling or screaming. This can tire out your voice or even cause it damage.Instead, use mic techniques to imitate yelling and screaming without doing harm to your voice.

, Smoking tobacco will cause damage to your vocal folds over time and drinking alcohol will dehydrate your vocal folds, making them more prone to damage and strain. Avoid food that causes heartburn. Over time, the stomach acid from causing your heartburn could also harm your voice."
