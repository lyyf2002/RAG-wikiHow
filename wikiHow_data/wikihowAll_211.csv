Listen to underground rappers and their flow.,
Find a beat that suits your style.,
Get a composition notebook.,
Get computer recording software such as Audacity.,
Record your first song over the beat you chose with the rhymes you wrote or freestyle.,
Record more songs and put on a CD.,
Find a rap name for yourself.",How to Make an Underground Rap Song," Study their bar structure and create your own.;
, It's suggested to omit Southern crunk out of the rap genre, as it has a corny style to it and won't really match well.

, These types of notebooks hold pages well and last longer than regular style notebooks.

, A mic dynamic mics are good if you have a preamp and mixer to go with it. You can also get a USB condenser mic, such as an Audio Technica At2020 USB condenser; this is a budget conscious choice.

, Over dubbing is important if you want words to stick out. This is done by making 3 or 2 voice overs, over your original recording and panning out each track making it sound full. Be careful with distorting.

, Distribute your CDs while promoting and get support from friends.

, Be original and get more respect. The more generic names start out with ""Lil'"", ""Killa"", and ""Big"".

Write for your genre.,
Stay simple.,
Loop the beat.,
Have a constant sound.,
Have a ""melody"".,
Add effects.,
Don't clutter your beat.",How to Make a Beat1," Every music genre has its own rules regarding beats. Know what you're writing for and how those beats are usually structured. This is what gives a particular type of music its ""sound"".;
, Start off with something very basic: four beats per measure (a sort of musical sentence), and eight measures long. This will give you a reasonable structure to start with.

, When the beat gets to the end of eight measures, it should be able to loop back to the beginning and sound okay. For a beginner there are two ways to do this:


Have very short, identical beat sections (da da da DA! da da da DA! etc.).






Have a general section which builds in the final measure and crashes back down to the basic beat of the first measure (think that drummer hitting all of his drums really fast before going back to a normal beat).







, This will provide the main ""beat"" for your loop. Think of it as the baseline for your beat. A note on every fourth beat should do the trick.

, This will be the more noticeable drumming beat. You will need to come up with a pattern for this, usually by messing around (sorry, even the pros have to mess around until they find something that sounds good).

, Once you've got a basic structure from the bass line and the melody, you can add in effects. These are occasional instruments which add just a little flavor to your beat.

, Don't add in like forty instruments. This will just make your beat sound way too busy. Remember: the beat is only background noise to make the real music sound better. You want to feature your song, not the beat.

Challenge your friend(s) to a freestyle rap battle at the venue of your choosing.,
Have a rap battle with one friend, or a few friends.,
Have someone beatbox for you.",How to Have Rap Battles With Your Friends2," If there's a hip hop club in your area, you'll have to sign up. Tell him/them you will sign everyone up. Make sure that you do not tell him what you are going to say in your rap routine! It's an improvisation anyway. Odds are you'll only be able to prepare in theory.


You can do it wherever you'd like, so long as you're not disturbing the peace. Right after school gets dismissed in the parking lot is a great idea if you want your battle to wind up on lots of cell phones or on YouTube.
You may want to have your first couple of rap battles in the privacy of your own home. There's no shame in warming up. None of your peers have to know that you guys have been rehearsing for this moment.

, The only things you'll need are two people, a judge, and possibly some microphones or a quiet enough area. Decide a point system, such as best of three.


Set a time limit for each round and a set number of rounds. What's more, decide who has to go first. It can be the loser of the previous week or find an unbiased way, like coin flipping.

Going first isn't all bad. You get to cover your bases. If you know your pants are too baggy and your grades in math aren't exactly stellar, talk about it. That way your opponent won't be able to attack you as easily.



, If that's not an option, find a loop to play in the background. Take turns rapping insults at each other and generally showing off your creative, improv skills. Make it a rule that the judge will then name the winner of each round based on quality of insult and rap skill. Whoever gets the most points, wins.


What's the prize? Apart from ultimate respect, of course.

Open a new blank ""Hip Hop"" canvas in Logic.,

Find a song that you'd like to sample.,Download the song or do whatever you can to make the song your own mp3 file.,
Drag the file from wherever it is into the empty track that you've created on Logic.,
Convert your section(s) into a sampler track if you want to.,
Control the samples you've just created with your keyboard.,


,


,
Change sounds.,
See what effects you want.,
Layer your tracks.,
Hit hard in an artistic way.,
Experiment and try not to make your beat sound generic.",How to Make Beats Like Kanye West," On your left you should see a library of sounds, volume and mastering control to the right of that. To the right of the volume is some preset sounds that are given to you whenever you open a ""Hip Hop"" canvas. On top of the list of sounds you were given, there is a plus sign. Click this plus sign to make a new track. Logic will ask what type of track you wish to open, press ""Audio.""
, Usually with Kanye West, the sample is the base of the entire instrumental, its all about which part of the song you wish to sample and in which ways you flip the chopped samples into your own melodies. The second strong part of Kanye's production is the drums which are just as important. These are the main factors.,, Find where you want to sample and convert it into its own sampler track. You can either cut the audio section that you want out by using the scissor tool or you can find the tempo of the entire song and cut it into equal sized slices depending on the space between each slice. #*Choose the space between each cut by cutting the first section at a certain location and holding the ""option"" button on your macbook as you click the pad. If there's only one section of the song you want you can cut that out just by using the scissor and the pad alone and then converting it into a sampler track.

, They must all be highlighted and then at the top of your screen go to ""Track"" and click ""Convert to new sampler track."" Choose how many keys you want to use to control the samples and then click okay., On the left side of your canvas there are three section, the library, the mixer, and list of sounds that Logic has already chosen. In the mixer section you can add effects to your sample. Above the volumes will show the effects you've chosen. Right now that entire section is empty (it's labeled ""Audio FX"") because you haven't added any effects to your sample cuts. Kanye is known for his distorted drums and his high pitched sampled, those are only two of the many effects you may use in Logic.,,, Logic Pro X comes equipped with hundreds of thinks you can do to sounds. Kanye West does not always add effects to his samples but sometimes he does. Being that this is not a tutorial on mastering and mixing the beat but simply putting it together like Kanye West would, there won't be a description for each effect and the hundreds and even thousands of things you can do to samples and any sounds on this program. Think outside the box when messing with effects and sample melodies, remember that the possibilities are endless and that there are no limits., Before pressing record and layering the track's samples into songs, you must first . Kanye's signature effect was the high pitch vocals in his samples. So he would take sample cuts of songs where there were vocals of the singer, and then bring the pitch up to a squeaky mouse-like pitch that actually sounds pretty cool. To do this you must make sure your track of samples is highlighted and then go to the effects section above the volumes. Click on an empty space and a menu will appear. these are the effect titles and each option has a list of effects you can use. For distortion on your choice of drums, just go to the ""Distortion"" option and chose any type of distortion you like, and then experiment with the settings to get the exact amount of distortion that you want. You can also add distortion to your sample. Kanye West has done that before. For pitch altering, you go to the ""Pitch"" option and click on the pitch options. For a high pitch like Kanye West, just click on pitch shifter and turn the mix that is at 25% all the way up to 100% and you should hear the change instantly., There is no limit to the amount of drums you can have in each track, nor is there a limit on the amount of tracks you can create, you can make as many drum patters and sample patterns as you want. It's best to play with your samples first and get a groove. After you decided your melody, and made your tempo (most of Kanye's beats are around 80-100 BPM) press ""R"" on your keyboard and record your melody, this may take a while and some practice but when you get the melody down, double click on it and the piano roll will show and you can perfect the pattern down there.

The colors of the lines are based on how hard you pressed down on your USB piano keyboard keys. If you think you pressed too hard or too soft during your recording of your pattern you can edit the velocity on the meter to the left of the piano roll entitled ""Velocity."" Record as many sample tracks and patterns as you want, you can have samples on top of each other or you can have different sample patterns for different sections of your beat.

, When it comes to drums Kanye West is very aggressive, tribal, digital, and creative. So they have to hit hard in an artistic way if you want them to sound how Kanye West would like them. Which patterns are the verse and the hook of the beat are completely up to you. Now, all that's left after you have all your sample and drum patterns figured and you know where you want to put each patter, you just have to get it there. #*Verses for hip hop beats are usually about 16 bars and you can read how long your bar patterns are using the numbers at the top of the Logic pro X canvas.

The hooks to songs are about 8 bars. They usually repeat the 8 bar hook and 16 bar verse pattern about two or three times. It is suggested that you record an intro pattern, bring your drums in for the 8 bar hook, and then change to another pattern for the 16 bar verse and repeat that two or three times or whichever sounds best to you.

, Kanye West is very innovative so there is never a right way to end a creative beat. Use affects, time your transitions well and do things that are polarizing. Browse through sounds and remember that there are no rules to music production. If you need any musical guidance it is suggested that you listen to Kanye West's entire discography. Have fun!"

Use a high-hat.,
Use a kick.,
Add effects.,
Balance the levels.",How to Make a Beat2," This is good for that basic beat.

, A kick drum or a tom can make a nice melody. Snares can also be good for this, but work better in rock than in, say, hip hop. Experiment to find out what you think sounds best.

, Rims, crashes, snares, as well as effects like reverb, claps, and bass can add a little more depth to a basic drum beat.

, You want to master the track when it's done, to make sure that none of the instruments are too loud or distracting and that everything sounds great.

Use a free online program.,
Use an app.,
Get a free sound program.,
Get professional software.",How to Make a Beat3," If you just need a quick beat for recording a video for Youtube or something like that, you can use a free Javascript program. There are a number of these online, which will allow you to create a basic beat.

, If you're wanting something cheap but a little more powerful, there are a number of apps for Android or iOS that you can use. These may cost only a dollar or two, or be free altogether. Try to get one which exports mp3s.

, There are sound softwares, like Audacity, which are high quality but free. These take a little more work, training, and skill, since you will have to engineer the audio yourself.


Audacity, for example, will require you to have sound samples and to stitch them together yourself, but the final product can sound much more professional and you'll have a lot more control.







, There are professional sound programs which you can use if you're serious about making music. These are very expensive, usually several hundred dollars, but they are what the pros use and what pros will expect. You will need a great sample library to go along with these programs.

Set up a metronome or click track to get the beat started.,
Build the drum beat before anything else, meshing it to the click track.,
Use the bass line to set a melody to the percussion.,
Add in melody instruments, sounds, and lead lines.,
Practice using seamless loops to extend your song out.,
Mix up the song with a ""new"" beat in the intros, outros, and/or middle.,
Think about tension, energy, and space when building beats.",How to Make Beats1," This will typically be a separate track in your software. Depending on how fast or slow you want the song to be, the speed of the click can be divided into halves, thirds, or quarters. You can experiment if you’re unsure.The click track will help to ensure that with all of the copy and pasting you’ll do, the song stays on tempo.
Your tempo will vary according to the mood and style of the song, and is typically between 80 and 120.
More likely than not, you'll turn the click track off once you have a basic beat made -- this is just a guide right now to keep you on tempo.;
, The drums are your backbone, providing the structure that all other instruments fall on. They usually come first. That said, you don't have to use drums for percussion -- gunshots, car doors slamming, synth blasts, pots and pans, and much more have been used to provide rhythm in songs of all genres.


Hip-hop beats have a classic trio -- kick drum, snare, and hi-hat. That's it. Check out DJ Premier's famous beats on the album Step in the Arena for a classic example.You can download drum packs, which are recordings of different percussion sounds, to use in your songs for free online. Search the drums you want on a search engine, like ""Steel Drum Sounds Pack,"" or ""Led Zeppelin Drum Sample Pack.""

, Together, the bass and drums form the rhythm section of every song. While the drums set the tempo and beat, the bass locks into this rhythm and hints at the melody, often with simple, danceable lines. There are many songs that are almost all drums and bass -- so don't disregard the bass because it is harder to hear in the final mix -- it's the instrument that gets people dancing.


Bass lines can be a simple, like Nas' ""Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),"" or complex, like Common's ""Be (Intro).""
A bass line doesn't need a bass guitar, though they help. Listen to what Daft Punk is able to do with deep synthesizers for another example.
Your bass line and kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) should mesh for the maximum effect. Most producers like to have them alternating., The bass and the drums should be unique to make your song unique. Still, the melody line is where most songs come to their own and become new, big beats. Build melodies around your mood, using synths and electronic sounds for EDM or techno music, horns and guitars for R&B, even odd ""found sounds"" from weird sources (see ""Windows Media Player"" by Charles Hamilton for an example). The possibilities are endless.


Play around with sounds constantly-- the only way to find out what sounds best is to try out as many different orchestrations as possible. , Looping is taking at least one bar of music, like a drum line, and repeating it flawlessly so it sounds like the drummer is playing the exact same thing the whole song. You can, and should, loop everything -- making the perfect smaller section and then dragging it out to save time and get the perfect tempo for your entire beat.


Great loops don't feel like loops -- they perfectly come back around so it sounds like a real musician is playing the instrument over and over again., A straight beat is great. But most songs are made up of several related beats, each coming together to provide excitement and movement. The new beats, however, are almost always closely related. Some ideas for breakdowns and changes include:



Add a new melody line: A new sample, some brief vocals, or the re-emerging melody line usually signals a ""chorus"" or sing-along section of the beat. This is usually the most memorable part of the beat.

Drop to a minimal beat: Dropping to just drums and bass, or even just drums, is a great way to lower the energy. You can then blast the beat back to pump the song back up and get the crowd really moving.

Building and dropping: Add volume, new instruments, and drums to grow tension and energy, then drop out to a big, bassy, and danceable section.

, These are more nebulous concepts of music composition, and every producer has different preferences. No matter what you choose, think about these three concepts to make interesting, layered beats.



Tension: Found in juxtaposition, tension is what pulls the song forward. It is the difference between the intense moment before a ""drop"" in dubstep and the cathartic, slower boom after the drop -- this difference creates tension, which creates greater songs.

Energy: What is the tempo of the song? How does it change or evolve, and does it bring the crowd with it? Some songs need full energy the entire time, plowing ahead. Others songs benefit from slow builds, changes, and swings in energy.

Space: What is the beat for? If it is for a rapper, you best leave some moments of near ""silence"" so that they can get the words out. Think of how ""full"" your ears feel -- sometimes simpler is good, allowing one instrument to shine. Sometimes you need all 30 tracks at once.

Establish good technique.,
Perfect your breathing.,
Warm up your voice.,
Accept your limitations.,
Remember to keep your larynx relaxed and low.,
Avoid techniques to control the larynx itself.,
Begin by feeling your voice box.,
Sing a few different notes with your hand still in place.,
Try to sing without raising your larynx.,
Massage your throat.,
Determine the bottom of your vocal range.,
Start slowly.,
Perfect the note before moving on.",How to Sing Deeper," Vocalists typically spend years training to perfect their skill. Do your best to master your current vocal range before attempting to expand it.


Whenever possible, work with a professional vocal coach to help guide you. Vocal coaches are experienced teachers who are likely to pinpoint the exact ways in which you can improve.Vocal coaches can also teach you methods of protecting your voice and steer you away from damaging techniques. This is especially important if you are attempting to add to your vocal range, as you will be purposefully testing your limits.;
, Vocalists must strike a balance in their breathing. A too-shallow breath will prevent a singer from holding a note, while breathing too deeply can cause tension and strain.This added tension can reduce your vocal range.


Regular aerobic exercise will increase your lung capacity, which is a benefit for any vocalist.Pre-performance light aerobic exercise has also been shown to positively impact the efficiency of vocal warm-ups., Before singing, always make sure to warm up first. A good vocal warm up will release tension and prepare your voice to use its full vocal range.


Take a few breaths. Keep your posture upright with your shoulders and chest low and relax. Breathe normally and focus your attention on the muscles of your chest, neck, and shoulders. Are any of these tense? Keep breathing and focus on relaxing these muscles.
Practice your scales. Sing a few notes, starting in a low pitch and ending in a high one. Do the same, only from high to low this time. Do this with a few different sounds (such as ""oo,"" ""me,"" and ""e"").
Make a ""kazoo"" buzz. Round your lips, inhale, and then exhale while making a ""woo"" sound at a single pitch. There should be a slight buzzing. Do a few scales like this., While there are steps you can take to train your voice, there is a practical limit to how low you can get your voice to go. Your vocal range is determined by your unique anatomy, and it isn't something you can change. If you are naturally a tenor, you will probably not be able to reach the lowest notes that a bass singer can. Instead of attempting the impossible, work with the range you have.Keep in mind that your range is mostly determined by the length of your vocal cords, which usually correlates with the length of your neck. The longer your vocal cords, the deeper your voice will go. Men tend to have larger vocal cords compared to women. For that reason, men usually have lower singing voices., The larynx naturally dips when we inhale. Maintaining this lowered position is a major component of what some vocalists call singing with an ""open throat.""


Relaxing your larynx will help you to utilize your full low range potential. Many inexperienced vocalists sing with a raised larynx. This produces a much higher, softer sound lacking depth.
The second major aspect of an ""open throat"" is a lifted soft palate. However, this action is largely important for singing higher notes rather than low ones.The larynx is also colloquially known as the voice box. It is a complex organ that regulates the tension of your vocal cords and consequently the sound of your voice. The Adam's apple, a structure clearly visible on the throat of most men and some women, is part of the larynx., While a longer (or ""dropped"") larynx will produce a slightly deeper sound, exercising direct control of your larynx will damage your voice. Forcing an unnaturally low (or ""depressed"") larynx is not advised.Instead, you will work to control and relieve tension in the muscles surrounding it.


Another common mistake is using the tongue to push down on the voice box. While this will technically lower your larynx, it will actually cause the muscles in your throat to tighten, damaging your voice's sound and range.Remember that the ideal open throat should be free of tension.If you ever find yourself straining, reevaluate your technique.

, Gently place your hand over it. If you can't see your larynx, feel for a slight bump on the front of your throat right under your jaw. Make sure your fingers are only lightly touching your larynx without exerting pressure on it.

, Pay attention to any changes in position your larynx may make. Is it moving up with your higher notes?


If you feel your larynx slightly tilt or pivot, rather than move upwards, then you already have this technique mastered. Your larynx must move slightly for your voice to change pitch.
Never hold your larynx in place with your hand. This technique can cause bruising and seriously damage your voice., The position of your larynx can be seen as a barometer for spotting tension in your throat. Keeping these muscles relaxed is key for vocal quality in general and is especially important for achieving deeper notes.


If you're having trouble keeping your larynx low, try deep breathing exercises.Slowly inhale and exhale while feeling your larynx with your hand. When your larynx is low during inhalation, pay attention to which muscles in your throat and jaw relax. Try to replicate this when singing.
This may take some time to master properly, especially if you're new to singing. Don't get discouraged if you can't do it right away.

, The only way for you to effectively keep your larynx low is to relax its associated muscles. If you're having trouble maintaining a low larynx, try using either your fingers or an electric massager to gently work over your throat.


Press your fingers or massager down firmly but without force. Gently move your fingers from side to side.
Start at your hyoid bone, which is located between your chin and larynx. Massage this area and the muscles surrounding it.
Massage your larynx using your hands and breathing exercises. Place the backs of your hands on either side of your larynx and gently move it from side to side. Then, use the back of your hand to hold it to the right and take a few slow, deep breaths through your nose. Do the same with your larynx held to the left., In order to safely learn to sing lower notes, you will first need to find the lowest note you can currently sing. Either use a pre-recorded tool online or have a partner play notes on a piano. Starting from C4, try to sing that note. Work your way down until you reach a note you either cannot match at all or that you strain to sing. The previous note is the bottom of your current range.Because it can be difficult to judge our own voices accurately, it is especially helpful to have a vocal coach or someone else with musical training for this step.

, Try your best to work on just the next lowest note after the bottom of your vocal range. Practice with a scale that includes just a few other notes along with the one you're working on. Perform these scales daily for roughly half an hour. Stop the exercise if your voice begins to strain.For example, if C2 is the lowest note you have currently mastered, try singing B1 next.

, Before going to the next lower note, it's important that you can consistently hit your new note. If you can't comfortably sing one note lower, you will not be able to perform the note below it.


If you're finding that your voice breaks frequently during these exercises, you will likely benefit from revisiting a higher note and working on that one first."

Listen to your favorite producers with an ear to steal their tricks.,
Learn to play another instrument or learn music theory.,
Experiment, play, and break all the rules when making beats.",How to Make Beats2," You don't always have to write out every melody or drum line by yourself. Find a portion of another song that stands out to you and incorporate it into your own music. It is usually difficult to sample a song with drums, so this part of the beat will be added later. Once you’ve loaded the sample into your hard drive, heighten or lower it until it’s unrecognizable from the original song. The goal is to create something totally new. From here you can chop and loop the beat however you’d like.


Look up your favorite beats on WhoSampled.com. You'll be surprised how often samples are used.
Heighten and lower the pitch, or slow down and quicken the speed of your favorite songs to create your own sample to be added to a new song.
Check out all of 3 Feet High and Rising or Paul's Boutique for golden-age examples of sampling prowess.

, The best way to grow quickly is to try and imitate the pros, learning the skills that will give you your own voice and creative freedom down the line. You can listen to anyone you want as long as you stop and think about why you like it so much, and what ideas you can borrow or change. For example:


Listen to famous DJ Premier’s samples from his music project called “Re:Generation.” DJ Premier is known for his signature scratching sound and flawless song constructions.Skrillex is notable for using samples of his own vocals. By using autotune, he is able to change the tone and speed of his voice so that it becomes almost unrecognizable. His song “Father Said” features samples of his own voice auto-tuned, as does “Turmoil.”Pete Rock uses samples for the entirety of his songs. He’s known to chop and layer several various samples within the same song. He’s an avid user of horns and drums, as is evident in his sample: “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)."" , The more you know about music, the easier it will be to create it. From the tuba to the turntable, the same ideas and skills are needed no matter what music you're making. So push yourself musically as much as you can -- you can always reject the ideas if they don't work.Learn how to play an instrument. Since many beats are made with a keyboard, the piano is a great place to start.

Invest in a powerful computer.,
Find the right Digital Audio Workstation for your needs.,
Replace your desktop's speakers with external ones.,
Buy extra beat-making equipment.",How to Make Beats3," If you have an older computer or one that doesn’t have much memory, this might impede on your beat making. Macs are typically considered to be the better option for music making apps, and are naturally geared towards creative work right out the box.Don't underestimate the importance of choosing the type of computer that you are most comfortable with. The goal is to make creating beats feel like second nature, and Windows computers are more than capable.Look for a computer that has at least 2 GB RAM, or random access memory. This is temporary storage within your computer that dictates how fast your computer runs.

, A DAW is a program used for editing, mixing, recording, and mastering digital audio files. This is what you'll actually be using to record instruments and add effects. While every software has its advantages, you need to keep in mind your specific needs while choosing one. Remember that your computer can also dictate what DAW you are able to use. GarageBand and Logic Studio, for instance, are only available on Apple computers.


Take your budget into account. This is most likely going to be an investment that you'll use for years to come, so consider if saving up a few extra hundred dollars will help you get the software of your dreams.Consider your experience level. Pro Tools will be hard for beginners to comprehend, and if it's too daunting, you might give up prematurely. On the other hand, experienced beat makers might not find all the bells and whistles if they go with a beginner's software, and learning Pro Tools or Logic brings you to near-pro status once you've gotten over the learning curve.
If you find using the mouse tedious and find yourself more inclined to use knobs, faders, and buttons, then you'll need to purchase an external controller or MIDI. Just like your mouse would, the knobs on a Midi device control pitch, tempo, volume and more.

, It may be difficult for you to hear the detailed music you're creating without some high-quality speakers.Studio monitor speakers make your music creations sound as accurate as possible because they are tuned to a flat response. Unlike other speakers which tend to emphasize bass or make notes sound fuller, these speakers will be consistent and precise. However, this means that the speakers don't color your creation in any way, so while you may not think it sounds good at first, you'll be able to recognize where you need work.


Active monitors already include a built-in amplifier. Aside from saving yourself from needing to purchase external equipment, this amp is made to ensure the best performance. Serious audiophiles, however, likely want an external receiver or amplifier. If this sounds too complicated, just stick to a set of speakers and don't worry about the amp.
You want speakers with at least five inches woofers., While you can definitely make many beats with little more than a computer and speakers, you're going to up plenty of new doors if you invest in more precise music equipment. At minimum, you should consider:



Keyboards: Keyboards allow you to input notes straight into the computer. You can then assign these notes to any sound or instrument you want, making a keyboard invaluable for melody making, or even drumming (if you set the keys to drum sounds).

Drum Machines: These let you assign a sound to a set of pads you can then hit like real drums.

Microphone: You can record voices or raps, but also record any sounds you hear otherwise to incorporate into the beat.

Freestyle has its own feel and listening to other rappers freestyle is a good way to learn the tricks of the trade.


Check out live battles or hip-hop freestyle competitions if your town offers them. Go and listen. This can also be a good way to meet other aspiring rhymers and make connections.
YouTube is a great resource for videos of freestyle battles from all eras. Everything from Notorious B.I.G. rapping on a street corner at the age of 17 to classic Eminem battles to the smattering of underground rappers free-styling over a new Kanye West track are good research.;
, Get a beat without any words online or loop the instrumental of a song you love on YouTube, and let it play for a while. Get a feel for the beat. If you've got a rhyming verse already written, start there, or try writing new rhymes as you listen to the beat. Repeat it over and over until you've started to get a feel for the cadence of the song and how your flow fits into it. Don't worry if you lose the beat at first.


Begin with the downbeat. The vast majority of rap music is written with a traditional four-four time signature, also known as Common Time. This means that every measure will have a strong downbeat at the beginning: ONE-two-three-four-ONE-two-three-four. Start on that beat.
Often, there will be blank space on tracks while the rapper is waiting to come in. If you don't have access to instrumentals or YouTube, you can use those spaces to practice.

, Once you've gotten a feel for the beat and you've exhausted your rhymes, take tentative steps toward a freestyle. Repeat a line you've already written but make yourself come up with a new rhyme for the second half of the rhyme.


Don't worry if what you're saying doesn't make sense at first. You're trying to get a sense of the feel of the beat and making your mind create rhymes on the fly. Nobody's listening anyway.

, If you think too much about your next line you are going trip up and stumble over the line you're on. Practice letting your mind flow freely from one thought to the next. The best freestylers are relaxed and comfortable with the beats they're working with. If it doesn't seem to be coming, don't try to force it. Listen to the beat and try to write some rhymes to it to get started, or try out another beat.


Lock yourself in your bedroom or your basement or your garage. Nobody else needs to hear your practices if you don't want them to. Putting in the hours by yourself will ensure that your debut for listeners will be all the more spectacular.

, Even if you make a mistake, train yourself to keep going. If you stutter over a word or two, spit something like, ""Did I stutter? My flow should be soft like butter."" Rap is like comedy: the timing is everything.


Experienced freestylers often have back-up lines, which serve as the fire extinguisher in the red box that's mounted on the wall of rap and used only in emergencies. This is a line, or a phrase that you use when you can't think of anything else but need to buy some time to go back out on a tangent. The better you get at freestyling the smaller this phrase will become. Really good freestylers will use a one syllable filler line like ""Yo"" or ""Matter of fact"". Eventually, your back-up filler line will be something that you can start saying without realizing it.

, The best way to increase the speed of your flow and improve your freestyle game is by reversing the way you work. If you've been practicing by starting with a line you've written and then moving away from it by improvising, make yourself start with a new line and work toward that line you've already written and you know is good.


This is where those rhyming clusters will help you. If you've got an especially good punch line, practice by rhyming as many different things as you can with it. Exercising around that line will make sure that you've got lots of different options the next time you're improvising.

, In the beginning, it makes the most sense to freestyle around hard end-rhymes like ""bear"" and ""chair,"" but eventually those may start becoming stale and leading you into clunky rhymes.Slant rhymes share consonant sounds without necessarily sharing vowel sound directly. ""Vowel"" and ""bowl"" for example, are slant rhymes.
Assonance and alliteration are sound-devices in which vowels and consonants, respectively, are repeated in a line. Edgar Allan Poe in his famous poem ""The Raven,"" uses both at once: ""the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain"" repeats ""s"" sounds and ""ur"" sounds.

, Like Cassidy's line about ""Goin' platinum like Sisqo hair"" or Raekwon's line ""I get deep like a baby seal,"" a simile that unexpectedly and creatively compares one thing to another thing is a cornerstone of freestyle hip-hop and poetry alike.


In a notebook, brainstorm different endings for similes to pull out of your hat. Fill a couple pages with ""like a _______"" and experiment by combining them all with the same line: ""My flow is cold / like a rainstorm"" or ""My flow is cold / like a sperm whale"" leave very different impressions. You may surprise yourself.

, Unless you're Rick Ross, it will be hard to pull off any grand claims about your global cocaine trafficking empire if you're a teenager from the suburbs. Rhyme about what you know and be honest. The most important thing (and the thing other freestylers will recognize) is when your skill is backed up with perspective and honesty.


While it's a good way to develop and learn, repeating other rappers lines or styles is considered extremely taboo in the freestyle world, and will need to be dispensed with as soon as you feel comfortable.

, Once you feel relatively comfortable, invite some understanding friends to watch and critique your skills. This will help you get used to freestyling in front of people and they'll be able to offer suggestions and encouragement.


Incorporate your audience into the fun by having someone pick a beat for you to rap over will get you ready for the possibility of competitions or battles if you're interested in giving one a shot. You can also have a friend pick a topic, or an item in the room, or a word and say it out loud. Start freestyling about that topic, item, or word. This forces you to keep on your toes because your friends are the ones leading the direction your freestyle goes.
If you have friends who like to freestyle too, trade verses. When one of you loses the flow, the other picks it back up. Try to start freestyling as soon as they stop and run with the same topic or rhyme scheme. If you develop a rhythm together, you might have the makings of a crew.

, The more you write raps and rhymes, the more raps and rhymes you ultimately know. As you write rhymes, practice coming up with multiple variations on the same rhyming words. These clusters of rhymes will serve you well when you begin free-styling, because you'll be able to think of something quickly if you've used these rhymes before.


Try different exercises, like picking five words at random and working them into a rhyming structure of a few lines.
Don't worry if what you're writing isn't ""rap."" Just keep the pen moving. Building good habits of journaling and writing will keep your mind disciplined toward words and thinking in terms of composition, something you'll have to do very quickly if you want to freestyle.

, If you hope to be able to freestyle, words are going to be your medium. As a painter uses paints and a sculptor uses clay, a rapper uses words, so you need to gather as big a pile of familiar words you possibly can so that you can draw on them in your rhymes. Reading a diverse variety of books, comics, online articles, and magazines is the best way to do this.


Read biographies of rappers. You can kill two birds with one stone by reading about hip-hop while simultaneously improving your vocab.

, This will soon be your best friend in the world. Look at a rhyming dictionary less as a crutch and more as creative resource. It's not cheating to look up rhyming words while you're in the middle of writing some rhymes, because it might jog something loose you'd never have thought of previously.


A good, cheap dictionary and a thesaurus are great resources too. Your rhymes will eventually be a lot more interesting the greater the variety of words becomes.

, SAT or GRE study guides are great vocabulary sources. Look up words in rap songs you don't recognize and study the definitions. Hip-hop is often jargon-heavy, using regional words, locations, and phrases, so it helps to look things up online. Chief Keef's ""Love Sosa"" doesn't make much sense if you think it's about the baseball player.


Try taping up notecards with the definitions of new words around your house. You can be learning a new word while you're making breakfast or brushing your teeth if there's a notecard taped to the wall in the kitchen and bathroom.

Keep practicing.",How to Sing Falsetto," The falsetto ""register"" (though it's more of a muscle placement than a register) lies at the top of your range. It's a different type of voice that can be found by experimenting with high-pitched sirens – that's when you mimic a siren on an ""ooh"" sound just like a fire engine or a police car.


Do them from the top of your register; not to the top of your register. Start as high as can – that should be your falsetto. It doesn't matter if it sounds good, it just has to be a legitimate note.;
, Many voice teachers tell their male students to start talking in their ""little boy"" voice. Talk like you're three or four years old – can you hear the difference? Can you feel the difference? It should feel more up and back, in the sinuses (or mask) of your face.


If that doesn't work, try imitating a female. You'll likely take on a breathy, airy tone, vaguely reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe. This is likely your falsetto.
It's possible you're going into head voice, which is different. That voice will sound a little stronger and a little more like Minnie Mouse. If this sounds accurate, try finding a register that you can't feel in your throat – many singers speak of feeling a ""muscle relief"" with falsetto., Unless you're the next Pavarotti, you probably won't be able to produce much sound with falsetto anyway. So when you go to find it, don't push yourself (and definitely don't use your throat). Keep it quiet. You're Marilyn Monroe talking in a hushed voice, not Miley Cyrus screaming at the top of her lungs.


You may find that if you try to sing louder, you'll fall into head voice. Does the resonance of your voice change? Do you start to feel it in your body? Then you're not singing in falsetto anymore.

, Because of the way the throat and vocal folds are constructed, ""aahh"" and ""aayyy"" do not work well for finding falsetto. ""Eee"" and ""oooh"" are much more conducive to getting the sound up and into your mask and letting your vocal folds go.


On this vowel, slide around from top to bottom. Do you hear how the timbre of your voice changes? When it gets really light towards the top and you feel fewer vibrations internally, that's your falsetto.

, Think of the tone you're producing as an elevator within your body. When you produce a low note, it's deep within you, resonating in your core. When you produce a high note, as you do with falsetto, it's up in your forehead, coming out the top of your body.


It's also a forward. If it's placed in the back of your mouth and subsequently in the back of your head, you'll have a very dark, muffled sound, which is no good for falsetto. Keep your tongue forward on the tip of your teeth and make sure it stays flat – if it's spatulated, it'll cover your sound.

, If you've ever taken singing lessons, you're well aware that a lot of coaching is abstract metaphors that somehow make sense and improve your sound. One of them is to ""open up your head."" It means just what it sounds like, and it likely works because it gets you focusing on producing sound up and forward, like in the above step.


Generally, you want to keep everything open. Singing should be a relaxing endeavor that involves no tension. To produce a good sound falsetto or otherwise, your centre should be open, your lungs need to be open, and your mouth needs to be open, too.

, Once you find this ""register,"" experiment with pulling it down, or sliding down to lower notes. It's the type of voice that's mandatory at the top of your range, but optional toward the bottom. What kind of low notes can you produce that are a little more airy and feminine sounding?


This will differ from person to person, singer to singer. If you've been relying on your ""chest voice"" or ""real voice"" for as long as you can remember, doing this will be difficult for your vocal folds – they're just not used to that kind of free vibration. But don't worry – if you keep practising regardless of how it sounds, it will get better.

, For most untrained, non-professional singers, it's difficult to produce vibrato within the falsetto voice. This is because the vocal folds are barely touching, making it difficult to control the airflow going through your throat. If you can only sing on a straight tone in this voice, relax. That's normal.


Once you get the hang of it, you can try using your vibrato with this voice, though be prepared for it to be difficult. You'll likely want to gravitate to your head voice – which is very similar, but different.

, As mentioned previously, using your falsetto means your vocal folds are just barely touching. The air is passing through at an unimpeded rate, giving your voice that airy tone. At the top of your range, the folds are stretched to become longer by the action of the cricothyroid muscles while the thyro-arytenoid muscle remains still and motionless.Didn't know you were in for an anatomy lesson today, huh?


Walk up to the person who knows nothing about singing and they'll tell you it's something some people can do and something some people just can't. Walk up to someone who does it for a living, and they'll tell you that it's a conscious effort of placement and focus to get the sound just right – it's by no means something you can do correctly off the bat. Good singing is generally learnt. Everyone can do it, but somehow not everyone knows how.


, When we breathe moment to moment, we don't think about it. But when we start singing, we start realizing that we have to ration it to get through the measures and sometimes we end up inadvertently holding it at certain pitches. Don't do this. Breathe fully and deeply into the bottom of your lungs and keep the air flowing. If you stop it, you either won't make a noise or you won't be in falsetto.


Always, always, always let go. Of everything. Loosen up, shake it out, and relax. Being tense and listening to your voice as it comes out of your mouth will only result in you holding your breath and not producing the best sound you're capable of. A lot of singing is actually in the mind – you are your only obstacle.

, Plenty of people avoid their falsetto (or even head voice at times) because it sounds weak. It doesn't have that oomph that the chest voice does. This is normal. This can be a very good sound – you just have to get used to hearing it.


Take a look at Broadway in the recent decades as compared to in the earlier parts of the 20th century and you'll see a huge movement toward belting, using chest voice. No voice is better than the other – but they do go in and out of style.

, Every singer has a break (the passaggio), if not more than one. In futzing around with your different types of ""voices,"" you'll likely crack. Until you get super comfortable with the way your vocal folds are stretching and vibrating together, this is going to happen. Relax.


Singing over your break is something that takes practice and diligence for many. With time and usage you can strengthen weaker areas of your vocal folds and correct old habits that have you jumping from one voice to the other and never bridging the two.

, You know that little bit of your throat that moves up and down when you swallow? You can actually control that. Try it right now – take a look in the mirror and get your Adam's apple area to move downward. Can you keep it there while you sing?


This opens up your throat, allowing air to flow through unobstructed. It also pulls your tongue flat and down, working to the same end. A high larynx (go on, try it) feels tight and taut, and sound is much harder to produce in this position.

, Singing is a skill. Sure, lots of people have natural talent, but it's essentially body control – it all starts out involuntary until you train yourself to recognize it and make it do what you want. So keep practicing – you'll be in tune with your habits in time.


It's a good idea to join a choir or get a vocal coach. If for some reason neither of those are available, even just watching videos on YouTube is a good start. What's more, plenty of voice teachers do online lessons if that works out better for your schedule.

Your body should not be tilted to one side or the other. Make sure your head isn't tipped back or forwards., Correct breathing is one of the most important things when singing. When you breathe, make sure you are taking air from your diaphragm instead of your chest. This means when you breathe in, your abdomen will expand instead of your chest. When you sing, you will push down on the diaphragm when you ascend a scale and release when you come back down the scale.Supporting your voice with the diaphragm is one of the keys to singing.


To practice, place a hand on your stomach and inhale through your nose. Your abdomen should expand and jut out when you breathe in. Your chest should not move out or up. As you exhale, push down and contract the abdominal muscles. It should feel like doing a sit up. Repeat until this is natural when you are singing.

, One quick way to improve your singing is to open your vowels. This is called open throat technique. To achieve this, start by saying ""ah"" or ""uh."" Elongate your mouth without widening it. You want to separate your tongue from your soft palette and keep them separated while you sing. Your tongue should be against your bottom jaw. This gives you better quality.Try saying A-E-I-O-U. Your jaw should not close on any of those. If you can't keep your jaw down, use your fingers to pull it down. Keep repeating the vowels until you can say them with your mouth open.
Sing the vowels. Keep the jaw open while you sing them like you did while saying them. Then sing a phrase and open the jaw when you sing each vowel.
This will probably take some practice to achieve, but it will help improve the quality of your singing.By doing this you can start to grow your voice., When you are singing higher notes and trying to get power, keep your chin pointed down. Your head has a tendency to move up as you sing higher notes, which can cause problems to your vocal chords. Singing while focusing on keeping the chin down helps give your voice more power and control., First, you must find your vocal range. After you have done that, you can begin to increase your vocal range. To do this, you must have proper technique. You must have non-airy vowels and proper resonance in your voice before you try to extend your vocal range.To extend your vocal range, do it a half-step or full step at a time. Practice with short scales and get comfortable singing that new note properly before trying to push your voice any higher or lower.
Taking lessons from a vocal coach is the safest, most effective way of increasing your range.

, Your voice is made up of 3 areas. Moving between these areas changes the resonance of your voice. Learning how to control this change can help improve your singing.


The voice has three different areas: the chest register, the head register, and the middle register. Each of these areas refers to the range of notes sung from that section of the body.
Head voice is the higher area. When you sing high notes, they will resonate in your head. Place your hand on the top of your head as you sing high notes to feel the vibrations. Chest voice is the lower area of your singing voice. When you sing lower notes, they will resonate in your chest. Middle voice - or mixed voice - is the middle area between your chest voice and head voice. This area is where your voice will shift from the chest to the head to properly sing the notes.As you transition from high notes to low notes, you need go from head to chest voice. You should feel the notes moving up towards your head or down to your chest as you sing. Don't keep the notes in the same place as you ascend or descend. This will limit the quality of your voice., Water helps keep the vocal chords moist and fluid so they can easily open and close. You can also drink any other unsweetened, decaffeinated, nonalcoholic beverage for the same effect. Aim to have at least one pint of water a day.Lukewarm drinks are the best for your throat. Drink something warm such as warm water or warm tea with honey. Try to avoid cold things, like ice creams or cold fizzy drinks, because they can cause your muscles to tense., If you want to sing better, you have to train your voice. This takes commitment. Doing vocal exercises a few times a week or month is not going to make a significant difference. Exercise your voice every single day. You want to train it and develop the muscles so you can enhance your voice.Remember, before doing any vocal exercises, make sure you warm up.

, Say, ""Hmm?"" Or say, ""hmm"" like you aren't sure you believe someone. Both of those noises should change in pitch. When practicing scales while humming, you want to feel a buzzing around your nose, eyes, and head, or down into your chest.


Hum Doh-Mi-Sol on an ascending scale, then back down to Mi-Doh. While you are humming, work on the accuracy of your pitch., A lip trill is when you blow air through your lips, causing them to flap and vibrate. It sounds like a br, like you are cold. If your lips are tense when you exhale air through them, they will not vibrate. Try to relax your lips, and if that doesn't work, push the corners of your mouth towards your nose while you do the exercise.Try doing tongue trills. This helps you relax your swallowing muscles so you keep them relaxed while you're singing., When you are trying to hit high notes, you want to keep your larynx steady instead of lifting it. This gives you better vocal control and helps avoid strain. To practice keeping the larynx steady, say ""mum"" over and over. Do this until you feel relaxed saying the word.Lightly hold your thumbs under your chin. Swallow. You should feel your swallowing/throat muscles engaging. When you sing, you want these muscles to be relaxed. Sing scales while making the ""mmm"" sound with your mouth closed. Your throat muscles should remain relaxed.
You may end up making a funny face as you try to keep the sound in the top part of your face. That's okay. Exaggerate the facial movement and the sound if you have to. The important thing is to train your swallowing muscles to stay relaxed while going through the scales., One way to help you break through your nerves is to practice at home. When you practice, you need to take it even farther than usual. For example, sing louder and bolder, try different moves, or act crazy. Gain confidence in yourself before trying to gain confidence in front of others.As you practice in the mirror or on video, learn how to show your emotion and passion on stage. It may feel uncomfortable at first to be that honest and vulnerable on stage, but some of the best professional singers have the confidence to sing honestly and emotionally., One of the ways you can build your confidence is to continuously step out of your comfort level. This can be many things. You may try singing in front of an audience. It may mean learning how to extend your range, or even singing in another genre. Developing your voice, trying new things, and learning everything you can will help build your confidence., After practicing and learning new singing skills, you need to start singing in front of people. Start by singing in front of trusted friends and family members. Start with one person, then build slowly. This can help you get used to singing in front of people.Ask them to critique you when you sing. This can help you get better if you are making mistakes.

, Another way to build your confidence is to sing in your community. This may not be as difficult or nerve-wracking as a concert or more formal event. Look for opportunities at nursing homes or children's hospitals.


Try auditioning for local theater or sign up for acting classes. This might help you gain the confidence to be on stage in front of people without having to sing. Then you you apply that to singing.

, Though karaoke with your friends is not a formal concert setting, singing in this environment can help you gain confidence. Though it's not helping your vocal technique, you can start to lose the anxiety you feel singing in front of a crowd., The first time or two you sing on stage, sing a familiar song. This helps your confidence from the start. Choose a song in your range that flatters your voice. Don't try to do anything fancy with it; instead, sing it like the original. The key at this point is just to get you comfortable on stage singing in front of people.


As you build your confidence, you can make the song your own, adapt your own style, and change it., If you are shaking, move around to help disguise the nerves. You can move your hips or walk around a little to help you appear confident and focus your nervous energy in another way.


Try looking at a point above the audience if you are really nervous. Don't look at them. Find a spot on the back wall to focus all your attention to as you ignore the audience."

Breathe the correct way.,
Keep your soft palate high and your tongue forward.,
Practice every day and you will get so much better!",How to Sing Clearly," Breathe in and out using your Diaphragm (your stomach). When you breathe in,your stomach should expand. When you breathe out, it should go back. Make sure that there is no movement in your chest. Breathing from your chest is shallow and unsupported, whereas breathing from your diaphragm allows your to use your 'Powerhouse' (the muscles in your stomach) to support the notes you are singing and keep you in tune.;
, Run your tongue across the roof of your mouth. The hard part is called your hard palate and the fleshy bit behind it is called your soft palate.You need to create space at the back of you mouth in order for a richer tone to be produced. We do this by raising our soft palate. To raise your soft palate, yawn or laugh. That feeling of space is your soft palate being raised. You should have the feeling every time you sing. This keeps it off your throat, which can create long term damage. Your the tip of your tongue should be in constant contact with the back of your teeth, as this focuses the sound forward and creates a clearer tone.

, Scales, as boring as they are, are is the best way of getting a clearer, brighter tone. Try singing on the syllable 'te' to start, as the 'e' vowel is the easiest sing.

Keep your shoulders back and down.,
Hold your head level.,
Flatten your abdomen.,
Stand with your feet slightly apart, one in front of the other.,
Relax your joints.,
Practice good posture in the mirror.",How to Sing Beautifully1," Do not slouch your shoulders forward or hunch them up by your ears. Your posture should be relaxed and confident. Use your shoulders to slightly lift your chest up, making room for your lungs to take in more air. Think of Superman posing triumphantly.


Don’t force this posture unnaturally. Simply focus on keeping your shoulders as far back as possible while still feeling comfortable.;
, Your chin should be parallel to the floor. This is essential for keeping the airway in your throat open – looking up or down will constrict your vocal chords and limit your singing ability., Do not bend forwards or backwards from the waist. Instead, stand up straight so that your shoulders are above your ankles and your back is relaxed.

, Your feet should be 6–7 inches (15.2–17.8 cm) apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. This will keep you weight slightly forward as you sing., Keep your knees and elbows loose and slightly bent so that you are not standing rigidly in place. This helps more than just your posture – a relaxed, loose body helps you generate air and control your voice while you sing., The best way to see your mistakes is in the mirror. Watch yourself from the side and from the front, fixing any mistakes as you see them. You can also practice against a wall—simply stand against it in bare feet, focusing on making your head, shoulders, butt, and heel touch the wall.Remember:


Shoulders back.
Chin level with the floor.
Chest out.
Stomach flat.
Joints relaxed.

Exhale quickly and steadily until your lungs are completely empty.,
Keep your lungs empty for about 5 seconds.,
Fill up your lungs with a single quick breath.,
Take a few (2-3) normal, steady breaths.,
Repeat this exercise 3 times daily for 20 minute periods.",How to Do a Breath Control Exercise for Rapping1," You’ll feel your chest depress slowly as the air escapes your lungs; this will feel uncomfortable at first but you’ll quickly get used to it.


Start slowly when first performing this exercise. It’s possible to hurt yourself if you release the air too quickly or too strongly. If you feel discomfort or pain, stop immediately.;
, In doing this, you are fully extending the muscles in your diaphragm. This helps to condition and strengthen your diaphragm. It will improve your endurance and make you less likely to run out of breath.As you hold this position, your reflex will be to inhale. Resist this temptation or you’ll limit the exercise’s effectiveness.

, Inhale as soon as you’ve held your breath for 5 seconds. Once your lungs are completely filled with air, hold this position for 10 seconds. Filling your lungs this way helps to expand your lung capacity, meaning you’ll need to take less breaths when you rap., This helps re-establish normal oxygen levels in preparation for your next repetition. You shouldn’t perform the exercise multiple times back to back without resetting; this could injure your respiratory system.

, Between the exercise itself and the recuperation between each “rep”, you should be able to perform about 15-20 reps per 20 minute set. Your 3 daily sets don’t necessarily have to be performed one after the other; feel free to perform them throughout the day. For instance, you can perform one when you wake up in the morning, one around lunch and one just before bed.


If you perform this exercise daily, you should see noticeable results within 4-8 weeks as your diaphragm becomes stronger and more flexible.
Doing this will allow you to flow stronger for longer periods of time. As you’re not constantly rushing for breath, you’ll sound more confident when performing and have the ability to add more emphasis to your lyrics.

Learn to put words together with rhythm, rhyme and patterns of meaning.,
Write every day.,
Practice, practice, practice your delivery.,
Study the greats.",How to Become a Professional Rapper1," At its most basic level, rapping is reciting rhyming lyrics over a beat, but good raps use a variety of linguistic devices, such as alliteration, repetition and wordplay. Good raps also have a dynamism and flow that keeps the song interesting while also staying on beat.


Study poetry, literature and music to understand what is possible.
Make a game out of learning to rap by trying to say all your everyday sentences in the form of improvised rap. This will give you fresh ideas and help you develop an instinct for how words flow together.;
, Write about topics you know and care about, but don't be afraid to experiment. Write down any lyrics that come into your head throughout the day, but also spend some time sitting and composing whole songs with several verses, hooks, and a bridge.


Write down as many rhymes and interesting word combinations as you can. Over his career Eminem has collected dozens of boxes of notebooks filled with potential rap lines. You should be able to fill at least one.

, Having the greatest lyrics in the world won't get you anywhere if you can't rap them with confidence, dynamism, flow and charisma. Practice rapping your lyrics loudly and passionately, and as much as possible. Try different speeds, volumes, inflections and places to pause for breath.



Memorize the lyrics of other rappers with great flow, and try singing along. When you think you've mastered them, get the instrumental version of your favorite track and try to rap the song without the original artist's voice to guide you. Then when you can do that, practice the song a cappella.
Figure out what is interesting about your own voice and make the most of it. Don't try to imitate other rappers—capitalize on your own unique sound.

Breathe deeply and evenly when singing.,
Use your abdomen for breathing, not your chest.,
Push your stomach out as you inhale.,
Let your stomach suck back in as you exhale.,
Practice breathing deeply.,
Avoid common breathing mistakes.",How to Sing Beautifully2," Your normal breathing pattern is shallow and quick because your body does not need as much oxygen as when you are singing. When singing, you need to be able to inhale a lot of air quickly, then exhale it slowly and steadily as you sing., This is the biggest change burgeoning singers need to make when breathing. Think of breathing ‘’horizontally,’’ so that your belly expands as you inhale and sucks in and up as you exhale.Think of a ring around your stomach and waist expanding as you inhale and contracting as you exhale, moving the air from the bottom of your lungs up to your chest and out your mouth.Note how, as you breathe normally, your chest rises and falls. When you sing, however, your chest needs to be still.

, Put a hand on your stomach. When you inhale, focusing on filling your lower lungs by expanding your stomach as you breathe.


Your chest should not move.

, Again, your chest should not move. As you become more experienced you will feel your back slightly expand out as you exhale.

, You’ve spent most of your life taking shallow, natural breaths, so you need to practice proper singing breaths to make them a habit. Try the following techniques to perfect your breath:


Lie on the floor with both hands on your stomach. Inhale through your stomach so your hands rise above your chest, then exhale back to starting position.
Practice hissing. Hissing requires a steady, thin stream of air. Inhale for 4 counts (1, 2, 3, 4) and then exhale for 4 counts. Then inhale for 6 counts and exhale for 10. Progress with shorter inhalations and longer hissing until you can breathe in for 1 count and exhale for 20.The best signers actually use very little air to sing big, loud notes, so take this exercise seriously.

, Because breathing while singing is so different from natural breathing, there are a number of mistakes that beginners make when trying to focus on breathing and singing all at once. Cutting these mistakes will lead to beautiful singing faster. Some to avoid include:


’’’Tanking up:’’’ Trying to fill your lungs as much as possible so you don’t run out of air. Instead of focusing on having more air, think about exhaling as steadily as possible to preserve your air.
’’’Pushing air:’’’ For a beautiful tone, think about letting the air out of your lungs instead of forcing it out.
’’’Holding back air:’’’ An advanced mistake, this is when singers stop their voice in between inhaling and exhaling. Focus on breathing “into” your note, silently exhaling air right before starting to sing."
"
Set a goal for your voice.,
Sing from your chest.,
Learn to hone your “resonators.’’’”’’’ At the core of beautiful singing is the ability to create resonance, which is when your notes take on a rich, full sound.,
Sing songs within your range, or comfort zone.,
Hire a vocal coach for personalized, guided advice.",How to Sing Beautifully3," Typically, beautiful singing is both “clear” and “resonant.” Everyone has a different definition of beautiful, but there is some common ground between all the best singers. Think about the singers you admire and the type of music you want so sing, as you develop your beautiful voice.


’’’Clear:’’’ The listener should be able to hear the words and notes without strain.
’’’Resonant:’’’ Resonance is the deep, almost subconscious vibrations that all beautiful singers access. Think of the long, powerful, and sustained notes of singers from Aretha Franklin to Luciano Pavarotti., Most beginning singers feel themselves singing through their throat, and they can feel the pressure in their head and neck as they sing. While this may feel natural, it is the wrong way to sing if you want to sing beautifully. Focus instead on your chest so that you feel it vibrating as you sing. You should feel pressure in your chest, as if you voice is coming from your pectoral muscles.


This is easiest if you are correctly breathing through your abdomen
Think of singing from your diaphragm (the muscle under your lungs that controls breathing) if you are having trouble singing from your chest.

, Listen to any opera singer to hear resonance at its best. Your voice echoes in your chest, mouth, and throat to gain depth. When you are singing with resonance, you feel a slight buzzing or vibrating feeling. To develop resonance, think about your voice’s “placement.” Where do you feel the sound coming from? How does it move as you open your lips or move your tongue? Everyone is different, but there are some tips to keep in mind:


Start by humming a simple “ee” sound. “Move” this noise up and down from your chest to your mouth. These are your resonators
Move your tongue down towards your bottom teeth, opening up your mouth and making the biggest space you can.Never “swallow” your vowels, or sing from the back of your throat. When you do, they become muddied and unclear.

, Some people are not comfortable singing high-pitched songs, no matter how much they practice. Others feel most at home in the upper register singing soprano parts. Through careful practice you can find your range, which is the series of notes that you sing most comfortably. When trying to find your vocal range, focus on singing with your chest and not your “head voice,” which is where you feel yourself singing in your throat.


Sing the lowest note you can without cracking or creaking. This is the bottom of your range.
Sing your highest note without cracking or creaking. This is the top of your range.
Your singing range includes all of the notes in between this upper and lower limit.

, This is essential for the burgeoning singing, because there is only so much you can learn on your own. Vocal coaches know mechanics, music theory, and how to diagnose problems you can’t hear yourself. Your voice sounds differently to you then to other people, so an experienced guide is necessary to truly sing beautifully.Your coach should make you feel comfortable, and have either extensive performing experience or a degree in vocal training."

Warm-up before singing.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Avoid large amounts of alcohol, caffeine, and dairy.,
Try not to yell.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Sing Beautifully4," Just like an athlete needs to prepare their muscles, a singer needs to warm up their voice to prevent strain and injury. Don’t start with a song, or even vowels and consonants. Instead, run through some scales with simple sounds and breaths. Exercises for your warmup include:


Hum. Humming activates your breath without straining your vocal chords.Trill your lips and tongue to warm up your mouth and jaw (ie. roll your r’s)
Begin with a simple scale, going up and down slowly (doh – mi – sol – mi – doh).
Begin with the easiest songs you are going to practice, waiting 10-15 minutes to tackle the tougher parts.

, Vocal chords flap and vibrate to create sound, and they need to be properly lubricated to move freely. Drink 4-6 glasses of water a day and keep a full water bottle near you wen practicing. On the night of a concert, make sure that you drink water throughout the day and before performing.Make sure you start drinking at least 30 minutes before performing so that your body has time to absorb the water.

, You need to feel well rested to focus on your singing technique and prevent vocal fatigue or injury. Adults should get 6-8 hours of regular sleep each night in order to sing as beautifully as possible.

, Alcohol and caffeine dry out your throat, causing your to strain as you sing.Eating or drinking a lot of dairy products promotes the creation of mucous, which can inhibit proper breathing techniques., Yelling strains your voice by forcing air violently through your vocal chords. Speak softly whenever possible to protect your voice when you need it,

, Smoking damages the tissue in your lungs and should be avoided at all costs. There are fewer things that can do permanent damage to your beautiful singing voice then smoking."

Lie down in a pushup position.,
Push yourself up and inhale.,
Exhale as you return to the starting position.,
Perform this exercise 10 additional times.",How to Do a Breath Control Exercise for Rapping2," You should be on your stomach, your palms flat on the ground and underneath your shoulders. Keep your spine straight, and lower your head until your neck is aligned with your spine., Press through your hands as you push yourself up. Your upper body should slowly start curving upwards, from your head all the way down to your hips. Keep your body still from the waist down. Inhale the entire time you’re pushing up. Pull your shoulder blades together when you reach the top position, opening your chest further.


You’ll notice you need to strain slightly to take in a full breath. This opens up the chest and deepens your lung capacity., Slowly bring your upper body back down towards the ground, allowing yourself to rest gently on the ground. You should be following the same curve as the previous step. Your chest should touch the ground first, followed by your shoulders, neck, chin and head., You can take a couple of seconds between each repetition to reset properly. You shouldn’t be hurrying as you perform this exercise; the goal is to slowly learn how to control your breathing and expand your lung capacity.

Choose the right cardiovascular exercise.,
Warm up and stretch before exercising.,
Sprint, nonstop, for 20 seconds.,
Slow down and recover for 40 seconds.,
Repeat this sequence 10 times.",How to Do a Breath Control Exercise for Rapping3," Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your lung capacity and your ability to control your breathing. The type of exercise that’s right for you depends on the equipment available to you as well as your limitations. For instance, if you have bad knees, running can cause pain and damage to these vulnerable joints.Some options for cardiovascular exercise include:


Swimming
Cycling
Rowing

, Not warming up properly can lead to a host of injuries, such as pulled muscles and sprained ankles.Perform a light cardiovascular exercise (such as jumping jacks) and stretch.

, This means you’re pushing yourself as hard as you can for the entire 20 seconds. Rather than performing low impact cardiovascular training for extended periods of time, you’ll want to use high intensity interval training (HIIT). While both are effective for improving your lung capacity, HIIT workouts are more efficient as they’re usually completed in a fraction of the time.If you’re already in good physical shape, you can increase your work time to 30 or 40 seconds for a more strenuous workout.
If swimming, be careful not to push yourself too hard as you could risk drowning.

, After your 20 seconds of work, lower your pace to a point where you’re able to talk and catch your breath. For instance, if you’re running, you’ll slow to a light jog for 40 seconds. The pace should be just enough to keep your heart rate going while still giving you a chance to recover.


If you’re in good physical shape, try decreasing your recovery time to 30 or 20 seconds.

, The total workout should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.Start by doing this workout a few times a week, and you should notice your lung capacity and breathing improve.

Get some next-level beats.,
Record your raps.,
Mix some songs.,
Make your first mixtape.",How to Become a Professional Rapper2," Every great rap song should have a unique and catchy beat to set it apart from all the average songs that clog the radio. www.hytmanbeats.com is a good site to find beats.


Purchasing beat making software and equipment can be costly, and learning how to make your own beats is often just as big an undertaking as learning how to rap. If you can do it, however, making your own beats is definitely worth it as it gives you fuller creative control over your songs and a deeper understanding of the music.
If you don't want to make your own beats, you can hire or partner with a producer. Make sure this person is talented and listen to some of their other work before you buy anything.
If you are just starting off and can't afford your own beats yet, consider getting instrumental versions of popular rap songs and rap over these. Just make sure you are following fair use rules for copyrighted material. And of course, you can't rap over other artists' songs forever.

, You can do this best at a professional recording studio, but with a little work you can also set up a recording studio in your home.


Do several takes for every part of your song—you aren't Eminem just yet! Don't worry if you mess up; you can always use another take for that part.

, Get your recordings mastered and put your raps over your best beats. Work on your songs until they sound great, adjusting the beat and the vocals until they match seamlessly.


Give your song a name. Consider using a recognizable word or phrase from the hook.

, Many people think of mixtapes as collections of songs by various artists that you burn together for your boyfriend or girlfriend. But to aspiring rappers a mixtape is a much like an album, just usually less refined and often distributed informally or for free. Once you have a number of songs you like, combine the best 7-15 of them into a mixtape.


Think about the order of the songs on your mixtape. Even if the songs aren't necessarily related, try to craft a sort of narrative or emotional arc with the songs.
Create some album art. This can be anything, from a photo of yourself to just text on a plain background to abstract art. If you aren't visually artistic, get an artist to help you.
Burn some CD copies to distribute or release your mixtape online.
If you don't have enough songs for a mixtape but still want to start getting your music out there, consider just releasing a single instead. Make sure it's a great one, and give your single cover art just like an album would have.

Get a record deal—or make it indie!",How to Become a Professional Rapper3," Get your name out there by rocking your local open mic events. All you have to do is sign up and sing. Make sure you pick events with a hip-hop audience.



Freestyle battling is a whole world in itself. You don't have to be a great freestyler to be a good rapper, but it certainly helps. Battling is a way to hone your skills and get known.

, There is a vibrant world of underground and aspiring rappers who share and discuss their music on the Internet. Simply putting your music out online doesn't mean anyone will notice or listen to it—you have to work to promote it.


Submit your music to sites like DJBooth and send it to popular hip-hop blogs.
Get a Myspace account, a Facebook page, and a Twitter account. Use these to share your music and get the word out about your shows and upcoming releases. Build a following and keep them interested.

, Ask around at music venues and try to get gigs with a hip-hop audience, perhaps opening for bigger acts. Try to earn some money from these, but don't be afraid to do a few shows for free to get your name out there.


Print some t-shirts, burn some mixtapes and make other merchandise to sell at your shows.
Work on your stage presence. Don't just get up there and recite your lines—you have to engage the audience. Use your words, your expression and your body. Pay attention to what the audience likes and give them more.

, Once you start to get some traction, you may need help taking your career to the next level. A manager can take over some of the work promoting your music, booking gigs and talking to record labels. Just be careful that your manager is looking out for your interests, not just his own.

, Rapping isn't a solitary art—much of the time it is something you do with other people, producers, singers or other rappers. Network and build strong relationships with other people in the industry you meet. Do collaborations with them whenever you can.


Having a verse on another rapper's song exposes you and your skills to a whole new audience.
Having another rapper do a verse for you is kind of like an endorsement. People will notice your music more if you have notable collaborators.

, Landing a deal with a major hip-hop label is the dream of most rap artists. A record deal puts a ton of resources and clout at your fingertips and starts you down the track to real fame. However remember that record companies are out to make money for themselves, and sometimes you might be better off starting your own label or partnering with another indie to release your music.

Create a modified drum tab.,
Create and label additional lines for additional sounds.,
Create a symbol for each original sound.",How to Create Patterns in Beatboxing1," Beatbox patterns typically incorporate three types of sounds: snares, hi-hats, and basslines. Create and label a line in your drum tab for each type of sound to map out your pattern. Separate beats with a single vertical line, and bars with double vertical lines, like so:


S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|;
, For example, if you wish to use a vocalization in place of a traditional sound, create a fourth line in your drum tab and label it “V:”


S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
V |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|

, Whenever you use an additional sound that’s unique to your pattern, create a symbol to denote that sound within the drum tab. Then define that symbol below the drum tab for others’ reference as well as your own. For example, if you’re going to vocalize the word “What?” in place of a traditional sound, use “W” as a symbol within the drum tab, and define “W” below the bar tab as “W = Vocalized 'What?'"" like so:


S |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
H |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----| 
B |----|----|----|----||----|----|----|----|
V |----|----|----|----||W---|----|W---|----|
W = Vocalized “What?”

Hissing is a good beginning breathing exercise.Breathe in to the count of 4. Breathe out, hissing, to the count of 4. Then, breathe in for 6, and hiss out for 10. Breathe in for 6, out for 12. Breathe in for 2, out for 12. Breathe in for 4, out for 16. Breathe in for 2, out for 16. Breathe in for 4, out for 20. Breathe in for 1, out for 20.

, When you accidentally mess up, start over until you get it perfectly. You want to get it right the first time and every time. When rappers perform live, they only get one shot at getting it right. Mistakes are bound to happen, so don't beat yourself up over it. Just keep working to minimize their frequency.

, Try this exercise for 5 to 10 minutes a day to practice your technique and build speed. If you want you can time yourself to see how much faster you are getting over time.

Start a Fire and have enough places for everyone to sit.
,
Gather everyone in your party.,
Ask everyone in the circle what songs they would like to sing.,
Sing a song requested by each person in the circle.

,
Check to see if everyone knows the words to the songs or print lyrics beforehand for a few select songs.,
Assign each person instruments.,

Sing songs in unison or have one person sing one verse and another person sing another verse.,
Encourage singing, not yelling.,
Motivate participants to clap their hands or snap their fingers to make the beat for the music.",How to Sing Campfire Songs,", Have everyone sit in a circle around the fire. They can bring their chairs, sit on rocks or sit on blankets to give them added comfort.

, Go around the circle and ask each person what song each person would like to sing. Some good choices might be:


House of the Rising Sun. It’s hard to say what exactly makes “House of the Rising Sun” such a perfect fit for the campfire, but it might have something to do with that incredible folk rock arrangement. It’s a great song that most everybody knows, is easy to sing, and creates a ""feel good"" atmosphere.

Don’t Stop Believing. Most everyone knows it and you can’t help but sing along. It’s the ultimate bonding song.

California Dreamin’. This song has the perfect feel and beat to listen to while chatting around the campfire. It’ll sound just right mixed with the crackling of the fire.

She Lit a Fire. A great song; just perfect for camping.

,, Hand these printed lyrics out when no one knows the words to the songs.

, Ask if anyone knows how to play the guitar, bongos or harmonica. Introduce these instruments into the songs gradually. You can also make your own musical instruments with keys, bottles, twigs and rocks gathered at the campsite.

, Continue going around the circle until everyone has a chance to sing a verse. Once everyone sings one verse, everyone can sing the remaining verses of the song together., Start out with slow songs and gradually build up intensity and enthusiasm with songs using more energy.

, They can also tap their feet on the ground or do any other activity that makes an interesting sound.

Begin with a simple beat.,
Speed up your hi-hats.,
Switch up the rhythm.",How to Create Patterns in Beatboxing2," For snares, one of the more basic sounds is the tongue snare without lungs, represented by the symbol “K."". For hi-hats, start with the “ts” snare (“T”). For bass, use the soft bass drum (“B”). Practice each sound individually until you’re comfortable with them, and then practice combining them with this basic pattern:


S |----|K---|----|K---||----|K---|----|K---| 
H |--T-|--T-|--T-|--T-||--T-|--T-|--T-|--T-|
B |B---|----|B---|----||B---|----|B---|----|

, To practice executing them faster, increase your use of the “ts” snare (“T”) within each beat and perform it twice in a row, back to back. Practicing the double hi-hat in the pattern below will help quicken your execution without overdoing it:


S |----|K---|----|K---||----|K---|----|K---|
H |--TT|--TT|--TT|--TT||--TT|--TT|--TT|--TT| 
B |B---|----|B---|----||B---|----|B---|----|

, Once you’ve mastered the double hi-hat in a steady rhythm, practice a more complex pattern with a modified double hi-hat. Use the double “ts” sound (“T”) to end one beat, and then again to begin another. Not only will this help you to grow comfortable with using the hi-hat in new ways, it will also force you to do the same with the other sounds, such as the bass in this example:


S |----|K---|----|K---||----|K---|----|K---| 
H |--TT|----|TT--|--TT||--TT|----|TT--|--TT| 
B |B---|--B-|--B-|----||B---|--B-|--B-|-B--|

"
"
Build your arsenal.,
Combine new sounds.,
Listen to various styles.,
Create new patterns.",How to Create Patterns in Beatboxing3," Once you’ve mastered the basics, practice other snares, hi-hats, and basslines. Practice each new sound individually until you execute them perfectly. This way you’ll have a wider array of sounds with which to create more diverse patterns.


Expand your snare sounds with the tongue snare with lungs (“C”), the “pff” or lip snare (“P”), and the techno snare (“G.”)
For hi-hats, try the open “tssss” snare (“S”) and successive hi-hats (‘tk”).
For bass, learn the bumskid bass drum (“JB”), the strong bass drum (“B”), the sweeping bass drum (“X”), and the techno bass drum (“U”)

, Once you’re comfortable using the basic sounds in more complex patterns, incorporate the new sounds you’ve learned. Attempt more advanced patterns, like this:


S |----|K---|----|K---||----|K---|----|K---| 
H |-tk-|-tk-|tk-t|-tkt||-tk-|-tk-|tkSS|--tk| 
B |B--b|---B|--B-|----||B--b|---B|--B-|----|

, Beatboxing is featured in a variety of music: hip-hop, R&B, house, techno, and more. The way it’s used in each style varies as well. Listen to a wide sampling from each and study both the obvious and subtle differences between them. Perform those beats yourself to better understand how each genre varies from one to the next.

, With a wider variety of sounds and a better understanding of genre, decide on a style of music and compose your own pattern. Take baby-steps: beat by beat, bar by bar. Pay attention to your own sense of rhythm and build on that. Keep your pattern clean and uncluttered so you can execute it perfectly; it’s better to adhere to the basics than to attempt more than you can physically perform at the moment.

Try a rapper name generator.,
Use your life to inspire your name-to-be.,
Ask around.,
Model your name after a favorite rapper.",How to Come up With a Rapper Name2," The Internet is brimming with free word generators, and some of them are specifically designed to come up with rapper names.Even if you don't go with exactly what the algorithm gives you, a generator might set you on the right track.


You might even be able to find rapper name ""quizzes"" online that tell you which sort of rapper name you should choose.

, Choose a name, word, or place from your childhood. Name yourself after something that is ever-present in your life. You have the chance to define your name, but you also want your name to define you – so pick something that reflects the way that you are living.

, Talk to friends, family, and other rappers to see if they have any ideas. The people that you see everyday are the ones who observe and know you the best – so there's a good chance that they'll at least put you on track to finding your ideal rap name.


Just say, ""I'm trying to come up with a good rapper name. Do you have any ideas?""
Look for perspective on how you come across. Ask, ""How do I come across when I rap?""

, This doesn't necessarily mean that you should call yourself ""C-Diddy"" if you love P-Diddy. Study the stage names of rappers that you admire, and think about why their name suits them so well. Use a similar structure or a similar lyrical device. Read about how famous rappers picked their names."
"
Drop the name into a song.,
Don't be afraid to use multiple names.,
Ask for opinions.,
Remember that nothing is permanent.",How to Come up With a Rapper Name3," You don't have to stick to a name just because you say it out loud – especially if you're just starting out. Say your name at the beginning of a rap to see how it sounds. If you reference yourself in the flow of your rap, make sure to refer to yourself by your new rapper name. Ensure that it's catchy – something that people will remember.Record yourself and listen over the tapes. If you like the way that it sounds, then keep it. If you don't like the way that it sounds, then try to come up with something else.

, Perhaps there are several aspects of your personality that come through when you rap. Try to stick to one ""stage name"" – but feel free to reference ""characters"" and versions of yourself when you rap. Eminem, for instance, often refers to himself as ""Slim Shady"" to express the rougher, meaner side of his personality., If you're having trouble deciding, ask someone you trust for his or her advice. Ask a friend, a sibling, or another rapper. You don't have to take anybody's advice – but it might help you solidify your own opinion.

, Sometimes, the best way to form an opinion on something is to try it out. You can always change your rapper name if doesn't stick!

"
"
Think of the message you want the song to convey.,
Name the song after the hook.,
Add guest rappers and producers at the end of the song title.,
Name your album after the overall feel of the songs.",How to Come up With a Rap Name2," The title of a song is often the first thing a listener sees, so it needs to do a good job conveying the content of the song Read through the track list of Public Enemy's famous album Fear of a Black Planet, for example, and you know instantly that the songs are protests against a racist society and government (""911 is a Joke,"" ""Power to the People"")


""Rising Down,"" by The Roots, does a fantastic job implying the themes of the song, such as falling into poverty, while contrasting another song later in the album, ""Rising Up.""
""Memory Lane (Sittin' in the Park),"" by Nas reflects on a childhood growing up in Brooklyn.
""Bring Da Ruckus"" by the Wu Tang Clan is about getting the party started, and introducing the raucous group to the world.

, The hook is the part of the song that repeats frequently either in the chorus or the background. Most songs are named after their hooks or a shortened version of the hook, such as Outkast's ""Ms. Jackson,"" Kanye West's ""All Falls Down,"" or Joey Bada$$'s ""World Domination.""


If your song has multiple hooks, choose the one that represents the song best, like Kendrick Lamar's ""The Blacker the Berry,"" a song about race relations in America.

, This is a measure of mutual respect. You need to cite any other rappers who are on a song, such as ""Slow Jamz (ft. Jamie Foxx & Twista)."" While the name of the song is technically just ""Slow Jamz,"" you need to add the featured artists so your listeners know who is rapping.

, Album titles are what bring the CD's themes together. They can be simple, like Lil' Wayne's The Carter, or complex, like Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly. In either case, the title sums up the songs inside of it and gives the album direction.


Albums titles can refer to a rappers style, like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying.

Many rappers have sequential albums, like Kanye West's series College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation, implying that the albums are all linked.
Some albums simply adopt the name of one song, usually the radio hit or the ""thesis,"" of the album, like Common's Be.

"
Pick out a rap song to learn.,
Look up the lyrics.,
Rap along with the song.,
Rap without the music.,
Repeat these steps until you have the lyrics completely memorized.",How to Become a Fast Rapper2," You can select a rap song that is performed at any speed. Sometimes it's best to start out with song that isn't too fast to begin with. Artists like Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent or Biggie have a lot of songs that feature a chill flow which most aspiring rappers can keep up with.

, Read over them several times while you listen to the song. Focus on the lyrics and remembering them perfectly.


Try focusing on the meaning of the lyrics or visualizing the story they tell to help you remember them better., Put the lyrics away and recite them from memory. Try to keep up with the music.

, Recite the lyrics from memory without the help of the music. If you forget the lyrics, start over and try it again. Keep going until you can get through the entire song.

, Rap lyrics should always be recited. Never read the lyrics when performing live or in the studio. Once you can recite rap lyrics from memory, then you can focus on performing the song faster.

"
"
Practice, practice, practice!,
Analyze some techniques of the faster rappers like Tech N9ne, Twista and Eminem.,
Pay attention to the breaks.,
Learn the slang.",How to Become a Fast Rapper3," You need to work on your skills regularly if you want to become a fast rapper. Set aside time daily when you can do tongue twisters and perform rap songs. You can practice for an hour or two, but then give yourself a break to rest your vocal chords. Stay hungry, focused, and committed to improving each day., Notice how certain lines are performed with inflection or tone. It might convey sarcasm, irony, humor. Good rappers will still effectively convey the meaning of their lyrics even when they rap fast. Practice using your voice inflection to convey meaning when rapping fast too.

, Once you learn to rap fast, you need to learn to stop fast. This gives your audience time to process the lyrics. Changing the pace when you perform will not only add style to your performance, it will provide contrast so your fast rapping seems even faster.


Try saying the alphabet as fast as you can, but pause after the letters E, G, and N. This will help you learn to keep going fast when your instincts tell you to pause, and to pause when you normally would keep speaking.

, Rap has a vocabulary all its own. There are many terms you won’t be familiar with unless you study them. If you find a word in rap lyrics you don’t know, look it up in urban dictionary. You might be able to make use of it in the future when creating your own lyrics.

"
"
Use your imagination.,
Memorize your words.,
Develop your own style.",How to Become a Fast Rapper4," The best lyrics transform thoughts into words.Keep your lyrics simple enough for everyone to understand. Listeners should not need a dictionary to understand your songs. Come up with creative rhymes as much as possible.


Great lyrics can combine original imagery with unique thoughts that express your unique views on the world. A good example is this verse from Lil' Wayne.

""I'm probably in the sky flying with the fishes / Or maybe in the ocean swimming with the pigeons / See my World is Different""



, To perform you should know the song forward and backwards. It is impossible to rap very fast when you aren’t certain of the next line. By the time you are ready to perform you should know the lyrics as well as you know your own address or phone number.

, Fast rappers are all unique in their performance and you should be as well. Use your training and knowledge to perform songs that reflect upon your influences in addition to your own unique approach. It’s not just about how fast you are, but how you are fast.


The style of delivery should reflect how you are as person: maybe you're chill, intense or stylish.These attributes should be reflected in your performance.
Perform with confidence, and if you lack confidence, then fake it.If you don't seem confident in your music or yourself, your audience won't buy into your act either. Part of being a great performer is selling the act to the audience.

"
"
Analyze what other rappers are doing.,
Write everything down.,
Look for inspiration in other inherently lyrical art forms.,
Work on your message.,
Practice voice lessons.,
Rap along to your favorites.,
Do diction exercises.,
Practice and then practice some more.,
Listen to yourself.,
Know when material isn’t working.,
Freestyle.,
Get others to help out.",How to Become a Better Rapper," Great artists in any field need to have a working knowledge of the legends who laid the groundwork in the field, as well as the contemporaries currently shaping the industry, and rap is no different. Spend time listening closely to everything from Run DMC to Tupac to local artists around you who haven’t made it big.


Being a connoisseur alone isn’t enough. Break the lyrics and rhythms of your favorite and least favorite songs down into component parts. Ask yourself what succeeds and what fails in every example.
Hold yourself accountable to the same standards you hold other rappers. If you realize that you’re tired of hearing some worn out rhyme in other songs, then you need to avoid that same pitfall yourself, for instance.;
, Think you've got a good idea for a lyric? Write it down where ever you can! Writing down your ideas will help you improve your rap skills since you will have more concepts for raps as well as an ever expanding vocabulary of lyrics.


Poets and other writers regularly keep pocket-size notebooks on them at all times, so they can easily write down great lines before they forget them no matter where they are. If you have a smart phone, plenty of note-taking apps exist as well.
Waiting for inspiration to strike before you write will limit your productivity, so try to make yourself write every day.
Try giving yourself writing assignments. For instance, you can assign yourself thirty minutes or maybe even one verse to write each day. Enlist the help of friends to ask about your daily progress if you don’t think you will pressure yourself enough to do it on your own.

, Rap and hip-hop are essentially poetry with a heightened emphasis on the internal rhythms of the language, so don’t be afraid to look at some modern poetry movements for inspiration.


For example, Saul Williams is an American poet and winner of the Nuyorican Grand Slam Champion prize.He has also worked with Nas, Kanye West, and Jay Z.
The wide array of structure, meter, and other lyrical devices found in poetry may even influence you to try something new to the rap genre that you never would have considered otherwise.

, Plenty of rappers bring a comedic approach to their music, but the time-tested artists usually have something serious to say beneath the jokes. Try to relate to your listeners and rap about things with meaning. Rap about current events, social issues, or even everyday observations.

, Rappers are musicians whose voices are their instruments. Voice lessons will help you with range, melody, and a variety of other singing aspects.

, Just as a guitarist might learn how to play Jimi Hendrix songs to practice skills, you should practice rapping along to some of your favorites to improve your flow and timing.


Don’t pick easy songs or just one artist. Practice a wide range of songs with variations in tempo, rhyme scheme, and song length to exercise several different skills with regard to your singing.
“Alphabet Aerobics” by Blackalicious is a perfect tongue-twisting example to put your flow skills to the test., In addition to rapping along to other songs, try doing other exercises to increase your precision with diction. This page offers a diverse list of tongue twisters to practice, and they even come arranged by letter if you need to work on a specific sound.

, Practice rapping every chance you get, whether it is in your bedroom, outside, or in the car. The more you practice, the better your flow and skills will become. Try rehearsing your own raps in several different styles and at different speeds as well. This is both good practice, and you might stumble upon an unexpected flow as well.

, Record yourself rapping and play it back to see what you are doing right and wrong. This is also a great way to practice different approaches to the same material since it gives you an easy way to compare them afterward.


Previous recordings also give you a way to gauge your progress, which is hard to measure when you work on something every day.

, Sometimes ideas won’t come to fruition in the way you want. In these scenarios, it’s better to set something aside and come back to it later.


This also means knowing when to let go of an idea. Sometimes a project ultimately becomes about salvaging one great line and scrapping the rest, So don’t be afraid to start over.

, Freestyling can greatly help you improve your rap skills. If you can think of a good line on the spot, there's no doubt you can think of a great line in the comfort of your own home.

, Friends and family can listen to your raps and help you improve. You can also go to other aspiring rappers for tips and help.

Put your music on the Internet.",How to Rap," If you want to rap, you've got to immerse yourself in the culture and the sounds of hip-hop music. It's a style of music deeply ingrained in city life and culture. Find an artist you like and trace their influences back to get some sense of the foundation of hip-hop and develop your knowledge of the style. Listen to popular rap artists (e.g Kendrick Lamar, Logic, Eminem and Snoop Dogg), listen to underground artists (e.g R.A. The Rugged Man), listen to old-school rappers (eg. Kurtis Blow, The Sugarhill Gang, LL Cool J), listen to complex rhymers like Nas, Eminem, Big Pun and Rakim.


Listen to the music of different regions: listen to New York-style ""boom-bap"" hip-hop, West Coast gangsta rap, Dirty South chopped-and-screwed rap, and also the hip-hop of the underground. Listen to the music in your region.
Contemporary rap music is linked to mixtape culture.An online version of the old-school mixtapes is available at record stores, most rappers album-quality material is available for free download as a promotional tactic. Check out your favorite rapper's mixtapes and branch out. It's free, so you can listen to stuff you might not even like and form an opinion about it.;
, Rapping is about more than saying something that rhymes. If you want to rap, you'll have to get a feel for the music in your bones. If your brain and body are not conscious and in tune with the beat, your rap will feel stiff and unnatural.When you listen to some rap that you like, try to ignore the words. Just listen to the instrumental, and how the flow of the words seems to fit into the beat.
Consider beatboxing as a tool to learning rhythm—not only will this help you understand rhythm, but it will be a useful technique once you start rapping yourself.

, Memorize the words to your favorite rap song and rap along in your earphones, in your stereo, in your car, etc. Do it loud, and do it with confidence! Try to rap along until you have every word memorized and (more importantly) you can hit all the beats correctly.


See if you can find the instrumental track of the rap song that you've got memorized. If not, find one that's similar. You can download from many websites online. Practice the verses you've memorized over the instrumental beat. Again, do your best to stay on-beat. This will help you learn how to keep a rhythm and tempo.Once you're able to perform the rap song that you've memorized fairly consistently over the instrumental beat, try to adapt it to another beat. Pick one with a different sound and possibly a different tempo. Again, you can find rap beats online in many places. The point here is that you are working on becoming adaptive to the music that you are rapping on.

, Once you have mastered rapping along to a beat, trying rapping the song completely by yourself. If you can do this correctly for many songs, it's safe to say you've mastered rhythm and staying on-beat.


Practice by just reading the lyrics. Then, read the lyrics like you're trying to get a raise from your boss. Try to get it on the beat. Imagine when you are rapping that you are doing it in front of someone you know well and respect. Don't try to make your voice sound like someone you're not. Relax.

, Once you feel comfortable rapping on different beats, start to make up rhymes of your own. No need to worry about what you are rapping about, just pick out things that you see around you. You could even rap about getting dressed in the morning, walking the dog, cooking your dinner, commuting to work, or even about a conversation you had with someone.


Write at least ten rhymes a day. Even if you don't like what you've written, later on you could come back and re-word those rhymes into something you do like. When you finally like what you're hearing, test them in front of your friends and hear what they think. Get a rhyming dictionary to help improve your rhymes, and try to develop your vocabulary by reading as much as you can.
Depending on who you're influenced by, the content of rap songs can differ greatly. Every Lil Wayne song is basically one-liners about the greatness that is Weezy F Baby, while a rapper like Raekwon will tell complicated stories with peppered with flights of sonic wordplay. Try different things and see what feels natural.

, GZA said that ""Wu-Tang"" stood for ""Witty Unpredictable Talent and Natural Game,"" which is as good a description of any as what it is we're looking for in good rap music. To make it second-nature, you've got to rap all the time. Listen to rap music as much as you can, analyze it, and draw inspiration from everything. Successful rapping takes hours and hours of practice, so you should do whatever you can whenever you can.


Make a rap journal. Keep track of your raps, and practice them out of the journal. Carry it everywhere so that when inspiration strikes, you have a place to write your thoughts down. A regret can last a lifetime, don't simply not write down an excellent idea because you think you'll remember it, because the chances are, that you'll probably forget. Jay Z doesn't write his rhymes down and as a result of this, has said he's forgotten entire albums' worth of rhymes.

, Beyond good lyrics and attention to rhythm, there are a few techniques you can use to be better understood and get your message across.


Stress the consonants. If you try to rap the way you talk, it won't be comprehensible.
Keep your words clear. Pay attention to keeping your words sharp.
Rhythm is more important than rhyme. Don't stumble or stop if your freestyle doesn't rhyme—just stay on-beat and everything will be fine.
Be able to think about your next line while still giving 100% to the line you're currently rapping.
Be loud! While being too loud is never a good thing, it's important to both literally and metaphorically be heard.

, Nothing's worse than having to stop in the middle of a rap flow., Even though it's tempting to emulate your favorites, it'll be hard to rap about your global cocaine empire if you're a teenager from the suburbs. You don't necessarily have to tell ""the truth"" 100% of the time, but you do have to be real and be believable.


Figure out what's unique about you, and what you bring to the table of rap. You don't need to have an ingenious or cookie-cutter answer to this question, but don't try to be just like another rapper, even if they're one of the best. In order to do well, you will need to introduce something fresh to the industry.

, Poet Allen Ginsberg once said, ""First thought, best thought."" Start with a line you've already written and then go straight off the dome: if you're becoming proficient at rhyming quickly, doing it on the fly can be a way to open up your skills and surprise yourself with what you come up with.


Supposedly Lil Wayne never writes rhymes and just raps this way, by listening to the beat and diving right in.

, To make truly original music, start developing your own beats to work with. This will free you up to make the kinds of beats you want to make, use the kinds of samples and sounds you like, and surprise people with completely original sounds.


Alternatively, you can hook up with a producer who's eager to share beats. It could lead to a fruitful relationship.

, Find some people who also like to rap and take turns making raps together. It's easier to get creative when you can get inspired and feed off of somebody else's flow. Give yourselves pseudonyms and adopt a crew name.The Wu-Tang Clan did this to showcase individual talents and share resources.

, Be proactive about finding gigs and showing yourself off. Start small—perform to little groups of your peers and get feedback. When you feel comfortable with that, start looking around for open mics where you can perform.



Freestyle battles are a unique opportunity in hip-hop and can be a good way of making connections, but only if you've really honed your freestyle skills and are familiar with the conventions of a freestyle battle. It can seem confrontational and mean, since it involves lots of crude disses, so go check some out before you decide to sign up.

, Hook up with a producer or another rapper who's got some recording equipment and get yourself recorded. With original beats, write new rhymes and keep the best of it. Be judicious in deciding--it can be tempting to like the first stuff you make too much, because it sounds ""real."" Make sure it's something you'll actually enjoy listening to.


Try recording yourself. Increasingly, the recording technology on home computers and smartphones is high quality. It's always better to use real equipment, but in the beginning do it yourself.

, Once you've got some good recordings of yourself rapping, start to cultivate an online presence for your music. Start a YouTube channel for your music and try to get a mixtape released. Put it out there for free and see what happens. Chicago rapper Chief Keef signed a several-million dollar deal based on the strength of a single mixtape and a few YouTube videos that had become very popular.

Wear a a lot of bling but not too much that it looks like you bought 20 for £1 or $1. Or you could go for the sporty look and wear all the latest sports clothes. Look fierce and sexy in your body. Do some research and associate your style to your raps. EG. No pinky, girly, sugar bunny clothes if all your raps have you swearing like a soldier with a rude undertone.

, You can make your eyes a masterpiece but the rest of your face should then be simple and not over done. go for what makes you look hot but not like a hooker.

The ability to write an effective battle rhyme will aid you when it comes to the battle. (Note: Some rappers don't write everything down, they keep everything in their head so that they can only talk about what's “real.”) Don't try to force rhymes all the time, though. Just let it come naturally and try your best.

, Jazz and rap may seem very different, but jazz musicians that improvise in their performances use their brains similar to rappers when they freestyle.Both jazz musicians and rappers learn to shut down parts of their brain that can be distracting.

, Sports and rap may be completely unrelated, but a sport like basketball requires a lot of improvised movement that will help to further train your brain and help your performance. Sports can help your brain learn to flip a switch and get ""in the zone."" This is an important technique to learn to block out distractions and perform under pressure when your moment arrives., Rapping without pre-written lyrics on the spot or impromptu should be done anytime, anywhere, as much as you can. While you’re at it, practice freestyling battle rhymes. Even if it means looking at a photo, thinking about an ex, or imagining a future opponent, do whatever you can to come up with clever new ways to insult. Whenever you think you’ve run out of things to freestyle about, just keep going; the longer you force yourself to rap without giving up, the stronger and more flexible you'll become mentally.

, In between each round of a rap battle you will have a few minutes while your opponent takes their turn. Make the most of your time by figuring out your ideas and how to organize them in your next verse.


Figure out which line is your best. You may choose to lead with this or save it until the end. Learning how to highlight your best disses will make them stand out and be more memorable and help to win over the audience.

, Don't come at every opponent or rap battle the same. Figure out the best method to take down your opponent before you go on the stage. By doing your homework and studying the competition, you can find weaknesses to exploit.


Read the Art of War by Sun Tzu.For years, businessmen and women have read the Art of War to develop their strategic thinking and be successful. The same methods can help you to battle better, too.
You may choose to go after your opponent right away, or just diffuse any attacks you may think they are planning to come at you with. Self-criticism can be very unexpected for the opponent that comes after your flaws. In 8 Mile's final battle, for example, B-Rabbit was put to spit first and decided to insult himself before Papa Doc got a chance (Yes, I'm white, yeah I am a bum, I do live in a trailer wit my mom, my boy future is an ""Uncle Tom""...So what?), leaving Papa nothing to retaliate with.

, If your opponent is dead serious, humor can be especially deadly. Getting the audience to laugh at an opponent is a great way to deflate their intensity – especially if (s)he ends up cracking up too. If you can get your opponent to agree with you during your battle verse, you are making great strides towards a win.


Use similes and metaphors. Making comparisons with your opponent to something that insults them. Try to link it with something going on in the world at the moment that everyone is familiar with.
You want to diss your opponent whenever possible. You can knock how they dress, speak, spit, look, walk, talk, and act, as well as their personal life as in their past, lifestyle, and other personal weaknesses.

, You can find ways to incorporate ordinary objects to devastate your opponent. For example, if you come up with a line about making your opponent cry, you can offer them a tissue.


Observe your surroundings.You may find items that can be of use during performance. Maybe a snack or some popcorn you can offer your opponent. Or, you may notice an article of clothing on your opponent to make a crack about during your next rhyme.

, The best way to start battling is to find opponents just for fun. Have rap battles with friends that don't care if you insult them – or mess up, for that matter. Battle as often as you can, especially if you can find a friend who is actually good at it and can help you improve. Once you’re confident that you’re good at it, try your skills at house parties and rap concerts, which are also good places to practice your techniques before actually entering a stage battle.

, Staying calm will not only help you keep your cool while your opponent disses you, but also allow you to focus on coming up with a good response. Not only that, but keeping calm will improve your delivery, which can make or break an insult: since the hallmark of good delivery is timing, allowing your mind (and mouth) to race in panic can cripple the best diss.


Breathe deeply. Deep breathing stimulates the Vagus nerve, which has a calming effect on the body and mind.In fact, some researchers believe that making a habit of relaxing and breathing deeply can change the way that your genes express themselves, making you calmer person all around., Don't just stand there and talk. Move around. Gesture with your hands to emphasize your lyrics.


Aggression is a must.Performing with intensity will engage the crowd and win them over. Many times rap battles are determined by which performer is stronger at commanding the stage.

, These words will help you out if you’re drawing blanks. Know what words rhyme with your key words, allowing you to use them more often because you know what flows with them.


Write down lists of rhyming words that can be easily used to knock your opponent in someway. For example, joke rhymes with broke, choke, etc. Keep the lists in a notebook and practice using them in some of your rhymes. Just knowing a few such words can give you dozens of verses to throw out there if you're struggling to come up with other ideas.

, The point is to constantly practice freestyling and performing better. Just like with athletes and musicians, you need to put the work in during practice to reach your full potential when the moment comes. The longer you do it the better you'll become, so keep it up till you've got it down.

Adapt this skill.",How to Beatbox," To get started, you should master the three basic sounds of beatboxing: the classic kick drum {b}, the hi-hat {t}, and the classic snare drum {p} or {pf}. Practice combining the sounds into an 8-beat rhythm like this: { b t pf t / b t pf t } or { b t pf t / b b pf t }. Make sure to get the timing right. Start off slowly and build up speed later.
, The simplest way to make the classic kick drum is to say the letter ""b."" To make it sound louder and punchier, you need to do what is called a lip oscillation. This is where you let air vibrate through your lips - a bit like ""blowing a raspberry."" Once you can do this, you make a very short lip oscillation.


Make the b sound as if you are saying b from the word bogus.
This time, with your lips closed, let the pressure build up.
You need to control the release of you lips just enough to let them vibrate for a short amount of time.

, Make a simple ""ts"" sound but have your teeth closed or lightly closed. Move the tip of your tongue forward behind your front teeth for a thin hat sound and to the traditional t position for a heavy hat sound.


Breathe out for longer to create the open hat sound.

, You can also do successive hi-hats by making a ""tktktktk"" sound, using the mid-back of your tongue to make the ""k"" sound. You can make an open hi-hat sound by drawing out the breath in the ""ts"" hi-hat, so it's more like ""tssss"" for a more realistic open door sound. Another way of producing a realistic high-hat sound is to make a ""ts"" sound with your teeth clenched., The simplest way of making a classic snare sound is to say the letter 'p.' However, making a 'p' sound is too quiet. To make it louder you can do several things: the first is to make a lip oscillation. This is where you push the air out of your lips making them vibrate. The second is where you breathe out at the same time making a sound.


To make the 'p' sound more interesting and more snare-like, most beatboxers add a second fricative (continuous) sound to the initial 'p' sound: pf ps psh bk.
The variation {pf} is similar to the bass drum, only you use the very front of your lips instead of the side, and you tighten them more.
Pull your lips in a bit so that your lips are sort of hidden, as if you had no teeth.
Build up a little air pressure behind the hidden lips.
Swing your lips out (not literally swing) and just before they return to their normal position (un-hidden), release the air with a 'p' sound.
Immediately after you release the air and get the 'p' sound out, tighten your bottom lip up against your bottom teeth to make a ""fff"" sound.

, After mastering the three basic beatbox sounds, it's time to move onto these intermediate techniques. These might be a little more difficult, but practice makes perfect., This is done by pressing your lips together and building up pressure with your tongue and jaw, pushing your tongue forward from the back of your mouth and closing your opened jaw at the same time. Let your lips part toward the side for just a moment so the air can escape, and it should make a bass drum sound. You want to add pressure with your lungs, but not so much that you have an airy sound afterward.


If you're not making enough bass sound, you need to relax your lips a bit. If your sound isn't making a bass drum sound at all, you need to tighten your lips, or make sure that you're doing it off to the side of your lips.
Another way to approach it is to say ""puh."" Then, take off the ""uh"" so that all you hear is the initial attack on the word, so that it comes out like a little puff. Try your hardest to not let any of the ""uh"" sound come out, and also try to not have any breathy sound or air noise with it.
Once you feel comfortable with that, you can slightly tighten your lips and force a larger amount of air through your lips to make a bigger sounding kick drum.

, Bring your tongue to the back of your mouth and build up pressure with your tongue or lungs. Use your tongue if you're looking for speed, or use your lungs if you want to breathe in at the same time as you make the sound.


Try saying ""pff,"" making the ""f's"" stop just a millisecond or so after the ""p."" Lifting the corners of your mouth and holding your lips really tight when making the initial ""p"" will help it sound more realistic. You can also use the same technique to change the apparent pitch of the snare.

, First say ""ish."" Then, try saying ""ish"" without adding the ""sh"" at the end, again going only for the initial attack. Make it very staccato (short), and you should get a sort of grunt in the back of your throat. Push a little bit when you say it, so that it has a big, accented attack.


Once you're comfortable with that, add the ""sh"" on the end and you'll get a synth-like snare sound. You can also work on moving the grunt so that it feels like it's coming from the top of your throat, for a higher drum sound, or so that it feels more like it's coming out of the lower part of your throat, for a lower drum sound.

, This is one of the easier sounds to make. Whisper (don't say) the syllable ""chish."" Then, do it again, but this time clench your teeth and take the vowel out, going from ""ch"" straight to ""sh"" without little or no transition, and you'll have a basic crash cymbal.

, Place the tip of your tongue so that it touches the place where your top teeth meet your palate. Keeping your lips about a half-inch apart, breathe in forcefully through your mouth. Notice how the air blows past your teeth and tongue and makes a sort of small rushing sound. Then, breathe in forcefully again, and this time close your lips as your breathing in; they should sort of feel like they're popping closed, without making a popping sound.

, You would be surprised at the number of human beatboxers who pass out because they forget that their lungs need oxygen. You may want to start by incorporating your breath into the beat. Eventually you will gain a great deal of lung capacity throughout your practice.


An intermediate technique is to breathe in during a tongue snare, since it requires the least amount of lung capacity. An expert will have slowly practiced breathing whilst beatboxing each sound independently (see previous step), thus separating their breathing from the beat, allowing several kinds of bass sounds, snare sounds, and even some hi-hat sounds to continue without pause.
As an alternative to breathing exercises, there are many sounds that can be done breathing inwards such as variations on the snare and handclap sounds.

, One thing that puzzles people is how beatboxers can beatbox for a long time without actually taking a breath. Well, the answer is to make a sound and breathe in at the same time! We call these inward sounds. What is more, as you'll discover, some of the best sounds are made like this.


There are many ways of making inward sounds. Nearly every sound that can be made outward can be made inward - although it may take some practice to get it right.

, Microphone technique is very important for performing or if you just want to enhance the sound made by your mouth. And there are different ways of holding the microphone. While you can just hold the mic as you would while singing, some beatboxers find that putting the mic between your ring and middle fingers and then gripping it with your first two fingers on top of the bulb and your thumb at the bottom results in a cleaner, more crisp sound.


Try not to breathe into the mic while you beatbox.
Many beatboxers deliver a poor performances because they hold the microphone incorrectly and thus they fail to maximize the power and clarity of the sounds they produce.

, Once you've acquired basic and intermediate skills, it's time to learn some advanced techniques. Don't worry if you have trouble picking them up right away. With practice, you'll be able to do all of them eventually., This should be used in place of a bass drum. It takes about 1/2-1 beat to perform. To do a sweeping bass drum, start out like you're about to do a bass drum. Then let your lips loose so they flap when you push air past them. Then touch the tip of your tongue to the inside gum of your bottom teeth and push it forward to perform the technique.

, This is done by making an ""oof"" sound, as if you've just been hit in the stomach. Do it while keeping your mouth closed. You should be able to feel it in your chest.

, This is done the same way as the Techno Bass, but position your mouth as if you were going to make a ""shh"" sound. You'll still get the bass sound underneath.

, This is done by reversing the airflow of any of the previous techniques. A commonly misunderstood technique, scratching involves different tongue and lip movements depending on the instrument you are trying to ""scratch"" with. To understand better, record yourself laying down a beat. Then using a music program, like Windows Sound Recorder, listen to it in reverse.


Learning to emulate those reversed sounds literally doubles your known techniques. Also, try making the sound, and then its reverse immediately afterward (Ex: A bass sound followed by its reverse in quick succession make the standard ""scratch"" noise).
Crab scratch:

Put your thumb up. Open your hand up and put your fingers 90 degrees to the left.
Make your lips tight. Put your hand on your lips with your lips out them right near the crack of your thumb.
Suck in air. It should make a warp sound like a DJ.



, Lightly blow out through your mouth while trying to sustain the letter ""f."" By blowing slightly harder on the beats 2 and 4, you'll have the accents.

, Whisper the word ""kaw,"" then say it again without letting any of the ""aw"" through. Push on the ""k"" a little harder and you'll get a rimshot.

, This is a very difficult technique to perform at first, but once you know how, you can use it any time. To start, position your tongue so that the right (or left, depending on preference) side is resting right above where your top teeth meet your gum. Then pull the back of your tongue toward the back of your throat to do a click roll., This technique isn't as difficult as singing, but when you're just starting off, it is easy to get lost. To start, you must first realize that there are two ways to hum: one is from the throat (say ""ahh"") and the other is through the nose (""mmmmmm""), which is considerably harder to get used to but immeasurably more versatile.


The key to humming and beatboxing at the same time is to start with a baseline or melody in mind. Listen to rap hooks, whether they be hummed or not (For example, listen to Parliament Funkadelic's ""Flashlight"" and practice humming the melody, then try beatboxing over top of it; James Brown is also great for melodies).
Scour your music collection for baselines and melodies to hum, then try to put some of your beats or someone else's beats over top of it. It is necessary to learn how to hum a melody or baseline for several reasons, especially if you plan to learn to start singing. This is the area of beatboxing that takes some originality!
If you've tried to beatbox and hum at the same time, you must have realized that you've lost of some of your proficiency with certain beat techniques (the Techno Bass and Techno Snare are severely limited, as well as the click roll becomes, if not totally unusable, very hard to hear). Learning what works takes time and practice.
If you ever find yourself in a beatbox battle, don't forget that while your endurance and speed are important, using new and interesting melodies and baselines will always win the crowd.

, This is an advanced technique which is not widely used in the realm of beatboxing. There are several resources available on how to sing/hum inward. For the purposes of beatboxing, when you need to breathe really bad, it may be a good idea to hum inward. You can always continue humming the same melody, but the pitch (note) will change drastically.


With practice, you can correct this pitch change to some extent, but many beatboxing experts who use inward humming decide to change the melody when switching from outward humming to inward humming.

, Hum falsetto (that's high pitched - like Mickey Mouse). Now, lift the back of your tongue to make the sound thinner and sharper. Add a loose, lip oscillation (classic kick drum) to the front of each note. Then close your eyes, let rip and pretend you are Louis Armstrong!

, The key is to line up consonant sounds with the bass and vowel sounds with the snare. Don't bother adding a hi-hat, as even the best beatboxers have trouble in that respect.

, Singing and beatboxing at the same time may seem like an impossible task (especially at first). But it's actually quite easy. Below is a working sample that will help you get started. You can use this basic technique and later adapt it to any song.

(b)if your (pff)mother (b)(b)on(b)(pff)ly knew(b)knew(pff) (""If Your Mother Only Knew"" by Rahzel).

, Listen to the song you want to beatbox to a few times to find out where the beat goes. In the example above, the beats are marked out.

, This will help you get comfortable with the song.

, Most songs will have the beat in front of the words. In this case:


""If"" - Since the word ""if"" in our example starts with a vowel, it is easy to fit in the bass just before it, as though you were saying ""bif."" Note however, that the ""b"" must be low and if necessary, separate the beats from the words a little when you first start.
""Mother"" - The word ""mother"" starts with a consonant. In this case, you could drop the ""m"" and substitute it with the ""pff"" since they sound quite close when said together quickly. Or, you could stagger the word just a little so that the beat comes first, and the lyric slightly delayed. If you choose the first, you will end up singing ""pffother."" Notice that your top teeth contact your lower lip, which is what creates the m-like sound. If you can manipulate this, it will sound a lot better.
""On"" - For the double beat on ""on,"" you can hum the pitch while doing ""b-b-on,"" then come in straight away with ""b pff-ly knew,"" all the while humming the pitch. For the ""on,"" you might find that the sound breaks if you do the second bass beat. To remedy this, hum through your nose. This can be done simply by pushing the back of your tongue up to close off against your soft upper palate. This hum now comes out through your nose, and is not interrupted by what you do with your mouth.
""Knew"" - The word ""knew"" echoes and fades off.

, These steps can be adapted for any song with a beat. Keep practicing, with different songs and soon you will be able to ad-lib more easily.

, Hiss like a snake and try to do it from your diaphragm. Try doing this as long as you can or until you run out of air.

, Practice letting out a little bit of breath at a time. At first, it'll sound like you're grunting, as you breathe in push your stomach out to have more air for belting a note.

, Keep trying different methods of letting the air out. You don't want to release too much air, or you'll be off no use on stage.

, To distort the scream, just do like when you burp, but without burping; just pushing air constantly through the throat.

, Use your diaphragm, and feel where your throat is straining to control the pitch. The wider your mouth, the easier it is to scream high. The more round you make your mouth, the easier the lows come.

, The best way to learn is to scream harmonies with your favorite bands. I say harmonies because you won't sound like other screamers yet, especially not good ones. If you're screaming harmonies, you can hear your own voice and learn how without getting discouraged because you don't match the lead singer's voice.

Listen to any singer who screams.,
Drink something warm.,
Whisper the ""ah"" sound.Force out a lot of air as you whisper, but make sure that you can retain enough air to sustain the sound for 15 to 30 seconds.,
Close your throat and apply more force.,
Practice.",How to Scream1," Imitation is often the quickest way to learn the basics of something, and screaming is no exception. Try to find a singer who does not scream his or her entire vocals. Instead, when learning how to master this, try listening to a song where there's a scream within the song, but doesn't scream all the lyrics.


As you practice your own scream, you can vary the style to suit your voice and image as desired. For now, however, focus simply on producing the basic sound and worry about tailoring it to your own tastes later on.;
, Screaming will be much less harsh on your throat if you moisten your throat first. Something lukewarm or warm is preferably to something cold, since warm fluids can soothe the throat while cold fluids can cause the muscles to tighten and ultimately feel more sore.


Warm tea with honey is one of the best options, but you could also settle for lukewarm water or room temperature juice.
Avoid cold drinks.
Stay away from drinks containing caffeine or alcohol, since these will only dry out your throat more.

,


Take a deep breathe through your nose before you begin to get as much air into your lungs as possible. The more air you start with, the longer you can sustain the sound.
Breathe out from the diaphragm. The air should be forced up from the bottom of your lungs, and you should force it out in a controlled, steady stream instead of letting it loose all at once.

, Narrow your throat so that there is only a small gap for you to force air through. Apply more energy to your ""ah"" until you can eventually feel the sound between your throat and chest.


Your throat should be as tightly closed together as it can be while still allowing air to flow through.

, If you take your time, it could take several weeks of consistent practice before you master this scream. You should still practice this slowly to avoid ruining your throat, though.


If your throat begins to hurt as you practice your screaming, stop immediately and drink something warm. Warm tea with honey is especially good at this point.
Only continue with your practice when your throat feels completely fine.

Pushing your voice beyond what it is ready to do can lead to swelling and even damage, much like an athlete stands a much greater chance of injury when forgoing a pre-game warm-up.There are many warm ups you might use, including:


Regular scales at two octave intervals. Sing regular intervals from low in your range up two octaves and back down again. You can check your intervals by playing along with a piano; each white note step is corresponds with a one-interval step.
Sing trills. This will warm up the muscles of your tongue and lips. Simple sing or hum a tone while you trill your tongue or lips. For your tongue, this will be a rolled sound like the 't' in 'water' or a Spanish 'rr.' Lip trills are like blowing a raspberry.
Siren up and down. Use a vowel to gently ascend from your lower range all the way up to the your upper limits. Then descend in a controlled fashion, as smoothly as possible.;
, While a certain level of fatigue is normal when training your voice to sing a broader range or in a different fashion, as you are in scream-singing, you should listen to your body. If you feel pain, irritation, a burning sensation, or notice uncharacteristic changes to your voice, stop immediately.


Pushing your voice can result in permanent damage.
Long periods of rest can cure fatigue and minor strain., The strain you put on your voice while training it to scream-sing can lead to hoarseness and discomfort, but the same sensations can come about from normal intensive vocal practice.You should break up your practice sessions so that you're not overly straining your voice and doing potential damage to it.


Hydration is important for the health of your vocal folds. Use breaks to grab a drink of warm water or tea.
Beginning singers will want to limit singing to about 20 minutes per day. With experience will come greater vocal strength which will translate to more practice time throughout the day.
Even advanced singers should limit practice to several 15 - 20 minute segments. Each segment should start with a warm up, end with a cool down, and be followed by rest, and hydration., Serious singers will probably want to get a pre-evaluation from a medical expert to address an avoidable issues before they can cause damage. Some doctors specialize in treating the pathologies common to vocalists, including vocal fold swelling, nodules on the vocal folds, and hemorrhages. If one of these specialists is not available in your area, you should seek out an ears, nose, and throat doctor, explain your situation, and ask him to evaluate the condition of your voice.


You should also see a vocal professional if you experience vocal discomfort or an uncharacteristic change in your voice for an extended period of time.
A laryngoscopy is a procedure frequently performed on professional vocalists, where a small camera is used to inspect the condition of the vocal apparatus., A voice coach will have the experience to recognize production errors on your part when you try to scream-sing. This will allow you and your coach to isolate problem areas and protect your voice from overexertion and damage. Some experts even specialize in teaching scream-singing.


You might look for a voice coach in the music department of at a local university.
Seek out a voice coach at a local music school or institute.
As a more affordable option, you might make use of video coaching. Some voice coaches provide pre-recorded videos for a fee, including helpful techniques on these recordings., There are four main parts of your body that you'll need to coordinate to properly scream-sing and save your voice from damage. Your mouth, your throat/pharynx, your chest, and your diaphragm. While screaming, each of these parts have ""jobs"".


The diaphragm is a band of muscle that stretches across the bottom of your rib cage. It acts like a bellows, drawing down to pull air into your lungs or pulling up to press air out., Your mouth will releases the sound and form your scream into words. Your mouth should be opened as wide as possible. Avoid distorting the sound with your mouth, as this will add strain to your vocal tract and can result in you hurting your throat., The throat has one purpose and one purpose only: to create the tone. It must be as open as possible. Refrain from adding distortion to your tone from the throat by constricting the muscles there.Get a feel for the open throat you'll need for your scream-singing by yawning. The upward shift of the back, upper regions of your throat is your soft palate raising.
Your tongue should also be flat and somewhat retracted to improve the openness of your throat.
Try breathing in on a 'k' sound. This will cause a greater space between the back regions of your tongue and your soft palate, helping you to feel the ideal shape for your throat., Relax the muscles in the top of your chest, open your mouth wide, and breathe. That is the feeling you want in your throat while screaming. If you feel a ""trapped"" sensation, or feel a kind of blockage or lack of airflow, immediately stop., The chest will be where the distortion of your scream comes from. This is the location where the windpipe is strongest. Therefore, this is where you want to constrict the sound.A trick you might use to constrict the sound in your chest is to place your hands on your chest and push inwards while keeping your posture straight.

, When you are talking normally the air comes from your chest. To scream, you want the air to come from your diaphragm. All the force of your scream should originate and be sustained with your diaphragm., The force/sustaining of your diaphragm will flex, releasing air to create sound that gets will be constricted and distorted in your chest. This scream should then pass through your open throat and out your mouth, which should also be wide open.

, As you perfect your technique and strengthen your voice for this kind of singing, you'll be able to increase the volume you produce, but even a well-trained voice can be strained by scream-singing too loudly. You should make use of microphones to prevent singing too loud and plan to take plenty of breaks to prevent overuse., Vocal fry, also called the pharyngeal voice, is a tone of voice in your lower register. Vocal fry creates crackle and creakiness commonly associated the pop and sizzle of scream-singing. While speaking or singing with vocal fry for extended periods can be bad for you, at low volumes with a mic up close, this technique can actually save your voice from serious damage that can be caused by a full-on scream.Female vocalists attempting to accomplish this technique should practice by aiming for a tone at around B♭4, or middle the B♭ above middle C on a keyboard.
Male vocalists can practice this kind of voice by singing lower in the register, at about the range of D4 - E♭4, or the D - E♭ above middle C on a keyboard., You can also take your recording with you to vocal lessons, if you have a voice coach, and receive critique to improve your scream-singing. Each voice is different; you'll need to familiarize yourself with vocal tension and make small adjustments to tweak your voice to achieve the sound you're aiming to produce., Warm liquids will sooth your voice, relaxing it from the tension and strain that have likely built up over the course of your vocal practice. Tea is frequently recommended by vocalists and voice professionals alike.You may also benefit from the foul smelling vocal elixir, propolis, a drink made from bees wax.


Another technique, steaming, can be used to improve your vocal healing. Boil water in a pot, drape a towel over your head, and use the towel to collect the steam and breath it in. Be careful not to put your head to close to the boiling water, or you may get scalded.
Add a few drops of Eucalyptus essential oil to your water when steaming to improve the healing effects of your steam treatment., This will sooth your throat and reduce swelling in your vocal folds. You may want to do this as frequently as once an hour by dissolving 1 tsp (5 g) of salt in 8 oz (240 mL) glass of warm water. Frequent gargling can also be a preventative measure for throat soreness and vocal fold swelling., Some throat sprays are formulated expressly with vocalists in mind. These do not have numbing agents, which can cause you to push your voice harder or further than is healthy. Two common sprays popular among vocalists include Entertainer's Secret and Vocalise., Once you are finished, you may feel slight tightness, or notice a ""tired"" quality to your voice. This is similar to the sore muscles that athletes get while strength training. You can reduce this quality by humming to cool down your voice. Simply:


Choose a low, comfortable note.
Gently hum as clear a note as possible., Port is a fortified red wine that is strong and sweet.For younger vocalists, this will not be a legal option, but adults might use a glass to ease sore throats and help with vocal recovery.


Generally speaking, alcoholic drinks are dehydrating and negatively impact vocal production. Port is generally accepted as an exception to this rule."

You should know what your voice range is (baritone, tenor, contralto, mezzo soprano, etc).,
Warm up.,
When you first start learning, you're going to be making a lot of dodgy noises.,
Use your diaphragm correctly!,
When you are first learning to scream and do not know how to use your diaphragm, flex your abdominals, kind of like you're about to take a punch.,
All you have to do from there, is repeatedly (over the course of many weeks), raise and lower pitch.,
The more air you push out, the higher in pitch your screams will be.,
It is MOST likely that it will hurt at first, but after a while you will learn how to do this correctly.,
To attain a different pitch use your diaphragm, tongue position and the shape of your mouth... lows for eg - lower your tongue open your mouth wide.,
For future reference, in most of the music that you might be trying to imitate, they use distortion effects in the studio or auto tune to make a deeper and fuller pitch.

,
It's just as bad for you as exhale screaming (if done improperly).",How to Properly Stress Your Vocal Chords With Screaming," If you don't already know, then search for info on the different voice ranges. Find an instrument you can sing along to, such as a guitar or piano, find middle C (256 Hz), and figure out what range you fit in to.

, Every good metal screamer does a warm-up at some time of the day before a performance. This is not a screaming warm-up, it's a singing warm-up. People like Randy Blythe of Lamb of God, Byron Davis of God Forbid, and Phil Labonte of All That Remains, all practice conventional singing warm-up exercises before a performance; the same fundamental exercises that you would do before choir practice. This is very important for your voice so don't be lazy and skip it. Find a singing warm-up routine, like singing the vowels--Eh, Ee, Ah, Oh, Oo--over a 5-note scale.

, Like little cat growls and trying to speak like Marge Simpson. It's important that you create your scratchy sounds from the nasal region in the back, above your throat, not low in your throat. If you make the sound from low in your throat, you will be teaching yourself to do it wrong and learning a method that will hurt you. Try to feel the difference between the Marge voice and the low-in-the-throat, gargle-like noise. You should be able to create the Marge voice without hurting yourself. Use these two points of reference as you're learning. Remember to keep your scratchy sounds coming from higher up (the nasal region) so you don't damage your voice. If you're doing it wrong, it will hurt. Practice intelligently. You will probably be screaming wrong in the beginning, so save your voice until you figure out how to do it right.

, Don't hold the air in your chest! You should breath in and fill your stomach, not your chest.

, After you do that, talk a little bit, if you get a raspy sound coming out, you are talking correctly.

, Also after a long time of practice as to where you can get different pitches, try pushing out more air.

, When performing high exhale screams, open your mouth as wide as possible and scream while flexing the diaphragm.

, If, however, it continues to hurt and/or bleeds, you are doing it wrong.

, For highs, raise your tongue high and allow the scream to hit the top of your throat.

,, If you master both, alternating can give different vocal chords a chance to rest.

Drink something warm.,
Form your mouth into an ""e"" shape.,
Close your throat tight.,
Inhale deeply.,
Practice.",How to Scream2," You can maintain a sound much more clearly and protect your throat much better if you make sure that your throat is moist before you begin. Lukewarm and warm beverages tend to be better for your throat than cold fluids.


Warm tea with honey is one of the best options, but you could also settle for lukewarm water or room temperature juice.
Avoid cold drinks.
Stay away from drinks containing caffeine or alcohol, since these will only dry out your throat more.

, Form your mouth as though you intend to make the long ""eee"" sound. You do not need to actually make the sound, though.


The “ee” sound is the same as the “ee” in “feet.”
Exhale gently before the next part. This screaming technique produces sound on the inhale, so your lungs need to be emptied out for you to make it.

, Close your throat so that only a small gap exists for you to push air through. Essentially, you should try to make this gap as small as you possibly can while still producing a sound from it.


Move your tongue close to the roof of your mouth as you do this, but do not let it touch the roof. Moving your tongue in this manner should make it easier to tightly narrow your airway.

, Put a great deal of energy into the inhale, activating your vocal chords as you go. You should end up producing in inhale scream or pterodactyl scream.


Note that, as with the basic scream method outlined here, this method will only produce a single scream within the course of a song. You will not be able to use it to sing the lyrics of an entire song.

, You will probably need to practice for several weeks at a consistent yet gradual pace before you can perform this scream correctly.


Note that this technique can be more difficult to master than a basic scream, and not everyone will be able to master it. If you still cannot get the hang of it after several weeks, you would be better off sticking with a more traditional scream.
An inhaled scream like this should not cause your throat to get sore like an exhaled scream will, but it is still a good idea to take breaks in between practices and drink warm tea with honey, or another warm drink, to soothe your throat.

"
"
Sing the ""ah"" sound in falsetto.,
Sustain the note for as long as you can comfortably do so.,
Gargle a sip of water as you make the ""ah"" sound.,
Change to the ""oo"" sound.,
Switch back to the ""ah"" sound but use the new technique.,
Practice.",How to Scream3," Pick a note you can sustain easily, but opt for one that is high enough to fall within your falsetto range. The pitch should be the highest one you can sing in while sustaining it without tension.


Falsetto screaming is usually easier to learn than screams done in your normal vocal range.
With this technique, you can learn to insert individual screams into songs or scream out lyrics.
To help yourself with this step, consider playing the note you sing on a pitch wheel, keyboard, or guitar.
There should be absolutely no tension on this note. If you have to push yourself to make and sustain it, drop down a pitch further and try again.

, Once you figure out which pitch to go with, attempt to sing it out for as long as you possibly can without straining your throat. Ideally, you should aim to hold it for 30 seconds.


Keep practicing until you can hold this pitch steady for the full 30 seconds. Holding it steady means that there should be no cracking, wavering, or other variances in pitch or tonal quality.

, Take a sip of lukewarm water, but instead of swallowing, begin to gargle it while making the same ""ah"" sound as you made earlier. Keep the same note and pitch.


Pay close attention to the vibration of the uvula. The uvula is the piece of flesh hanging down from the back of your mouth.
This vibration will be what you will rely on when creating a raspy scream voice.
Continue gargling on the ""ah"" sound until you can commit this vibration to memory and feel comfortable with it.

, Essentially, you will be trying to create the same sound you made while gargling the water without actually gargling water anymore. Make the ""oo"" sound while directing air toward the soft palate of your mouth. The breath pressure should be directly applied to the top middle part of your mouth.


This is the same ""oo"" sound as the ""o"" in ""shoe.""
The soft palate is the soft tissue found at the roof of your mouth.
This action should cause the uvula to vibrate as it did before. The resulting sound should be similar to the coo of a pigeon.
Make sure that this is sung in the same pitch as before, and that you can sustain it for 30 seconds without the sound becoming uneven.
This technique teaches you to place your tone in the soft palate, which is essential if you want to safely sustain a long scream in a song.

, Sing the ""ah"" sound in the same pitch and on the same note as before, making sure that the note is still consistent. Direct more air toward the soft palate to activate the uvula, creating a distorted ""scream"" note.


You can direct as much air to the palate as you want as long as it does not result in straining.
Manipulate your tongue, throat, and breathing using this same technique to produce different vowels, consonants, and sounds.

, You will need to practice a little at a time over the course of a couple of weeks before you can really master this scream. Take your time to avoid damaging your throat.


If you take your time, it could take several weeks of consistent practice before you master this scream. You should still practice this slowly to avoid ruining your throat, though.
If your throat starts hurting as you practice, stop and drink something warm. Warm tea with honey is especially good at this point. Only continue with your practice when your throat feels completely fine.
With enough practice, you should be able to create raspy, screaming tones without relying on the uvula. You should also be able to apply this technique to the rest of your vocal range, instead of only your falsetto voice.

Make sure you don’t run out of breath and inhale deeply at the start of every line.,
Practice.,
Before a gig for a period of two weeks eating nothing but red meat as rare as you can stand it, washed down with plenty of absinthe for lyrical inspiration.

,
Don't mind the mucous.,
Master the art of screaming.,
The importance of being evil.,
Choose an intimidating name.,
Black pajamas.,
Write the lyrics.,
Design a logo.,
Forget the idea that to be true black metal you have to be 15 years old, permanently frowning, Norwegian, and your albums have to sound like they were recorded in a paint can by wasps, and under no circumstances can you have keyboards or anything resembling a melody.,
Recruit a band.,
Burn out rather than fade away.",How to Succeed at Black Metal," For death metal style vocalization, breathing plays a greater role in determining the pitch and volume of your voice than in black metal because it is generally much more guttural and lower in pitch. In black metal it is only really the screaming that requires much breath control, the actual sound of black metal vocals is much more individual than in death metal and words are generally easy to decipher.;
, The more you do anything the easier it gets. The best way to do this is to try singing along to as many different bands as you can, to get a varied practice routine.


Make sure you can hear yourself to see where you may be going wrong, don’t drown yourself out or become overly confident.

,, It can only help you sound more inhuman and can add an air of depravity that really helps the sound. But if it is impairing your voice don’t drink acid just spit it or use Chest Congestion Liquid to cough it up.

, No good black metal vocalist would dare take the mike without being able to start every other song with a long and blood-curdling scream. Many of us since the start of puberty have unfortunately lost this ability.


The best way is to take a huge lungful of air, tighten your throat muscles and force out the noise as hard as possible.
Another method is to start with a full exhalation, tighten your throat muscles and drag in, as hard as possible all the air in the room. If done right (and please don’t hurt yourself doing this) this will produce a demonically high pitched screeching noise like the raptors in Jurassic park!

, One cannot be too nasty to be an extreme metal vocalist, to really get in to the spirit of things you have to get right back to a primal mind frame, unleash the metaphorical and literal beast, the snarling hunger driven predator that underneath all your cultural and nurtured mannerisms you truly are! The words you speak shall pour forth like projected venom, melting all in their path, everyone shall listen, no-one shall escape. You are the nine foot lizard-goat with tigers claws and the unholy serpent tongue that lashes and destroys with absolute indifference. You are Armageddon made flesh and Satan shits himself whenever you enter the room!

, Imagine if you will, your band is about to take the stage, your diabolically atmospheric intro is playing, the crowd is waiting with frenzied anticipation for your arrival, then out walks Dave in with his favourite A-team T-shirt and jeans. “Hello Birmingham, we are The Disgruntled Monkeys, are you ready to rock?”. NO, NO, NO, this is all wrong! For a start you cannot be called Dave, you have to choose something better than that, like “Darth Speculum” or “Rectum Inferno” something that portrays your darkest self, not Dave!

, You can't just wear any old thing you find lying about, get some rat-stomping boots, black combats and a cape, don’t be afraid of makeup and jewelry either, the more spikes and boot polish on your face the better.

, If one is to “sing” one should also have written the lyrics so as to really mean what is being said and deliver it with the appropriate emotion, energy and venom. This makes the song more believable as it gives it the personal touch. There are exceptions to this rule if you think you can properly do another person's lyrics justice.


As for subject matter there are no real rules, a lot of bands in this genre go for overtly explicit lyrics touching on subjects like death and destruction, Satanism and the occult, mythology, historical, philosophy, abstract and also more personal scribblings on any subject at all.
What you say in your lyrics doesn’t necessarily have to be as dark and vicious as possible, but it helps.
If you are having trouble finding inspiration for your works maybe try looking out the window at the lonely globe, populated by a shallow, deluded, and often unsightly people, that is mankind. Now try to imagine a way to solve this problem, war, plague, pestilence, you get the picture.
Remember we are the sound of the end of the world, the voice of chaos, the prophets of the end of days.

, In the early days you might make more money from t-shirt sales than from album releases and go on to become huge.


Try to make your designs as offensive as possible to get them noticed, although these days it would hard to be original as most people are de-sensitized to pretty much everything and have seen it all before. Maybe try pictures of well loved celebrities in compromising situation. Try thinking outside the box if you want to stand out from the crowd.
When questioned by the local media and possibly the local authorities about your sick and obviously damaging “artwork” just give them the speech about how you are a product of the society you were born into and how it is actually their fault, you are just a mirror for their dark and secret selves.
If you even get as far as your first interview, say as little as possible except for the fact that you live in a cave with wolves and hate everything to do with the modern world, and are doing this for yourself and don’t give a flying **** as to what anyone thinks about your music as it was never originally meant to be heard outside your own torture chamber, but the wolves need to eat and you need to pay your cave rent!

, Basically be true to your music and it will turn out true, wasps or not.

, If you are looking for a band to accompany your hellish squawking may I suggest the following ways to do this.


Find a promising young band, fresh out of school and mold them into your own image.
Start from scratch, guitars and bass first then find a drummer who can play like a hyperactive woodpecker on speed.
Find a band that comes close in ability to what you want then slowly persuade them that they really need to drop the kazoo player and think more “metal”.
If you find a band that already has a singer, challenge the singer. If (when) you win you take over his place.
Do it all yourself, great on payday but not so good live!
Feel free to sack and rehire as much as you like, you are the “daddy” they are just a means to an end. It's your face on the front of all those shitty magazines and lunchboxes, not theirs.

, If you are on album number 17 and things are looking monotonous, the passion that once flowed through you has turned into a treadmill of familiarity and an excuse not to get a proper job, then it is time to call it a day, turn in your gun and pass the proverbial torch.


One way of doing this would be to disappear, just stop answering your phone and retain the air of mystery you have kept going since the beginning.
Or maybe throw one final gig, at the venue that made you the household name you are today, go out in a blaze of glory.
But seriously, just don’t get to album 17 and become a stale, haggard version of what you once were, when the time is right, bow out proudly, and retire disgracefully with memories of nuns riding flaming goats and music you can no longer hear.

Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Pinch your throat.,
Exhale forcefully, but evenly.,
Practice growling nonsense syllables.,
Don't chop the ends off.,
Practice changing the pitch.",How to Growl1," Sit with your back straight, and just hum with your normal voice and mouth closed. Put your hand on your stomach, just below your ribs, and hum a few times in short bursts. When humming, one automatically uses the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, so you should feel your abdomen goes in, while your chest and shoulders aren't moving. Breathe from that spot when you want to growl.Put your hand on your abdomen and hum with your mouth closed. Gradually increase the volume. Feel how your abs are shrinking towards the inside? This means that your diaphragm is relaxing and pushing air out. That's where the sound should be coming from.;
, Open your jaw and make an ""O"" shape with your lips. Pull your tongue back to the back of your throat. The tighter you pinch the back of your throat, the higher the pitch of your growl will be. Move your tongue forward slightly and loosen the pinch, and your growl will be a little lower.


Try letting a little air out. It should rattle a little at the back of your throat, without really having to make much sound at all. Rattling is a sign that you've got the right shape.

, Practice breathing deep into your diaphragm and positioning your throat correctly, then try exhaling a few times, evenly but forcefully enough to get a good amount of sound from your throat. You should hear a good, low growl that sounds good for animal impressions and metal songs alike.Draw out the growl for a few seconds and let it trail off. Practice bringing the volume up and down, and changing the pitch slightly. It'll take a little practice.
Keep your hand on your stomach to make sure you're breathing as deeply as possible, and pushing the air from deep in your diaphragm., To help you channel your throat sounds into something that's like music, it's important to practice forming syllables and changing pitch. The following syllables are all good to practice in your routine, forming them as evenly and smoothly as possible:


Yo
We
Ah
Ra

, When you're growling, if you cut off your growl very abruptly, you'll risk losing your voice. The force necessary to stop the sound can wreak havoc on your vocal chords, and you'll end up with a sore throat if you cut off your growls suddenly, instead of letting them trail off.

, For black metal style vocals, you often want to growl with a higher pitch. Keep your tongue down and keep your head tilted up a bit, practicing pinching your throat enough to get the right kind of tone and change in pitch.

"
"
Use inhaled growls for higher pitched songs.,
Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Make the throat pinch and inhale.,
Start with the syllable ""we."",
Practice alternating between exhaling and inhaling.",How to Growl2," Generally speaking, inhaled growling sounds more ""piggy"" and slightly higher pitched, but it can also sound demonic and devilish, and you can do a whole lot with the technique. Really, it sounds a lot similar, but it's another little trick you can add to your extreme singing arsenal, to make your abilities a little rounder. It's only a minor difference from exhaled growls.

, Similar to the exhaled growl, your want to keep your focus on your diaphragm. With all singing, good breath support is important for a good tone. Put your hand on your stomach and feel your diaphragm going in and out as you breathe.


To inhale, expand your abdomen and lower back ribs, while not moving the chest and shoulders. Practice breathing from deep in your stomach, not from your throat, to make your growl as deep as possible.

, Make an ""O"" with your lips, open your jaw, and bring your tongue back in the same way as you did for the exhaled growl. Start inhaling in the same way you exhaled, breathing deeply into your diaphragm.


Increase the volume and force gradually to get a sense of how much you need to breathe in to get the kind of sound and pitch you're looking for. Play around with it for a while until it feels comfortable to you.

, The most common inhaled growl seems to be around the ""we"" syllable, because it feels the most comfortable. This is often used to start songs in the death or black metal genres, allowing you to let loose with a lot of volume. Start practicing around ""we"" until you get comfortable, then try more syllables as you're working on your growls:


Go
Ra
Die

, A good metal vocalist can alternate between the two, so you can sing a whole lot at once, as the song calls for. The more seamlessly you can shift back and forth between exhaled and inhaled growls, the more seamless and virtuosic your abilities as a growler.


Write out some lyrics and practice singing half in an exhaled growl and half inhaled. Try out some Opethfor practice: (Exhaled) ""We enter winter once again"" / (Inhaled) ""Naked freezing from my breath.""

"
"
Always warm up your voice first.,
Try growling words.,
Keep your body relaxed.,
Practice consistently.,
Record yourself.,
Do short sessions.",How to Growl3," Growling puts more strain on your throat than possibly any other type of singing. It involves your vocal chords less, but it can give you a sore throat pretty quickly. It's not always necessary to warm up your local chords with fancy exercises, but warming up your throat a little is important. Never start cold.


Drink warm tea with honey to help warm up your throat. Avoid drinking things like soda and milk, which can make your throat kind of mucous-coated, making it hard to sing.
Don't smoke. Lots of inexperienced singers think a couple cigarettes is the fast-track to a rough voice. It's really the fast-track to addiction and disease. The proper form will work a lot better.

, Even though they're hard to make out, eventually, you'll probably want to be growling lyrics instead of random syllables, right? To work on this, pick out some of your favorite metal lyrics and practice phrasing them and forming them in your growled technique.


Don't try to make it sound just like the original singer. Everyone's growl is different. If your's is lower or higher, that's not a bad thing. Embrace your unique voice.
If you don't want to ape someone else's song, pick a passage from a book you're reading, or some old English poetry that rhymes and might sound cool death metal style. It's just practice.

Write your own metal lyrics, if you want to work with something original. Good themes always include death, demons, dragons, snakes, winter, bitterness, and darkness. Go for it.

, Form the voice with your mind, express it with your folds. Don't try to force the vocal folds to do what they shouldn't do. Keep your throat relaxed.


Intense growling shouldn't hurt. If it does, revise your technique and make sure you're breathing from your diaphragm.
When you start out growling, you use muscles that you never used before at such a strong level. If the muscles around your neck or throat are tired, stop growling until its over and start again.

, This is a lot like lifting weights at the gym. You use your muscles much more intensely than normal and then wait for them to restore before using them at a higher level each time. If you stop growling for a long period of time, your growling skills will decrease.


If you pick up on growling after a long break, take it easy, as your stamina will be much worse. Though, you will redevelop much faster than the first time.

, This is a really helpful way to find whether or not you're hitting the right volume, pitch and style. It's recommended to record, listen and listen again only after few hours, so your mind will be able to spot even the smallest mistakes.


It doesn't need to be fancy, or along with a musical track. Just use your phone and see how it sounds, or open up a GarageBand file or an Audacity file and sing along to a song you like to get a better sense.

, Black metal type of vocals may hurt if pushing too hard or after very long and intense sessions. Practice no more than 10-15 minutes a day in the beginning, it will take time for your vocal chords to adjust to the abuse and eventually you will sound better.


If it hurts badly in the beginning though, stop and revise your technique. Maybe you're pushing too much.

Always start by drinking a lukewarm glass of water, but do not drink alcoholic beverages, acidic drinks(lemon tea or sodas) or even milk before or after doing scream vocals.,
Begin by breathing in and out slowly and gradually take longer, heavier breathes.,
Inhale deeply and try to achieve a ""raspy"" sound (result should sound like you're having an asthma attack).,
(Inhaled Gutturals) Perform the inhale exercise from Step 3 quietly until it becomes a natural and comfortable action.,
(Exhaled Gutturals) When you can exhale easily and comfortably, exhale harshly and open your mouth to form an ""O"" shape.,
When you can easily pronounce a variety of words in the exhaled/inhaled voice, open your mouth slightly wider and force your voice a little harder.,
Practice the previous step until breaking into your low voice becomes natural and comfortable.,
Continue the previous steps until you feel comfortable performing the vocals and saying words in the distorted voice.",How to Perform Grindcore Vocals," The throat has a protective layer that is broken down when you scream. Whenever you drink those drinks before or after it could cause serious and permanent damage to your throat and vocal chords. lukewarm water and some warm tea help to loosen up and coat the throat.;
, Say the ABC's a few times, starting at a whisper on 'A' and ending in a loud yell on 'Z'. These two exercises stretch the vocal chords and prepare them for screams, yells, gutturals, etc.

, Now Exhale deeply and sigh to achieve the same kind of ""rasp"" to your voice (think of this like your mom just told you to take out the garbage and you reply with ""UGH!""; it sounds stupid but it works). Repeat both the inhaling and the exhaling exercises and determine which sound is more easily produced. If you can create the ""raspy"" inhale, but not the ""raspy"" exhale, you should perform inhaled gutturals only (Step 4). If you can create the ""raspy"" exhale, but not the ""raspy"" inhale, you should perform exhaled gutturals only (Step 5). If you can create both the ""raspy"" inhale and exhale, you should perform either, or the one that is the most comfortable and easy (Step 4 or 5).

, Start the guttural by saying the word ""or"" out-loud. Hold your mouth in the same position you used to say ""or"" and simply inhale the same way that you have been practicing. At first, the sound will be stupid and undeveloped, but keep inhaling the word ""or"" until it can be vividly pronounced. Continue practicing until you can say the words ""or"", ""oh"", ""are"", and ""hour"" at your regular, talking volume (time required for this varies from person to person). When you are capable of saying the previous words, experiment with new words and practice the ""ee"" sound.

, While exhaling, blow slightly to gain a hollow effect to your voice. This should produce the basic exhaled vocal sound used in deathcore and modern death metal (known as a growl). Practice the exhale until you can loudly pronounce the ""Oh"" sound. When you can pronounce ""Oh"" easily, practice other words such as ""are"", ""hour"", and ""or"". From there, try pronouncing other, everyday words in the exhaled voice, or try holding a conversation using growled vocals.

, With effort, your voice will hit a low point, which should be the lowest note you can reach with your chest voice. At this point, force your voice slightly harder while closing your mouth. If performed correctly, you will break through your chest voice and gain access to your low voice (which is produced in your diaphragm), which is where the guttural is produced.

, Words said in an exhale/inhale in your low voice should come out as a gurgle-like, indecipherable mess.

, Get some CD's of your favorite vocalists using gutturals and try to match their pitch with your own gutturals.

Make the grudge noise by breathing out the air which you have breathed in using your diaphragm if you find it hard to make the grudge sound then focus more on the vowels when your trying to make the sound example: A E I O U scream either the letters by them self's carry out the vowel Example: ""ooo..."" a word that starts with one of these letters will be easier to scream if you can get the vowel to sound good on its own.,
Breathe from the diaphragm before you scream.,
Keep your shoulders straight and do not move them keep your hands beside you or position them directly in front of you to allow better air flow.

,
To start, ensure that you are breathing from your diaphragm.,

,
Keep practicing until it actually turns into a scream.

, Do you want a Marduk ""argh I messed up my voice"" sound, a Krieg/Burzum ""pitched"" sound, a Chthonic ""Screamed"" sound, Malevolentia ""Shriek"" sound, or the ""Sabbath"" burp?""

, Singers and vocal stylists use the terms ""chest voice"" and ""head voice"" to refer to using different parts of their vocal chords to achieve different effects.For a shout like, Krieg-esque approach, you'll want to practice singing in chest voice quite high, but not breaking into head voice.

, This should produce a quite high, shout like sound if you're doing it right.

,, Many trainers/teachers will tell you that this is a really bad thing to do, singing without diaphragmatic support, but in some instances - such as in a soprano voice - it can't hurt.

Learn how to breathe through your diaphragm.,
Take a deep breath into your diaphragm and push the air out through your vocal chords slowly and you'll notice a bit of growling.,
Try taking a sign of relief, to make your training easy.,
Use your newly-obtained growling voice to push it even harder and at the same time maintaining the growling voice!,
Try saying letter 'O', 'argh' with that growling voice with a higher tone!",How to Do Deathgrowl (Screamo)," It is a must for you to learn how to breathe through your diaphragm so it'll make you sound right and at the same time minimize the damage done to your vocal chords! Just take a deep breath and naturally direct those air you inhaled into your upper part of your stomach (not your lungs) your diaphragm is located right below your lungs. Just keep practising on that till you get it;
, Well that's only part of the deathgrowl but don't worry! You're close on achieving success! (Attention! Never ever make the sound of growling out with your own voice! That is totally wrong and will damage your vocal chords so just let the air in your diaphragm out slowly till there's a growl)

, Like 'hai' or 'argh' like you're frustrated or depressed over something and you'll notice a growling voice but of course let it out naturally! Don't make out the sigh just try to think of something that frustrates you!

, You'll notice your growl have grown louder and that's a great achievement!

, Sounds cool huh? Well that's your deathgrowl! you'll just have to enhance your skill in making it louder and even higher pitch if you could!

Learn how to sing properly.,
Take a slow approach when beginning your practices.,
Drink lukewarm water or tea an hour before performing, as well as in between songs.,
Warm up your voice before recording or performing death metal.,
Fill up your lungs with air, then push out some of the air, tightening your throat and moving your tonsils as you do this.,
Visualize a column of air rising from your diaphragm, through your chest, and up through your facial mask (the space behind the nose, under the eyes, above the upper teeth).,
Push through your abdomen.,
Create the ""angry sigh"" sound.,
Practice growling like a dog.,
Pick a lyric you want to perform.,
Drink a healthy beverage, such as water, after you're done performing death metal vocals.",How to Do Harsh Death Metal Vocals," Start with something that has vibrato, like classic rock or progressive. The most important technique for performing death metal vocals is to be able to control your breathing, establishing a balance between the force used by your diaphragm and vocal cords. Using only the vocal cords will put undue pressure on them and is sure to damage them. Proper technique is established by using the diaphragm to push air out of your lungs. Practice normal singing for a month first. This will really strengthen drive and make it easier on you when you start doing death growls.;
, Start out by doing normal melodic singing for at least ten minutes a day until you get a good feel for your vocal range. Then you'll want to start doing some alto vocals. (if you are a soprano, then abandon this technique, it requires intense deep vocals which is the opposite of soprano.)

, This relaxes your vocal chords. Avoid cold water, as it shocks the voice, and causes the vocal chords to ""tense up."" Also avoid hot water, as it can scald your tongue and throat.

, ""Warming up"" can mean anything from singing mid-tone melodies to delivering your vocal patterns in a clean chest tone. Even humming for five minutes would be more beneficial to you than not warming up your voice at all.


Try doing some deeper monotone vocals to get your vocals warmed up, then throw in a, e, i, o, n, u rapid fire in an alto voice while jumping up and down. This will warm up your throat by quickly moving it in different positions while also getting your chords ready for a deep growl exercise. Also, the jumping helps work your respiratory system which will allow you to work your lungs and diaphragm harder and longer.







, Do this all in one motion, but don't push too hard. Aim the sound higher in your throat to make a ""dying old man""-like sound. It should sound something like a black metal raspy voice. From there lower the pitch in your throat the same way you would with your normal voice. At first, it won’t sound like much-- it takes some time to get used to.

, Keep your larynx down also. This technique will not only help your death metal vocals be strong and present, but is also the correct technique for melodic singing. The only difference between them is that regular voice comes from your vocal chords while death metal vocals come from your false vocal chords. (Instead of vibrating your vocal chords, focus your growling sound under your vocal chords, around your collarbone.)

, All of your vocal strength comes from the diaphragm. It also helps if your back is in a fixed position. Don't slouch or leave your spine limp. Inhale and belt out a deep roar by loosening your vocal chords. Your throat has to be relaxed in order for your growl to rumble with intensity.

, Say ""ugh"" forcefully as if you were annoyed and you will feel a low, slight vibration in the back of your throat. This is the essential sound for false chord vocals; take that vibration and practice drawing it out longer while adding more force to it with your diaphragm. You will find that it does not hurt as long as you are drinking plenty of water and not overdoing it. With practice, it will sound brutal!


If it is your first time growling you'll want to place your thumb and forefinger on the uppermost part of the front of your throat at the back of your jaw. Now open your throat wide, and you'll feel your tongue curl upwards. Now push out an almost ""agh"" sound from the back of your throat. If you feel your throat vibrating at your fingertips you are doing it right. Your growls will not sound as clean and deep or brutal as your favorite metal artists at first, but with practice you'll soon get there.






If the exercise begins to hurt your vocal chords in any way, then stop what you're doing! Growling, though harsh, is not supposed to damage or cause your vocals any physical discomfort. It should be a solid clean feeling; if your throat is sore, don't be alarmed, your throat will have to adjust to the way you're moving it so simply keep practicing and eventually it will go away. Growling should be performed by pushing air through your throat while distorting your vocals. Do not use your lungs to push out the air! You should fill up your lungs as much as possible and push out your diaphragm, then use your diaphragm to slowly push out the air.







, Take a deep breath and go from your diaphragm. Force the sound out from the bottom of your belly, really imitating the barking sound. Then extend the barking sound and try it with several words. Breathing like a dog, as stupid as it sounds, can help you open your throat and get a guttural sound to your grunts. Don't do it loudly at the beginning--increase your volume as you get better at it.


A good way to practice your grunts is to say the letters a, e, i, o, n, u. As you get better at your grunts, try doing this faster.
Do not practice this exercise for more than fifteen minutes a day unless you are practicing a song for your band or recording your music, as this is an unnecessary strain on your voice. A good solid practice of about ten to fifteen minutes a day will build up your conditioning and the power of your voice, anymore than this is simply overkill.







, Try to choose songs from bands like Slayer, Metallica, Alice Cooper, AC/DC or other bands who do not use the death grunts, as it will be easier to rehearse your grunts. Try singing it normally, then slowly add more ""fire"" to it, until you can feel your diaphragm really pushing and you're getting that deep sound you're looking for. If you don't succeed in the deep guttural vocals try a raspier approach. Anyone can achieve this, men as well as women.Good slow practice songs with normal vocals: “Black Sabbath” by Black Sabbath, “Dead Skin Mask” by Slayer, ""Hard Rock Hallelujah"" by Lordi.

Not only will you look happier performing if you love a song, you're less likely to slip up. If you really love a piece of music, you've probably listened to it over and over again. You're more likely to recall how to move your lips properly.Having a vested interest in what you're learning makes memorization easier. For example, even people who are bad with names can easily remember the names of people they find attractive. If you choose a song that interests you personally, you're more likely to retain information like lyrics and timing.;
, The first step to learning to lip sync is to memorize the lyrics you want to lip sync to. You can usually find lyrics online if you can't make out the precise words.


Try singing along to the song a few times with the music playing before attempting to lip synch.
Write out the lyrics over and over again. Actively pay attention to the words you're writing as you go. Memorization of material improves through writing. Write the lyrics 5 to 10 times, paying close attention to each word you're writing down on the page.Remember, oftentimes when lip syncing you may find it looks more authentic to sing the words quietly as you go along. Having the words committed to memory can really help you lip syncing go over well.

, Practice singing along to the song in front of a mirror. Watch how your lips move. See if they're in sync with the song. You may find that you need to slightly exaggerate the movements of your lips and mouth to make it look like you're singing.


It can help to sing softly while the song is playing. Do not sing loud enough that your voice overpowers the recording. However, quietly singing the words can help your lip syncing look more accurate.
In addition to remember the lyrics, timing is key. Try to keep track of musical interludes and how long they last. Try to count in your head to measure about when you'll need to start singing again.
It might help to record yourself singing and then play it back. You can re-watch your performances and see where there's room for improvement.

, In addition to the singing itself, costumes and dance moves can add a lot to your musical routine. Not only do audiences enjoy people who are uninhibited on stage, a great costume and dance can prove a distraction if you do slip up lip syncing wise. Have fun and be creative. However, keep in mind your comfort is also key. If a certain dance move or costume makes you feel insecure, your audience will pick up on that. Only select outfits and dance moves that feel organic to your personality., Lip syncing successfully is not all about successfully mimicking lyrics. Personality plays a big role in performance. Allow your unique personality to show through on stage.


If you tend to be a comedic type, go for funny. Wear a goofy outfit. Use intentionally awkward dance moves. Pick a song that's lighthearted and fun.
If you're a more reserved type, try choosing a more serious song. Try to convey your emotional connection by maintaining a reserved attitude during your performance.

, If you're lip syncing in front of a crowd, pick a specific person and act as though you are lip syncing just to her. This can help make your performance more intense., If you want to master a new skill, you need a guide. Oftentimes, the best way to learn a skill is by simply watching. Look up videos of lip syncing online or attend a lip syncing battle in your area.


Pay attention all aspects of performance. Writers who want to be better writers read and pay attention to things like sentence structure, story, and dialogue. If you want to learn to lip sync, watch for performance persona, timing, and accuracy.If at all possible, ask questions. Questions about the nuances of performance can be a great way to learn more. If you're able to attend a lip sync contest, consider stopping a performer afterwards and asking him or her any questions you may have., There are no quick ways to master a new skill. You simply have to make time every day to practice and, with time, you will improve.Keep a consistent schedule. Practicing lip syncing should become as natural to you as brushing your teeth at night. Set aside a half or so to go over your chosen song a few times.

, There are different kinds of learners. Some people learn best by watching, reading, and studying. Others learn best by seeing and doing. In order to master lip syncing, understand and practice your personal learning style. There are many tests online you can use to gauge how you learn best., You progress is unlikely to be steady the entire time. When mastering a new skill, people usually make a lot of initial progress and then plateau. This often leads to frustration and people end up quitting. Have patience and be consistent. If you continue to practice each day, you will eventually surpass your plateau.

, Do,Re,Mi,Fa,Sol,La,Ti,Do. If you have trouble with this step, get someone to sing a scale over the piece of music for you. The scale that the piece of music is written in tells you what notes may be included in your vocal melody. These are the notes you will use to create your vocal melody.

, Notice that some of the notes fit certain places better than others. Remember what you like and where. This is the beginning of your melody.

, Record these places (or write them down if you read music).

,, Fit each line of the lyric to the appropriate piece of melody. You may need to add notes (sing the same note twice or sing a note right next to the note you had in your original melody).

If you want to write sheet music free-hand, the old fashioned way of Mozart and Beethoven, don't worry about drawing your staves on a blank piece of paper with a ruler. Instead, find some free blank staff paper online that you can print out quickly to start filling in with your compositions. If you are really serious though, it would be a better idea to go to a music store and get staff paper there. Its not free like online but your work will look more professional.
On many sites, you can even pre-set the key and add the clef markers without having to fill them in yourself. Configure the staves like you want them, download the files, and print them out from your computer.
Print out plenty of sheets to practice on and start your compositions in pencil. It can be a messy business trying to get your complicated ideas out on paper, so it helps to be able to erase and make little changes without having to recopy the whole thing.;
, If you want to compose on your computer, you can use software to drag and drop notes, make quick changes and revisions, providing you with easy access and quick saves. Composing on the computer is increasingly popular among contemporary composers, saving you time and effort in writing music.



MuseScore is a popular software, easy-to-use and compatible with either freestyle composition or MIDI inputs. You can record directly onto the staves or work by building your piece up note-by-note.Most composition software also features MIDI playback, so you can hear what you've just written in digital version.

GarageBand also comes standard on most new Macs, and can be used to write sheet music by selecting a ""Songwriting"" project. You can record live sounds or input an instrument directly to transcribe into musical notation, then click on the Scissor icon in the bottom left corner to check out the notes.

Noteflight is a good online site to use if you don't want to spend a lot of money on software as your first ten scores are free when you make an account.
Download the software and start a new project to start saving your work. If you input a MIDI keyboard into the computer with a USB cable, you'll be able to play your melody directly onto the keyboard and the software will chart your music on the staff. It's as easy as it gets. You can even layer parts, assigning them to different instruments, to get started on that symphony.

, Online communities of composers and sheet-music readers also exist to compose and congregate over their music. Much like using composition software, you can compose your tune right online and save your work, then make it public and get feedback from other composers, or leave it private and access your composition from anywhere.



Noteflight is one such free community, and an excellent resource both for learning to read music, writing music, exploring other peoples' compositions, and posting your compositions.

, Want to chart out some horn lines for an R&B song, or write up a string part to back your ballad? It's most common to work on one phrase or instrument at a time, then worrying about harmony and counterpoint later when you've got the first part knocked out. Common charting projects might include:


Horn section parts for trumpet (in Bb), saxophone (in Eb), and trombone (in Bb).
String quartet for two violins, viola, and cello
Piano charts for accompaniment
vocal sheets

, A page of sheet music is made up of notes and rests printed on five parallel lines and the spaces in between them, which is called the staff. The lines and spaces are counted from the bottom to the top, meaning the higher-pitched notes will be higher up on the staff. The staff can be in either bass or treble clef, which will be marked at the left-most point on each line of the staff. The clef marker will tell you which line corresponds to which set of notes:



In the treble clef, also known as ""G clef,"" you'll notice a sign a bit like the ampersand (&), printed on the left side of each staff. This is the most common clef for sheet music. Guitar, trumpet, saxophone and most higher-register instruments will be printed on treble clef. The notes, starting on the bottom line and going to the top line, are E, G, B, D, and F. The notes in the spaces between the lines, starting with the space between the first and second, are F, A, C, and E.

In the bass clef you'll notice a sign that looks a bit like a curved number ""7"" to the left of each line of the staff. The bass clef is used for instruments in the lower register, like trombone, bass guitar, and tuba. Starting with the bottom, or first line, the notes ascend G, B, D, F, and A. In the spaces are A, C, E, and G, from the bottom to the top.

The tenor clef is used for choral works. It looks like the treble clef but with a little number 8 under it. It reads just like the treble clef but sounds an octave lower.

, The time signatures reforest to the number of notes and beats in each measure on the staff. On the staff, measures will be separated by periodic vertical lines, separating the staff into little chunks of notes. Just to the right of the clef will be two numbers, one over the other, like a fraction. The top number represents the number of beats in each measure on the staff, while the bottom number represents the value of each beat in the measure.


In western music, the most common time signature is 4/4 time, which means there are four beats in each measure, and one quarter-note is worth one beat. You may also see a capitol C in place of 4/4. They are the same thing, the ""C"" is for ""common time."" 6/8 time, another often used time signature, means that there are 6 beats in each measure and the 8th note gets the beat.

, More information to be included at the left of each line of the staff includes any sharps (#) or flats (b) that will designate the key signature you'll follow throughout the music. A sharp takes a note up half a step, while a flat lowers it half a step. The symbols can appear incidentally throughout the piece for occasional uses, or can appear at the beginning of the piece to follow through the remainder of the song.


If, for instance, you see a sharp in the first space in the treble clef, you'll know that each note that appears in that space will need to be played one half-step higher. Likewise, with flats.

, On the staff will be printed many different types of notes and rests. The style of note refers to the length of the note, and the placement of the note on the staff refers to the pitch of the note. Notes are made of heads, which are either dots or circles, and stems, which trail off from the head of the note, either up or down on the staff, depending on the placement of the note.



Whole notes look like ovals, and are held out for 4 quarter notes.

Half notes look like whole notes, but with a straight stem. They're held for half the length of a whole note. In 4/4 time, there would be 2 half-notes per measure.

Quarter notes have solid black heads and straight stems. In 4/4 time, there are 4 quarter notes in a measure.

Eighth notes look like quarter notes with little flags on the end of the stem. In most cases, eighth notes will be grouped together for each beat, with bars connecting the notes to signify the beat and make the music easier to read.

Rests follow similar rules. Each whole rest looks like a black bar on the middle line of the staff, while quarter-note rests look a bit like a letter ""K"" in italics, building stems and flags as they break down into further divisions per beat.

A dotted note or rest means that you add half of the value of the note. For example, a dotted half note would be 3 beats and a dotted quarter would be 1 1/2.

, Western musical notation is a fairly complex symbolic language that you need to understand to read first if you hope to write it. Just as you couldn't hope to write a novel without understanding to read words and sentences, you can't write sheet music if you can't read notes and rests. Before you try to write down sheet music, develop a working knowledge of:


different notes and rests
the lines and spaces on the sheet
rhythm markers
dynamic markers
key signatures

, Some composers compose with their pencil and paper, some compose with a guitar or a piano, and some compose with a french horn in hand. There's no right way to start writing sheet music, but it's helpful to be able to play yourself to practice out little phrases you're working on and hear how they sound.


Plunking out some notes on the piano is especially useful for composers to know, since the piano is the most visual instrument--all the notes are right there, laid out before you.

, Most composition begins with the melody, or the lead musical phrase that will follow and develop throughout the composition. This is the ""hummable"" part of any song. Whether you're writing out solo charts for a single instrument or starting your first symphony, the melody is the place you'll start when you're writing sheet music. Standard melodies normally last 4 or 8 measures. This is because they are the most mathematical and pleasing to the ear, as they are somewhat easy to predict how they will end.


As you start composing, embrace happy accidents when they occur. No pieces arrive fully formed and perfect. If you're looking for a new place to go with a melody, jam around on the piano or whatever composing instrument you favor and follow the muse where she leads you.
If you're feeling especially experimental, explore the world of aleatoric composition. Pioneered by composition luminaries like John Cage, aleatoric compositions introduce an element of chance into the writing process, rolling dice to determine the next note on a 12-tone scale, or consulting the iChing to generate notes. These compositions will sound dissonant, in most cases, and is not always the best way to start or end a melody. It can however give your piece a unique feel that makes it stand out.

, Once you start with the melody, how do you move the music forward? Where should it go? How does a group of notes become a composition? While there's no easy answer to cracking the Mozart code, it's good to start with small fragments called phrases and gradually build them up into full musical statements. No piece arrives fully formed.


Try grouping phrases together in terms of the emotions they evoke. Guitar composer John Fahey, a self-taught instrumentalist and composer, wrote by combining small fragments by ""emotion."" Even if they didn't necessarily come from the same key or sound like they belonged together, if different phrases felt whimsical, or forlorn, or wistful, he would combine them together to form a song.

, If you're writing for a chorded instrument--an instrument capable of playing more than one note simultaneously--or you're writing for more than one instrument, you'll also need to compose a harmonic background to give context and depth to your melody. Harmony is a way of moving a melody forward, providing an opportunity for tension and resolution. But don't underestimate they value of just melody. Many times when people start out composing, their melodies have too may chords in them and it is hard to pick out exactly where the melody is., Good compositions should swell and subside, should punctuate moments of extreme emotion and melodic peaks with louder dynamics.


You can signify dynamic changes in the sheet music with Italian words that signify basic descriptions of loud and soft. ""Piano"" means that you should play softly, and is usually written below the staff when the music should be played quietly. ""Forte"" means loud, and is written in the same way. Note the original name of the Piano, the Piano forté; this may help you in remembering that one of the exceptional features of the instrument is it's ability to be a percussion instrument (That also utilizes strings) that can both increase and diminish in sound. If you're not intending a great amount of dynamic contrast in your piece, or don't want to worry about this yet, or you prefer to focus on tonality and rhythm while learning to write, you may consider it's older relatives, the pipe organ and the harpsichord, which have different strengths and will help your fluency on piano.
Gradations can be suggested by drawing an elongated ""<"" or "">"" sign under the staff, where the music should either crescendo (get louder) or diminish your sound, depending.

, The expression process through music is already pretty complicated for most, and there's no need to throw extra dross on that. Depending on your ambitions for your piece, you may want to have multiple parts and polyrhythmic structure, or you may want to have a simple piano melody unaccompanied. Don't be afraid of starting small and refining your work, or leaving a melody undeveloped. Some of the most iconic and memorable lines are the most effective and the most elegant.If you want a reference point from the past century, Erik Satie's ""Gymnopedies"" provide a classic example of ""less-is-more"" music writing, and he was considered by many musicologists to be one of the first to write minimalist music.Minimalism in music is a relatively recent trend, as it wasn't popular till after Satie's death, though it has gained considerably popularity today, and is often characterized by techniques such as: Use of a single rhythm or tone structure throughout a piece, primitive melody structure, use of only one or two scales or modes in the context of an entire piece, and exploration of a single theme using a minimal frame: notable examples of minimalism in the last fifty years include works by George Crumb, Phillip Glass, Steve Reich, John Cage & Terry Riley, with an incredible volume of music including such works as minimalist opera and other vocal music (Einstein on the Beach, and Tehillim, for example) Satie's first Gymnopédia was used countless times in ads and film, but there remains something beautiful and moving in it's melancholy melody, though it only uses whole notes and a tonal note structure, not straying from diatonicism for most of the piece.
Study Mozart's variations on ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" for an example of turning maybe the most universal of children's melodies into a complex exercise in variation and adornment.It exemplifies the Theme & Variation form, which is one of the most popular and straightforward forms one can write in. Other accessible examples of this form include: Beethoven's ""Diabelli Variations"", which were a response to a composition his publisher submitted, Michel Rondeau's variations on ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" and the Enigma variations by Edward Elgar.

Punk is a raw, angry, and assertive art form, meaning you don't have to worry about hiding your intent or coming up with perfect expressions. What want is to be honest and straightforward -- wear your beliefs proudly on your sleeves and you're already halfway there. Try out:



Political Songs: Punk sprang up as a way for anyone to criticize the people ""protecting and serving"" us, calling them out on hypocrisy, lies, and selfishness.

Social Messages: Think Americans are too lazy and need to wake up? Worried that the news is lying to us about war? What about disappearing jobs for working class people? The world around you is filled with injustices someone needs to shine a light on.

Songs Fighting Authority: This authority might be your parents, a teacher, the PTA, or your boring suburban neighborhood. Punk songs assert your voice where no one else will listen to it.

Character Songs: Punk has a long history of taking the perspective of those who can't be heard on their own, where the singer's ""I"" is someone very different from the actual singer. Who's story do you believe needs to be told?

Life Stories: Not all songs need huge, deep meanings. Just as many recount incredible concert experiences, a strange day in Olympia, WA, or the fact that ""Jeff Don't Wear Regular Shoes.""

, Punk is youthful and angry, and thus it's no surprise that it can often be very funny as well. Don't be afraid to throw a little sarcasm into the songs, particularly those about social and political issues. From ""Franco Un-American"" to ""Kill the Poor,"" punk often uses abrasive, difficult language and humor to point out the underlying tragedies or issues that everyone else is ignoring.


""Kill the Poor"" is an incredible example of ""agreeing"" with a horrible idea to show just how horrible it really is -- Jello Biafra (singer/songwriter) is one of the punk's master of satirical lyrics.

, Joe Strummer, guitarist and lead singer of The Clash (""The Only Band that Mattered""), infamously had little more than a 3-note vocal range. Yet he realized the lyrics themselves, and the energy needed to sing them, were more important than traditionally great vocal skills. Once you've locked down some of the instrumentals, start experimenting with ways to push the lyrics alongside them. Some good ideas include:



Using volume effectively: Every singer, no matter their talent, can use this trick. Much like a roller coaster, use your singing volume to create tension and excitement, slowing/quieting down to build suspense and then rising to a yell to drive home intense moments.

Getting a little weird: From Jello Biafra through underground rapper Danny Brown, counter-culture singers aren't afraid to try a strange or off-kilter voice to make a point.

Learning to scream-sing: All of the intense, almost inhuman singing in punk and hardcore may seem like it will shred your vocal chords, but there are actually safe ways to practice this distinctive tone.

, This circles back to the communal nature of punk, and it's not uncommon to see every member of the band contributing some vocals at some point in the songs. These can be anything from simply repeating the words the lead singer uses to adding ""woooaahhsss,"" ""ahhhhsss,"" or ""oi oi ois!"" throughout the chorus.


Check The Clash, specifically London Calling, for masterclasses in punk backing vocals. Even the Sex Pistols, with their famously bad singing, can be seen showing off solid background vocals in ""Holidays in the Sun.""

, Punk is a communal art form, best experienced live and with an excitable audience. A catchy chorus line, especially one people can get involved in, will up the energy exponentially and turn live shows into the raucous, high-energy events they are meant to be.


Consider small sing-along or call and response sections to get people singing.
Not every song needs to involve the audience -- if you want a hard, fast, and barely intelligible chorus, go for it.

, Punk is about individuality, not about sticking to any scripture. If you want to write a 10-minute punk epic about environmental pollution, all without a recognizable chorus, then go for it. If you want to write 20-second songs about Martians invading earth, there is nothing stopping you (and you wouldn't actually be the first punks to do so). Punk is about doing it all yourself -- so go do it yourself."

Make guitar-driven power chords the backbone of every punk song.,
Know that one good, repeated guitar lick is all you need to start a song.,
Re-write the guitar riff for a new chorus, giving the song two distinct parts.,
Use single-note lines and riffs to spice things up.,
Drape the edge of your picking hand on the back of the strings to palm mute.,
Keep solos short and speedy.,
Experiment with other punk subgenres when writing instrumentals.",How to Write Punk Rock Songs2," Power chords are one of the reasons punk rock is even possible. They are easy to finger and sound great at high volumes, which makes them easily played at top speed as well. Power chords are only three notes. First, you place your index finger on the E or A string, which tells you which chord you're playing (start on a ""B,"" and the chord is a B). You then hold the next two strings two frets down -- and that's it. For a few examples, see an A, G, and D below, but know that this form can move anywhere on the top two strings:



A-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord |
|e|----x-----|------x------|-----x------|
|B|----x----|------x------|-----x------|
|G|----x----|------x------|-----7------|
|D|----7----|------5------|-----7------|
|A|----7----|------5------|-----5------|
|E|----5----|------3------|-----x------|

, Punk songs are quick and guitar-driven, usually made up of little more than 3-4 power chords. Find these few notes or power chords that you enjoy and combine them into a short little phrase you can repeat quickly. More often than not, this is all you need to write your verse or chorus. In many cases, especially with shorter songs (check The Minuteman or early Bad Religion and NOFX), this riff may be enough for an entire song.


Start learning songs you love to get an idea for different chord progressions. Tweak, chop, and screw these patterns to start making your own songs.

, To be fair, a lot of punk bands play the same chords in every section, often in a different order or at a new tempo (as The Ramones so generously illustrate). Frequently, the chorus is the faster, more high-energy of the two, but there is nothing binding you from the opposite. Just as many bands, of course, write entirely new choruses -- just remember to use the same key (usually the first chord in the song) for both sections. When writing a chorus instrumental:


Change up the mood or feel from the verse somehow -- get more intense, more melodic, faster/slower -- anything to differentiate the section from the verse.
Try adding a 1-2 bar ""bridge"" into the chorus -- often a few different chords or a small solo line that signals the transition.

, A single note line is when you play individual guitar notes, like you were soloing. If you have two guitarists, this will be the place the lead guitarist can shine. These lines are often the defining melody of the songs, and frequently mimic the melody or voice of the singer (or vice-versa).


Listen to any punk band with two guitarists or more for examples of lead lines -- there are very few bands that stick to nothing but power chords for every single song., Palm muting is the chunky, heavy sounding chords in many slower punk songs, like the beginning of Pennywise's ""Society."" It works exactly like the name implies -- the fleshy part of your palm rests lightly on the end of the strings, preventing them from ringing out but still allowing the guitar to make a sound. Punk guitarists create tension by picking up and putting down palm muted to build volume or get a totally new tone.


One of the most common palm muting tricks is to slowly raise your palm as you strum a chord, slowly peeling off the palm mute to bring the guitar to full volume., Guitar solos have their place in punk rock, but they usually don't last for more than a few bars -- 15 seconds or less. Soloing in punk is often about speed, frequently playing only 2-3 notes but playing them repeatedly. These notes, however, are run together quickly to give them staying power and drive. Other solo ideas include playing the theme or vocal line briefly, then diving off into other notes in the same scale. You can also go the opposite direction, playing only 2-3 slow notes that ring out loudly before dropping back into the high-tempo chorus.


If you know a bit about guitar, you can usually use the pentatonic scales (both major and minor) for most punk solos.
Whatever your soloing strategy, try to make every note count. Short and sweet is the name of the game

, Straight up punk rock is not so straight up -- in a genre of non-conformists and DIY lovers, punk has taken on hundreds of unique or quirky influences. While hardcore and metal influences are perhaps the most obvious (check out The Misfits, Rise Against or F--ked Up), there are many other spins and variations that open up new songwriting avenues:



Reggae / Ska: Most punk bands have at least a few ska-tinged tunes, but check out RX Bandits, Operation Ivy, and No Doubt.

Pop: Pop-punk is the most common subgenre of pop, with everyone from Blink-182 to Green Day showing that slightly more catchy tunes with punk instruments are big sellers.

Alt-Country: It sounds completely anti-punk, but Social Distortion, Lucero, and Uncle Tupelo all bring some deep south sound to their songs

Swing/Rockabilly: The Dead Kennedys might have kicked it off with ""Viva Las Vegas,"" but The Misfits and Cobra Skulls are keeping it alive.

"
Start by simply following the chords the guitarist is using.,
Use the other notes in the power chords to form little riffs.,
Keep the baseline moving to give the song drive and power.,
Vary your picking style for different effects and sounds.,
Set your amp for a clean style that cuts through the distortion of the guitar.",How to Write Punk Rock Songs3," This is the easiest way to start playing effective punk bass without having to learn too much about the bass. Simply follow (or ask) the power chords that the guitarist is using. Note the root note, or where their index finger is, and play this note. Using a pick, strum this note quickly, in time with the strumming of the guitarist. It isn't a particularly unique or flashy bass line, but it will more than suffice for most punk songs.


Rancid's ""Olympia, WA"" is a good example of straight 16th notes carrying the song through.
Remember that, above all, energy is key to great punk. Really drive into the groove of the song and hit those notes in time with the guitarists for irresistibly high-tempo punk.

, You have all of the same strings and frets a guitarist needs for power chords on your 4-string bass. A good example is Green Day's ""J.A.R,"" which opens with a bass-only riff that basically mimics the power chords in the actual song, through with a few extra flourishes. Any notes that are in the same scale or power chords are fair game for the bass to play as well, even if they aren't the root notes. This is where experimentation will do you wonders. Let your guitarist play themselves ragged while you noodle around on the bass, figuring out which notes sound the best.


Try moving the same bass riff with each chord. For example, you might play the three notes in the first power chord before the chord shifts. Instead of making up a new riff, play the same exact ""shape"" of notes, just starting it on the new power chord this time.

, One of the few things binding most punk bass together is the need to keep the song moving. The bass provides the almost subconsciousness groove of the song, and thus a static, plodding bass line will slow down a song even if you can't quite hear why. A moving bass line is one that keeps your fingers dancing on the fretboard. This doesn't mean it is intensely difficult or speedy -- you just have a regular pattern keeps the song rolling.


While not a punk song, the guitar and bassline from the Stray Cats' ""Rock This Town"" is a good, simple way to see how a moving bassline can keep a song moving.
You want, at a minimum, one bass note per chord change.
Check out ""Maxwell Murder,"" which also features a blistering bass solo, for a good punk example of a moving bass line.

, Most punk bassists use picks instead of their fingers because picks have a sharper, harder sound. Experiment with both up-and-down picking and straight picking -- do you get different sounds? In general, straight picking is a little harder and messier, while up-and-down (or ""alternating"" picking) provides a cleaner, smoother sound. Which songs need which kind of tone?You want some of the thickest picks you can find, as thin picks will get bullied around by thick bass strings.

, It might seem like distortion is essential for punk, but that isn't so with the bass guitar. Most punk basses have a relatively clean tone, which prevents them from muddling up the guitar sound confusingly. Listening to old punk songs, note how the bass is generally clean and noticeable if you're listening for it -- a throbbing heartbeat of the song underneath the screaming guitars and blasting drums.


The bass is the linkage between the melody of the guitar and the rhythm of the drums. You want to sit between the two of them without overpowering either of them.
When things are hectic, provide a simple bass ""base"" for the listener to grab a hold of. When the drums are locked in together you might get a little dirty or experimental with your bass lines."
"
Prioritize energy, speed, and power when playing punk drums -- as long as you can keep time, too.,
Lean on your kick, snare, and hi-hat for a basic beat that fits any punk song.,
Try out a double-kick pedal for your bass drum.,
Use big, speedy drum fills on the toms and crash cymbals to transition through the song.,
Build tension and release through a careful use of silence.,
Mix up the verse and chorus.",How to Write Punk Rock Songs4," As long as you can stay in time, and keep the band in time, you should be playing with as much energy as possible. The drums are often the engine of punk bands, and if you don't show up with a full-throttle mentality it will be hard to get the band to follow you. You want to imagine yourself pushing the band just a bit faster than they are comfortable. This delicate but energetic ""on the edge"" play makes punk exciting.


Push the band's tempo as high as you can without completely losing cohesion. The drummer is the entire band's metronome, and they will naturally follow your lead when setting the tempo.
Practicing with a metronome may not feel very punk, but it is an essential way to improve speed without wildly throwing your band off time., This simple beat has run behind thousands of punk songs, and can be easily adapted and improvised on if you want. Start by playing the high-hat on every beat (16th notes). Then simply alternate your kick drum and snare every other beat, creating a driving ""boom-snap"" sound that people can't help but jump and mosh to.


Eventually, turn the kick drum or snare into two hits per beat. Throw a tom hit in place of a snare (or along with a snare hit). This pattern is merely a dropping off point for any beat you could imagine creating., Having two feet down on the floor greatly increases the number of notes you can play on the deep, driving bass drum. While double-pedaling takes a fair amount of practice, it literally doubles the number of notes you can hit, which helps you push the energy and tempo even faster when playing live., Heading into the chorus? Signal the change with a quick run on the toms or a hard, shattering cymbal crash. While drum solos are rare in most punk songs, drum fills are often the most flashy or showy part of any punk song, and the only real stipulation is that you come back in on time. As long as you can end the fill along with the band and keep the song moving (on tempo!), then you can feel free to have some fun on the fills.


Listen to your favorite drum fills with a closer ear. While most of them sound big and flashy, they're likely playing fewer notes than you think.

, While drums are the engine of the songs, they shouldn't always be running. Dropping out of a song, or sitting back with a lighter or easier rhythm, is a great way to calm the audience before a blisteringly fast or technical section. There are endless ways to do this, but some common ones include:


Only playing the kick drum. The deep, booming bass naturally creates a dark, intense feel.
Slow drum rolls, starting from near silence and rising to a deafening roar of drums (see ""All the Small Things"" by Blink 18).
Using the cymbals/kick drum to keep time, puncturing the quiet every 4 beats with a snap of the snare or toms (see The Offspring ""Americana"").

, When writing a drum part, be sure to keep some variety within each song. This can be simple, like dropping out the cymbals in the chorus to make room for backing vocals, or a complex new part for each section of the song. The important thing to do is mix it up, creating movement through the song. Think of each part like a short story. What matters most is not technical flash but entertaining your audience. Start with a slower, more normal groove, build towards a fun and energetic climax, and then bring things to a triumphant end. It sounds overly simplistic, but this simple structure provides you endless options and ideas to make the song your own."

Understand music theory.,
Recognize that brass instruments are not all in the same key:

Trumpets and cornets are generally in Bb or C, with some variations in Eb, D, A, or G. G pitched trumpets are usually bugles used in drum corps.,
Choose a scale.,
Compose a simple melody.,
Compose a simple chord progression that would fit with the melody.,
Apply your melody to your chord progression.,
Make sure the whole piece sounds OK, with no unwanted dissonance, etc.),
Transpose the parts to the key of each individual instrument.

",How to Write Music for Brass Instruments," To write music for brass, you must first have a basic knowledge of music theory, including scalar method, chord analysis, rhythms, and transposition.;
,
Horns and mellophones are usually in the key of F, and rarely in Bb. In Europe, Eb (Alto) Horns are found in some bands. Mellophones may also be pitched in G in drum and bugle corps.
Trombones are usually in C and written in the bass clef, or rarely, in tenor clef. In British brass bands they are in Bb treble clef.
Baritones are in C if you read it in the Bass Clef, or Bb if you read it in the Treble Clef. Bugle corps may also use marching euphoniums written in G treble clef. Remember to always provide a part for both clefs.
Tubas are usually written in C in bass clef, though in British brass bands, tubas may be written in Bb or Eb in treble clef, depending on the size of the tuba. Contrabass bugles, the tubas' equivalent in bugle corps, are pitched in G.

, Depending on what type of song you want, you should choose between major or minor. Major is the norm for music writing, but minor is also used. Songs in minor sound much more solemn, and give opportunity for expression. Next, choose your meter, and instrumentation.

, Start on the tonic (First note of the scale) and try to end up on the tonic, or dominant (Fifth note in the scalar note progression). It's best to just sit in front of your piano and play anything that comes to mind.

, Make sure any dissonance fits in context, and does not detract from the overall performance.

, Then beef up the chord progression, so the poor tuba players aren't holding whole notes for the entirety of the piece.

Don't give up.",How to Write Power Metal Music," Power metal comes in many varieties, so when you're first getting started it's a good idea to listen to a lot of power metal and find out what you like best and what you hope to make yourself. Different styles of power metal use different types of instruments and different arrangements to give their songs unique qualities. Some varieties of power metal music include:


Traditional power metal, which features a basic line up of guitars, drums, bass, and vocals
Folk power metal, which flavors the traditional mix with acoustic instruments
Thrash power metal, which features hard-chugging thrash rhythms
Viking power metal, which features legitimate beards and Norse mythology in the lyrical content;
, Above all, power metal should inspire grand, sweeping visions of fantastical realms, huge, dramatic surges of emotion, and jumbo-sized imagery. In a word, it should be epic. This is one of the characteristics that sets it from many of the other metal genres. When making power metal songs, go big or go home. Your song might find inspiration in any of the following:


Lord of the Rings-style fantasy landscapes and characters
Wizards and warlocks
Ragnarok and other Norse mythology
Sci-fi, H.R. Giger, and H.P. Lovecraft
Biblical mythology

, Power metal songs--like most other kinds of music--probably start from a relatively simple guitar part, chord sequence, or chorus line. It's not often that you'll build a song around a tapping solo. That comes later.


Write a chorus on the piano or acoustic guitar, perhaps in a minor key. Gradually start adding melodic complexity, but don't start adding instruments until you've got the basic melody down, at least for the chorus. You can add more complex parts later.
Unlike black metal or grindcore, power metal is typically pretty catchy. Make sure you've got a good fist-pumper for a chorus. Imagine all the metal heads with their fists held high.






Once you've got the chorus, start writing verses, at least trying to get a basic structure for the lyrics. Sing mumbled nonsense before trying to get the perfect lines together. You're just starting.







, Power metal can get quite progressive and complex. Each song should feature multiple movements, bridges, and components, switching key signatures and time signatures. Make each song a mini-epic. Some power metal songs can get quite long--7 or 10 minutes.


When you've got the basic structure of the song, start jamming on it with the rest of the band to bounce ideas around and start building things and adding more complexity. It's hard to tell how it'll sound until you start working it out in the room.

, Many power metal bands down-tune their guitars to Eb, D, or even C for a darker, sludgier sound, though some bands do use standard tuning. Consider an alternate tuning if it will help you achieve the sound you want.

, The singer should be a trained vocalist, as power metal music can be extremely vocally demanding. Many Power Metal vocalists choose to sing in a high vocal register, but this is not a necessity. Lyrics are generally high fantasy themed, featuring references to Elves, Dragons, Lord of the Rings, and other fantastical elements, though your songs should be about whatever you want them to be about. Many bands choose to tell fantastical, epic stories through their music. Mastodon even recorded a concept album about Moby Dick.

, A common element of most power metal songs is the fast, intense instrumentation. This makes power metal parts particularly difficult to play, so start by writing them and practicing at a comfortable speed and gradually speeding up as you learn the parts. You will probably find yourself writing songs between 150 and 200 bpm, so you will need a drummer who can keep up.


In particular, power metal drumming is important in dictating the rhythmic drive of the music. You will want a drummer who can keep good time, hopefully with two bass drums and double kick pedals, and to use these quite frequently.

, The rhythm guitar is the backbone of power metal music, playing the chord progressions that compose the ""meat"" of the song. Playing a power chord, then picking the root note palm muted is a very common rhythm guitar technique in power metal. However, power chords don't necessarily have to be built off of the root note of a chord. For example, in pre-choruses, going up or down a third can sound very epic, and builds up nicely to the chorus being on the root note. Key changes can sometimes be found in the final choruses of some songs, where the main progression is moved up a tone.

, Minor and harmonic minor scales are great to use, while some modes, such as phrygian and dorian can also be useful. Guitar harmonies are very common as well, with third and octave harmonies being the most common. Quartal (fourth) harmonies are not as common.


Sweep picking, tapping and fast alternate picking are commonly used for solos, but don't think you can just play fast and people will enjoy it! In good solos, bends add an extra degree of emotion when used properly.

, Power metal guitar solos often contain a bar or two that complements or even vaguely resembles the main riff of the song. The challenge is in invoking the memory of the main riff in the listener's mind without aping it too closely and boring the listener. Of course, this is optional - your solo doesn't have to to sound anything like the main riff at all.


If you want to write solo bars that play off of the main riff, practice your solo over a recording of the main riff (or have another member of the band play the main riff while you practice your solo). Look for opportunities for counter-melody and rhythmic complexity - try to hit off-beats that the riff doesn't hit and to create interesting harmonies with the main riff.

, Power metal is know for extremely fast guitar playing, but what's more important than playing at top-speed is playing with control and restraint. A clean, polished solo that's slightly slower than a sloppy, rushed one will always sound better. Gradually increase your speed with time and never bite off more than you can chew when you solo on stage.

, The ideal power metal guitar solo is a wild, furious, virtuosic all-out musical attack. Harmonics and tapping are two techniques you can use to make your guitar ""scream"" and to play incredibly fast, respectively. Work on your pinch harmonic and two-handed tapping technique to give your solos extra power.

, Solos are a great opportunity to take musical chances and wow your audience. Solos that don't just stick to the chord tones of the song's progression are bolder and more interesting, but it takes an experienced guitar player to be able to play outside of the basic chord scales without making a solo that's ugly or discordant. Again, practice makes perfect here - run through your songs' solo sections again and again until you're able to pull off good solos in your sleep.

, Good power metal guitarists are incredibly talented, polished musicians, but they weren't born that way. Being able to bust out killer solos takes years of practice. Devote yourself to your craft and eventually you'll be able to shred with the best of them.

Set the tempo (speed)of your sequencer to 170 - 180.,
Assuming you have a 4/4 bar of music, adjust the sensitivity of your sequencer/drum machine (i.e.,
Add a ""snare"" or similar sound (high hats can work, check your soundbank for a sound you like- but it must be tonally higher than the bass drum).,
Build on top of the beat.,
Add some variety.,
For more variety: If your sequencer will let you, try editing the 'velocity' of some of the drum notes so they're not all the same loudness.",How to Write Drum and Bass1," This is roughly the speed you want for DnB.;
, Reason, Logic Audio) to 16. This means that each ""beat"" in the bar (i.e. where you count 1-2-3-4) will be broken into 4 pieces. Write a Bass (Kick) drum on the first and eleventh beat within the bar. If you are playing your tune, you will have a ""syncopated"" drum beat, i.e. the drums will not fall exactly on the ""1-2-3-4-"" we discussed earlier, but on the 1 and between the 3-4 beat. On its own this doesn't sound too rhythmic, so, we need something else.

, Add this beat to the fifth and thirteenth beat of the bar. This should give the familiar DnB ""Bang---TickBang--Tick---"" sound. This is the basic break beat for DnB (at this speed) and Hip Hop at lower speeds.

, For example, one could add hi-hats over the 1-3-5-7 etc(every other 16th beat) of the bar, or you could add a snare around the 7th beat, or a kick around the 14th beat. That's for you to discover- this is one of the areas where the creativity comes in...

, A song with one simple bar loop is going to get dull mighty fast, so you need to vary the drums a bit. However, this doesn't mean just change them bar after bar- this would lose the tune's structure (a vital ingredient in DnB). In order to add change, but keep structure, you must make your changes repeat over a ""phrase"". In this case a ""phrase"" is a sequence of 4, 16, or 32 bars. For basic hardstep a la Roni Size/ general club DnB, change the drums every bar for 4 bars, then repeat again. This should be complex enough to stop the song from sounding boring for now, although you will have to think of changing the drums again, later in the song (again in a 4-8-16-32-64-128 etc etc bar phrase--remember, it's how it sounds that matters, not how mathematical it is. These are guidelines, which, on occasion, are made to be broken, after you have mastered them.). If you want a more complex (as was once called ""intelligent DnB"") beat, you should aim to use a 16 bar progression, or if you are exceptional, 32 (listen to Paradox - a DJ's nightmare, brilliant music, impossible to mix).

, Also, try to ""break"" the beat at the end of phrases by doing something different in the last bar of the drums - change the pattern somehow - dropping notes, adding notes, changing the note locations.

,, Use your children, friends or family as muses for your nursery rhymes. Replace each line with a rhyming line that describes the person.

, Then, get more creative as you continue to write rhyming poems. Start to write them as they flow out of your imagination, instead of just replacing words, as you develop your skill.

Consider using the bass in conjunction with the bass drum.,
If you are playing the bass over the progression, have it repeat every, for example, 4 bars, and then have a change on the 13th-16th BAR (not to be confused with the (16ths of a Bar under drums above).,
Make it into a full piece by repeating the whole above process and make several different sections of the tune that you will fit together (following the 16/32/64 pattern above).,
Bring the whole tune together.",How to Write Drum and Bass2," If you don't, you may confuse the beat of the song (although this can sound extremely good if done well).

, This will give it a bit of variety and give some ""flow"" to your music. All being well, you will have a functional, if not a little bland, drum and bass tune.

, This will give you a varied tune that should sound a little bit more complete.

, You can do this in a number of ways, you can use vocals and add that over what you already have done; you can use some atmospheric pads to make it sound a little modern and trance like. You can add traffic noises or speaking to give different atmospheres, etc. Really the sky (meaning your imagination) is the limit here. DnB is crazy experimental, so anything goes with sounds. Think bold. Think of your song as a story. What are you trying to get across? The bustle of the city? Angry drivers? Birds migrating south for winter? Whatever, just try to visualise what you are trying to capture in your mind and then add some effects that you think would suit that. You may find that it keeps you more focused on a ""theme"" for your song and helps with keeping you on track.

So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.

, Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the ""popular"" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners’ political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier.


Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.

, Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real ""truths"" rather than perceived ""morals"" or popular ""beliefs"" on the subject.



Start with what is ""society's perspective."" Think of what the culture promotes as the correct ""belief"" or ""moral"" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such ""war for peace,"" ""religiously-motivated murder,"" or ""victim-blaming.""

Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view?

Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect?

Find a ""truth"" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.

, Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as ""verse-chorus-verse-chorus."" Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:



What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main ""truth""?

What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute ""morals"" that they had?

What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?

, Don't stick to ""rhyming patterns"" or ""rules behind poetry."" Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your ""story"" to the listener.

, Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:


What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.)
What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.)
Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)

, Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.

, Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying/hearing.

, Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.;
, This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic ""American"" beliefs behind the war effort.



Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace.

Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves.

Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death.

The ""truth"": Politicians have the power and misuse it.

, They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution.



Rising Action: ""Generals gathered in their masses,"" ""In the fields the bodies burning,"" and ""Evil minds that plot destruction"" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from.

Climax: ""Politicians hide themselves away"" and ""Wait 'til their judgement day comes"" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did.

Resolution: ""Now in darkness world stops turning,"" and ""No more war pigs have the power"" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.

, Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a ""story."" They tied the rising action to the climax with the ""oh lord yeah"" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.

, Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of ""war pigs.""


Popular images of ""tanks,"" ""machines,"" and ""battle fields"" are all references in the song.
Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted.
Fictitious and mythological images of ""sorcerers"" and ""witches"" are used in the song.

, You could use a drum set, some shakers. The tempo should be upbeat, but not too fast. The song you are writing will most likely invoke emotions of happiness among listeners.

, There are buckets of songs out there that are written about love, longing, life... well actually, there are buckets of songs written about anything. It doesn't really matter if the topic itself is unique and indie. You just have to find a way to present it that is interesting and thought provoking. So choose a topic that is close to your heart and begin.


Brainstorm. Take a blank piece of paper and title it with the topic of your choice, then write down as many thoughts, lines, words and ideas that come to mind. A really important aspect to brainstorming for writing an indie song is to think of metaphors. Interesting, thought provoking and obscure metaphors will do.
The good thing about writing an indie song is that the verses don't need a concrete structure to be considered good. They don't even have to rhyme. Have a thesaurus handy to find interesting words you can use that have a nice ring to them. Instead of focusing on having a catchy chorus like in pop, make the chorus

, These will be guitars (either acoustic or electric; if you use electric, it's best that you don't use distortion), a nice but simple bassline, and the main vocals.


Another cool thing about indie music is that you can get away with using those $2 mini instruments that are most likely intended for a child. So feel free to use kazoo's, those little egg shakers, and even recorders to accompany the main tracks. And if your budget is especially low, go on ahead and just whistle the main melody of your song, it works just fine.

, You can go free verse, but try to rhyme. Your lyrics should be happy, and personal. A good way to start thinking of lyrics is to think of your childhood.


You don't even have to have a good voice, as long as your lyric structure is O.K. and as long as it sounds unique.
You should also have some back up vocals to accompany your voice. Something a lot of artists do is record their voice twice on two different tracks.

, Take out the unnecessary details that don't really fit until the writing flows. If taking out a line ruins the flow than replace it with a vague sentence such that doesn't mean much, but sounds like it could mean everything.

, Perfect the chorus, change the blank words to be stronger and make them more effective. Change any bland words such as walking to ambling or any other word you can think of. Add paradoxes and oxymorons to make your song more interesting.

, Instead of singing some lines, say them if they require emphasis.

, The instruments you choose have a strong effect on the mood of the song, so choose wisely.

Learn about how Renaissance music arose.,

Follow the rules.',
When possible, use scalar movement, linear versus leaps.,
Write it out.,
Study the languages of the time.,
Maybe when you’re done, you can grab a few friends, and try out your pieces at the nearest renaissance festival.",How to Write Authentic Renaissance Era Music,"

There were various eras of Renaissance music. Before that, the first era of music that we know much about started around 1200, and was referred to as the Medieval period of music. Between 1400 and 1450 and lasting until 1600 – this was the renaissance era of music, starting with 1400-1500 as the “Early renaissance” 1450 to 1550 as the “Middle Renaissance” and 1500 to 1600 as the “Late renaissance”.
There were very simple rules to follow as far as renaissance era music was concerned, and even as the music progressed through its internal eras (early, middle and late) it evolved, if only slightly.;
, Depending on the exact date the piece was written, and the geographical origin, there may have been additional rules, or occurrences within the music.

Secular songwriters from what is modern-day France were called Troubadours and Trouveres, and they bridged the gap between the Medieval and Renaissance eras. Each had unique musical composition styles.
During the Medieval era, some argued whether or not sacred music be allowed in the churches, and when it was, it was almost always written in ecclesiastical Latin. By the renaissance era, the church began to adopt some secular songwriting practices. There were Counterpoints or Contrapuntal compositions, Motets – which would sometimes include multiple languages, secular Madrigals, and Troubadour songs.
Chant music was a sacred counterpoint that was popular during the medieval era. It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as “Gregorian Chant” after Pope Gregory who did not write, but merely organized the works much later. This plainchant would serve as the foundation for renaissance choral works.
Music at this time was modal, and the most commonly used modes were (in order) Mixolydian, Dorian and Phrygian, Aeolian and Ionian. Lydian and Locrian were hardly used. In case you are unfamiliar with the modes, they are similar to modern scales – The Ionian is a perfect parallel to the modern “Major” scale, and Aeolian is a perfect parallel to the modern “Minor” scale. Mixolydian is a Major Scale with a flat 7 (the seventh scale degree is lowered one half-step, thus eliminating the “leading tone”). Dorian is a Minor Scale with a sharp 6 (the sixth scale degree is raised one half-step), and Phrygian is a Minor scale with a Flat 2. Lydian is a Major scale with a sharp 4, and Locrian is a minor scale with a flat 2 AND a flat 5. While Lydian “scales” are becoming popular for modern music (sometimes referred to as a #11 chord), they were hardly used in the renaissance.

, Intervals were important in writing renaissance music. If you don’t know your intervals, this article won’t help much. Here’s a brief synopsis of the intervals in a Major Scale in C.
C D E F G A B C – this is the Major Scale in C. The intervals between the low C and its other scale degrees are as follows:

Major 2nd (abbreviated M2) C to D ; M3 (Major 3rd) C to E (etc.) ; P4 (Perfect 4th) ; P5 ; M6 ; M7 ; P8 (Also called Perfect Octave). If Low C was played two times in succession, the interval would be referred to as a P1 or Perfect Unison.
C D Eb F G Ab Bb C – this is the Minor Scale in C, and its intervals are as follows:
M2 ; m3 (Minor 3rd, indicated by the lowercase “m” versus the Capital “M”) ; P4 ; P5 ; m6 ; m7 ; P8. Again, two low Cs in succession are a P1 or Perfect Unison. Otherwise, you’ll notice not much has changed. There are more intervals than this.
C C#/Db D D#/Eb E F F#/Gb G G#/Ab A A#/Bb B C – this is the Chromatic Scale. It encompasses every note in the Western Tonality, starting with C. Its intervals are as follows:

+1 (or Augmented Unison) / m2, M2, +2/m3, M3, P4, +4/°5 (or Augmented 4th / Diminished 5th), P5, +5/m6, M6, +6/m7, M7, P8. As always, two Cs in a row is a Perfect Unison. There are alternate names for each interval depending on if it is raised (# / sharp) or lowered (b / flat).
Intervals are apparent between two notes in a single part, and one note and its contrapuntal harmony.



, When writing renaissance music, you will write two to four (rarely six) completely independent musical lines, typically indicative of the males singing parts, or instrumental parts. The parts will in starting together, for the most part line up, but there can be very beautiful harmonies created with opposing rhythms. A single theme that is repeated is called a motif, and it can be slowed down or sped up in other parts, even as one part performs it as is.

, The important rules to follow were:
A.) The most common leaps were up a fourth, and down a fifth. There were no jumps greater than a fourth, and no jumps of a Tri-tone (diminished 5th / augmented 4th). Typically, though, linear or scalar movement was used when possible, using Passing Tones if necessary.
B.) Avoid the leading tone – seventh scale degree (natural 7 – found in Ionian and Lydian only). Similarly, Intervals in the harmony should not land on a 2nd or a 7th.
C.) Avoid non-diatonic tones – try to pick a mode and stick to it.
D.) Don’t think in chords, think in intervals – counterpoint is made of two or more completely independent parts.
E.) Authentic renaissance music did not feature 2 subsequent “Perfect” intervals in the harmony.
F.) Authentic renaissance music did not feature more than 3 subsequent 3rds or 6ths in the harmony.

, If need be, use Passing Tones to negate the “choppy” sound of large leaps. Though you are writing independent parts, it is smart to write them all simultaneously.

, While in traditional renaissance music, rhythm was indicated by mensural notation, if it is a modern composition mimicking renaissance music, it is perfectly fine to use modern notation. The most commonly used rhythms were whole notes, half notes, quarter notes and eighth notes (technically their equivalents) and the breve or double-whole note (which is a medieval invention still used today).

, English was written in what’s known as Middle-English akin to Shakespeare. They had different words for things we still use today. If you’re writing a motet, it may be partly in Spanish partly in English, and partly in French. Sacred pieces will probably be written in ecclesiastical Latin. German was also used. Popular themes included love and grief, sacred pieces often quoted scripture, and as always a popular secular theme was drinking or philandering. You’ll see, music has evolved, but not a whole lot.

, With this information under your belt, you may very well be the most chronologically accurate people there.

Great song lyrics have been penned from an incredibly wide variety of personal viewpoints that run the entire gamut of human experience. Some songs are cheerful, others are furious. Some songs are laid-back and relaxed, others are tense and paranoid. Some carry great personal significance for the writer, while others are about nothing at all. However, nearly all great songs convey some sort of emotion. For starters, when you write songs, try to express the way you feel when you think about certain topics, events, or people that are important to you. Your lyrics don't necessarily have to mention these things directly, though they certainly can.


Let's examine the opening lines of two songs - first, Elliott Smith's ""Between the Bars"" and, second, Kendrick Lamar's ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"". Both songs are about alcohol addiction. However, notice that they take two different approaches to the same topic, Smith opting for an indirect, referential approach and Lamar for a more direct one. Both successfully paint powerful emotional pictures.


Between the Bars: Drink up, baby, stay up all night/With the things you could do, you won't but you might/The potential you'll be that you'll never see/The promises you'll only make


Swimming Pools (Drank): Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles/Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago/Some people like the way it feels/Some people wanna kill their sorrows/Some people wanna fit in with the popular/That was my problem




, So, you've been thinking about things that make you feel strong emotions and writing down your thoughts in the form of lyrics. You're already off to a great start. Next, you'll need to organize your lyrics into some sort of song structure - decide which words go in the verse, which in the chorus, which in the bridge, and so on. Many popular songs have lyrics that rhyme - if you want your lyrics to rhyme, you'll also need to decide on a rhyme scheme (the pattern by which your rhymes are arranged).

, Once you've written your lyrics and organized them into a song, it's time to start thinking about how you'd like your song to sound. Again, there's no right way to write a song, but you may find it easiest to figure out your instrumental parts before tackling your vocal melody - this way, you'll be able to fit your vocals to a solid instrumental backing, rather than custom-composing instrumental parts to fit your vocal melody. Naturally, try to compose instrumental accompaniments that compliment the emotions conveyed by your lyrics.


Songs' instrumental parts range in volume and intensity - some are overpowering ""walls of sound"", while others are so sparse that they're barely audible by comparison. For example, compare My Bloody Valentine's ""Only Shallow"" to Nirvana's ""Polly"". These two alternative rock songs were released within just months of each other, but their instrumentation couldn't be more different. ""Only Shallow"" is a massive, swirling juggernaut of distortion, while ""Polly"" is a dark, hushed composition, featuring just an acoustic guitar, Kurt Cobain's voice, a short bass interlude, and a few drum hits.

, In much of popular music, the singer's vocals are the central feature of each song, supported by the instrumental backing. Now that you have your song's lyrics and instrumental parts figured out, it's time to set your words to music. Give your lyrics a melody, or, perhaps more accurately, melodies - most songs have related, but distinct melodies for verses, choruses, etc. Though some musicians use the concept of discord (conflict between the notes or chords in a piece of music) to great effect, generally, you'll want your vocal melody to be in an appropriate key for the chords of your song.


It's certainly not impossible to become successful writing and selling a cappella songs (songs with only vocals and no instruments) or purely instrumental recordings. For instance, Shai's version of ""If I Ever Fall in Love"" is an a cappella song that spent time at #2 on the US charts. Similarly, the recent explosion in popularity of electronic dance music has made hits out of songs with few (if any) lyrics. However, the vast majority of popular music has both instrumentals and lyrics, so writing these types of songs may give you more mass appeal.
Note that, if you're writing rap songs, you generally won't have to worry about vocal melodies, as ""pure"" rap vocals are delivered tonelessly. However, many hip-hop artists incorporate tonality into their songs in the form of sung refrains or half-sung, half-rapped verses. See Chance the Rapper's ""Juice"" for an example of this technique.

, Many popular songs with uninspiring verses, tepid instrumentals, and laughable lyrics are saved by the power of a tremendous chorus (sometimes called the ""hook""). Try to make the chorus of your song a particularly poignant, expressive, and concise set of lines. Generally, the chorus is the part of a song that people will remember the best, so make it emblematic of your song as a whole. Another way to tackle this is to think of your hook as your song's ""thesis statement"" - if you had to sum up the emotions behind your song in a few musical lines, how would you do so?

, Above all else, when writing a song, try to imbue your work with passion both musically and lyrically. Your songs should make you, as a performer, feel strong emotions - if you find yourself bored by your music, don't be afraid to start from scratch. Music is just as much a craft as it is an art - it's something to be honed and perfected with plenty of practice. The best way to motivate yourself to work at your songwriting craft, of course, is to be truly passionate about it.

, Though some musicians (like, famously, The Beatles) have been able to transition away from live performance in favor of dedicating themselves entirely to studio work, very few, if any, have been able to become widely-known in the first place without ever performing live. To start building an audience and gaining recognition as a musician, it's important to put in work as a live act. To start, look for opportunities to perform in your local area. Bars, clubs, and cafes are the ""classic"" proving grounds for up-and-coming musicians, but they're far from the only places where you can perform. Any place or occasion where people gather can conceivably be an opportunity to perform. Weddings, birthday parties, farmer's markets, and even street corners can be places to build your audience and sell your music.


Don't be afraid to start small - all but the luckiest musicians paid their dues as local acts before making it big. One semi-recent example is Lady Gaga, who become a fixture of several NYC bars and nightclubs for several years in the mid-00's before getting her shot at the spotlight.

, Nearly all serious musical acts should spend some time in the recording studio. Generally, in the studio, artists partner with a producer or engineer to create a finished product that's to their satisfaction. Recording your music gives you the opportunity to distribute it to your fans (in physical form as a CD or online as a file) in a polished, definitive form that's exactly how you want it. It also gives you the opportunity to give your music to the types of people who can help you make money from your music - namely, record companies and industry scouts. If you haven't recorded any music yet, you may want to record a demo as your first move. Demos are short (about 3-6 tracks) ""mini-albums"" that give you a chance to showcase your musical style - think of them as musical resumes for prospective employers.



Meticulously practice your songs before you step into the studio. Studio time can be quite expensive, so you'll want to be able to record each song in as few takes as possible. The costs associated with lengthy studio sessions can quickly add up, so try to get to the point where you can play all of your songs in your sleep before you attempt to record them.
For the same reason as you'll want to have your songs down pat before you enter the studio, you'll also want to avoid excessive experimentation in the studio. For instance, don't let a producer convince you to waste time trying out countless effects pedals. The place for experimentation and improvisation is in the practice room.

, Booking your own shows and studio time, negotiating your own contracts, and distributing your own music is time-intensive and requires a great deal of expertise. Because of this, many dedicated musicians decide to hire the services of a professional manager or booking agent to handle the business aspects of the music industry. Though this option may not be feasible with the average starving artist's budget, it can help a promising young artist maximize his or her potential and rise within the industry. Be sure that your manager is established and reputable - don't fall prey to scam artists.

, When you've begun to gather a following and you've recorded a demo or two, you may want to try to sell yourself to record companies to win a recording contract. Though large, international record companies occasionally sign artists that are relatively unknown in terms of mainstream airplay (see: Epic Records signing experimental hip hop group Death Grips), obscure and up-and-coming artists may have more luck when courting smaller independent labels. Research labels that release the type of music you're interested in selling. Then, if they have a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions, feel free to send them demos, photos, interviews, reviews, biographies, and the like (if sent all together, these types of materials compose what is called a press pack, a standard method artists use to distribute their work and propagate their image).


Of course, perhaps the best way to get noticed by a record company is to generate attention for yourself through groundbreaking music innovation, noteworthy live performances, and/or a unique image. In other words, if you're able to generate fame (or notoriety) without a record label, record labels may come to you.

, Performing your own songs in a live setting is important, but this is only one of the ways that musicians can gain professional clout. Musical artists can (and should) also try to find work as session musicians, soundtrack composers, and more - any opportunity to contribute music to another person's project or endeavor is chance to spread your name.


One oft-overlooked opportunity for artists to create original music for profit is in the world of jingle-writing. Advertising agencies regularly employ musicians to compose and perform songs for commercials. In fact, several music production houses (called ""jingle houses"") specialize in the process, using in-house musicians to create jingles for their clients.Especially when starting out, musicians may not have the luxury of being able to be picky with their employers. Don't worry too much about ""selling out"" - in some respects, it's part of the process of making your name as a musician. In fact, many now-famous performers with anti-authority bents originally took part in more ""commercially friendly"" music endeavors. Case in point: Tupac Shakur was originally a member of the light-hearted hip-hop group Digital Underground (of ""Humpty Dance"" fame).

, Music is a more competitive field today than ever before. With the advent of online music retail sources, contemporary musicians don't just have to compete with each other, but also with the stars of ages past whose music is just as available to consumers as their own. To stand the best chance of being able to sell yourself as a musician, it's important to make sure that you stand out from the pack of modern artists. Don't make music or perform in ways that can cause you to be confused with another artist. Instead, break the mold and forge an artistic image that's uniquely yours.


This advice extends to your music itself as well as to the way you perform. Take pride in the flourishes and idiosyncrasies that are unique to your performance. Many successful musicians, like Prince, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, and countless others, had and/or have performance styles that are unforgettably indelible. The clothes you wear, the way you carry yourself onstage, and the way you play your songs all combine to create your image as a performer, so take time to develop these aspects of yourself as an artist.

, Whether you're playing live shows or trying to move copies of your latest album, it's almost always in your best interest to reach out to as many people as possible. Advertise yourself as a musician using every method at your disposal - word of mouth (for instance, if you teach music part-time, try telling your students about an upcoming concert at the end of their lessons), self-advertising (flyers, etc.), and even cross-promotion with local radio stations are great ideas for promoting yourself. Also be sure to take advantage of your online visibility. Nowadays, a well-timed social media ""push"" can be a much more effective and efficient way to reach your fan base than conventional advertising.


The humble flyer is a well-worn method by which musicians self-promote. These can be easily massed-produced for relatively cheap with nothing more than a basic computer and a printer. Be sure your flyer includes any information your audience will need to attend your upcoming event - time, place, date, and admission price are essential. Also ensure your flyer is somewhere it will be noticed, such as a live music venue, bar, coffee shop, or college campus.

, No matter how good they are, your songs won't ever sell themselves. Use every performance as an opportunity to sell songs - either by reminding your audience that you have physical CDs for sale or by directing them to a personal webpage, etc. Don't shrink from selling your music. If you put on a good show, you deserve whatever money you make from selling your music - you're not selling out by giving your audience the chance to support you.


The internet offers plenty of exciting opportunities for musicians to share and sell their music. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter let musicians keep in touch with their fans and notify them of new songs and live performances. Also, sites such as GarageBand and Soundcloud offer the opportunity for artists to host and even sell their actual music online.

Some recent artists have actually managed to become breakout successes primarily through the internet. For instance, Justin Bieber's path to stardom began when a record industry executive accidentally clicked one of Bieber's online videos by accident.



, You have probably noticed that, today, most of the songs on the radio sound somewhat alike in terms of their sleek, flawless production style. This is a deliberate choice on the part of the songs' creators. A song's production values are a serious factor to consider before releasing it to the public - minor flaws like missed notes, background noise, and noticeable transitions between separate takes can become glaringly obvious with repeated listens. Though there's certainly a market for music with a lo-fi aesthetic, the market for sleek, polished recordings is undeniably bigger. So, at the very least, be sure to consider whether your music's production values suit your professional goals.


Some musicians have the experience and know-how to produce their own music - Kanye West and some of his peers in the world of hip-hop, for instance, produce many of their own songs. However, many musicians don't know how to ""work the boards"", so to speak. If you fall into this group, consider paying for studio time with a professional producer, who will be able to help you record and mix your music as professionally as possible.

, Unfortunately, the music industry has a history of taking advantage of well-meaning musicians' kindness. Always be aware that unsavory tour managers, record labels, venue owners, concert promoters, and the like may be out to get you. Never let someone you don't know entangle you in a vague or poorly-defined agreement. Don't agree to work for free as a musician for the ""possibility"" of pay at a later date. Don't exchange your self-agency for the promise of fame. Don't let any managers or staff you employ make decisions for you without your consent. As a general rule, try to remain guarded as you navigate the music industry. Though many of the people in the industry are completely honest and ethical, all it takes is one legally-binding agreement with a bad apple to completely sideline your music career.


Contracts are a must. Oral agreements, even with people you're close with, aren't easily enforced. Always get any agreement you make in writing. If you're being asked to sign a significant binding agreement (like, for instance, a record deal), get the counsel of an experienced lawyer before signing.

Decide on a tempo.,
Decide on the type.,
Create a catchy melody or chord progression.,
Add a bass and drum line.,
Add some other stuff to the song depending on the genre.,
Think of a hook.,
Write the first verse.,
If the first verse is done, try to make the rest like a story.

,
Add a bridge if you like.",How to Write an R&B Song," Do you want a nice club type song, a more pop like melody, or a nice sexy slow jam.;
, Are you more interested in a club banger, a nice pop type song, maybe a soul or gospel crossover, or some hip-hop influences to it. You can also try crossing country or jazz.

, This usually gets the ball rolling. You can add a little glimpse of the chorus in the intro, especially you are making a pop influenced song. It will be nice if you use a synth pad for the chord progression, unless it is a club hit, then you use a rhythmic synth lead sound. In rhythmic tracks, synth pad could be used in chorus and bridge.

, Try to keep the bass and drum with the tempo, mood, and style. You can add more intricate rhythmic and melodic effects later, but don't mess with the bass.

, If it is soul influence, try adding some brass and some gospel organ. If it is a more club influence, try having a more bouncy hip-hop effect to it with some more modern drum effects and synth leads. If it is pop influence, try adding some synthetic effect and corporate sounding pop elements and pop song structure.

, Try to get something that sums up the idea of the song and think of a melody that sticks in the head.

, Try to make the instrumental minimalist and not as intricate as the chorus or bridge, to allow vocal effects. The second verse can add some layers for variation.

,, A bridge might be a great time to add a rap, take away the drums, or add intricate harmonies and chord progressions.

"
"
First, begin by deciding what your song will be about.,
Now, you're going to wrap a story around this topic.,
Now you've thought of a story, start writing!

,
For the first two to three verses, set the scene by describing what is happening, making sure you suck the listener into this song's world.,
If the song has a chorus, it's good to not include the chorus too much - only at points where it is required.,
Now continue your story, implementing as many of the ideas that you decided to try as you can.,
Once you've written a few verses, add in a twist.,
Remember to make your song poetic.,
But also remember to not overdo it as well.,
But don't stop at creative words.,
Make sure the song has some sort of meaning.,
Once the lyrics are finished, you can give your song a title.,
Add finishing touches.,
And there you have it, a set of lyrics to a progressive rock song that you've wrote and are quite rightly yours!

",How to Write Complex Progressive Rock Lyrics," It's best to start off by writing about a something simple like a legendary creature before you work on more elaborate topics. So pick a random legendary creature - for example, a dragon, and begin by getting down dragon-related song ideas.;
, A good progressive rock song always tells an interesting story or describes an event in important detail to display the significance of it. So, rather than just describing things, figure out the location of the story, think up necessary characters, decide the time period of the story, and decide where you're going to take it and how it will end. Write down as many ideas as you can and then choose the most suitable ones.

,, Introduce the character(s) and the goal that needs to be accomplished. Remember, there has to be some sort of goal in the story. At least one character must want something for things to happen.

, Never rely on the chorus to flesh out a song, because this is lazy. Your song's chorus should be more to-the-point than descriptive.

, Make sure it's adventurous, and if you want it can of course be nonsensical too. Quirky things are allowed to happen in progressive, so add them where you can.

, Send the story in a completely different direction so you can bring in lots of new ideas. If you're writing about a dragon, maybe you can reveal in the song that the dragon's actually misunderstood and means no harm. Or maybe the dragon isn't a dragon at all - maybe it's a figment of one's imagination. Try out different twists until one sticks.

, Using a thesaurus, pick out as many interesting descriptive words as you can. Use these to your advantage to transform a good line in a song into an even better line. For example, instead of the line ""The dragon breathed fire."" you could instead have ""Hellish blasts of inferno were launched from the dragon's throat.""

, Don't cram so many descriptive and unusual words into one sentence that it sounds silly.

, Oh, no, there's a lot more to experiment with in progressive rock lyrics. Experiment with the number of lines in a verse, from small, two-line verses to long and epic ones. Decide which lines you want to rhyme and which you don't want to. Chop and change each of the verses so each of them are of sizes relative to the point in the song's story. You can even convert one or some of the song's lines into quotes said by the song's characters if you wish!

, Maybe there's a lesson to be learnt in this song? Maybe there's a secret that the listener has to uncover from it? Maybe your song can have multiple hidden meanings? For beginners adding in a hidden meaning to a song (and making sure it isn't obvious) can be quite difficult, but one thing you can do is create an artificial meaning from your lyrics. Evaluate what you have written and see if there's anything you can get out of it, and if there isn't, alter some of the lyrics with the meaning you may have come up with.

, A lot of progressive rock bands enjoy giving their songs titles that are not mentioned anywhere in the song, or titles mentioned only once or twice in the song. Few progressive rock songs have a title mentioned frequently within the piece, but this doesn't mean you don't have to.

, Sign your surname under the song for example. Add the song's length (make it up - for example, 9:17), and if you want to you can decide where in your song that the lengthy guitar and keyboard solos come in and such. Unless you're not typing it, format your song in a font and colour that reflects what it is about, to give it a fancy look.

Write your lyrics.,
When structuring your lyrics, keep in mind that Rockabilly follows more often than not the ""12 Bar Blues"" song structure.,
Once you have your lyrics on paper, start with creating chords for Rhythm guitar.,
Establish a Bassline.,
Establish a Drumbeat.,
Create riffs for the Lead Guitar.,
Throw it all together, play through it, and tweak as necessary.

,
Have fun!!",How to Write and Compose a Rockabilly Song," It's important to remember that Rockabilly takes influence from Blues and Country, so your song topic will most likely be along the lines of heartbreak, drinking and smoking, women, gambling, hard times, hot rods, or even the genre itself. This is just a guideline, and is not set in stone. Sing about whatever you want!;
, At this point, just get your lyrics out on paper. When you start creating your Rhythm Guitar chording, the lyrics will most likely be tweaked to fit. Check out the web for info on 12 Bar Blues song structure if you're unsure. A good example of a simple song is Johnny Cash's ""Folsom Prison Blues"". There's four sets of rhyming verses and two guitar solos. Start with that example if you're unsure on how to structure your lyrics. Don't forget about choruses, too! They're optional.

, The most common chord progression is E-A-B. Other common ones are C-F-G and G-C-D. These three follow the 1st, 4th and 5th major chords of a key. You can either keep it simple with three chords, or add in as you see fit. Or, you can combine other chords within a given key. Rockabilly also takes influence from old jazz, so don't be afraid to throw in some jazz chords. Just play with it and see what sounds good. Remember to have your chord progressions follow the ""12 Bar Blues"" format.

, The simplest way is a 1 - 5 bassline. A good source of info is www.rockabillybass.com. Don't forget to add slaps, especially if you don't have a drummer. The slaps act as a backbeat. Keep your basic baseline in the same key as your rhythm guitar. A bass solo is great to add in!

, A good start for the drums is snare hits on two and four and eights on a ride cymbal. Add bass drum on one and three as you like. Fills should be played mostly on the snare drum; you can also use crashes and snare to accent strong beats and unison riffs.

, This step is essential in forming the ""sound"" of Rockabilly, as the lead guitar carries the song through. The most common format is an opening riff to start the song, a couple of riffs after the verses or chorus, and a closing riff to end the song. There are also small riffs played during the verses, and possibly at the end of each sung verse. You are free to experiment here. Scales are an excellent tool to improv riffs. You can also listen to Blues, as a lot of Rockabilly riffs are simply Blues riffs sped up. Old Country pickin' is a good source for inspiration, as are of course existing Rockabilly songs. Have fun here, as you are limited by your imagination and playing skill.

,Try to stay away from chocolate, peanut butter, milk or any sort of dairy; that is just about the worst thing you can eat before performing

",How to Prepare and Relax Vocal Cords Prior to and During Singing," It is important that your vocal cords are warmed up and ready to do their job.;
, This will help with dryness in your throat. For bathroom purposes, a good rule is to not drink or eat anything 1 hour before. If needed, take only a small sip of water.

Remember: While drinking plenty of water may keep your throat from feeling dry, water does not help you sing better. Your vocal cords do not get hydrated, but instead it helps the sound flow better out to your audience.







, If if this is in the middle of a performance, your voice will not being at its best.

, When you are singing, make sure you are breathing from your diaphragm and not your chest. Your shoulders should not rise when you breathe in; they should remain relaxed.

Mental note: You should think about supporting your breath; this helps your tone and your enthusiasm. Imagine something pushing your air up as you sing (like an elevator), or a beautiful color streaming from within as your breath.







, It is important not to drink hot tea or water while singing.

A tablespoon of honey before you sing will coat your throat and relieve soreness from your vocal cords being overworked or stressed.

Don't smoke or drink, as smoking and drinking are damaging to the lungs and esophagus and may pose long-term health risks to the throat.,
Refrain from talking or yelling.,
Drink warm water and tea.,
Avoid carbonated beverages, especially on the day of your recording session.

,
Avoid dairy and gluten products for at least 24 hours prior to the recording session.,

Memorize the part so well that singing it is second nature. You should be able to sing your entire part a cappella.
Refrain from extensive practice 2 or 3 days before the session.;
,


Go to sleep as early as possible and try to get a good night sleep the night before the recording session. Rest rejuvenates your system and gives you energy.
Sleep in a comfortable position with your head even with your body. A proper sleeping position helps prevent neck or back cramps.

, Keep an air filter in your bedroom to ensure that you breathe clean air while sleeping.

,


If you are a smoker, minimize the amount of cigarettes you have the day of the recording.
If you are a drinker, refrain from heavy drinking the night before your recording session.
Don't stop smoking suddenly just before a recording session, as doing so may create problems. Excess mucus may accumulate in your throat and nasal passage and may inhibit your ability to sing without a nasally, congested tone.

,


Don't wear out your vocal cords. Talk as little as possible the day before your recording session. If you need to communicate, consider using a portable marker board.

,


Room-temperature water soothes the vocal cords and opens up the esophagus. Ginger tea is particularly beneficial for the throat. Drink as much tea as you like to keep your throat relaxed and ready. Adding honey provides a bit of a coating for your throat.
Drink plenty of water prior to and throughout your recording session. Don't drink ice water, as it can tighten the vocal cords.

, Once you've chosen your audition piece, look up video covers on YouTube. Replicating a professional singer's sound along with the added auto tune and editing is near impossible. Watching other artists perform the piece will give you a more attainable view of how to sing the song.

, This technique is widely used on Broadway. It's the usage of speech with rhythm and slight vocal changes. It makes a song much easier to sing. A good example of this technique is the song ""Popular"" from the musical Wicked.

, Sing your song while recording, play back and listen for things you like and don't like, try to improve.

, It's audition time, you must be confident, but not cocky.

, Don't scream/shout but don't let your voice get lost in the space between the directors and yourself. The worst sound is of someone who is restraining their voice.

Talk an adequate amount the day of the auditions to get proper articulation.,
Drink water regularly.,
Don't stress out!,
Warm up a bit.,
Always stay positive.",How to Prepare for a Vocal Audition," This is very crucial. Dairy builds up pre-existing mucus, and no one wants to hear sound coming from a throat clogged with mucus., You wouldn't want to get sick, would you?

, you may want to take a few deep breaths from your diaphragm throughout the day. It can really help with the stress of your audition.

, Not just before the audition, but always, to help maintain the quality of your voice. It's a myth that you need 8 cups a day, but you should drink anytime you are thirsty, eating salty food, or feel some buildup of phlegm or mucus.

, This is a very important step. Do whatever you do to calm yourself. Try some yoga or meditation. At least take a few deep breaths! A stress filled voice is not impressive and can harm your voice. Just think that you are in your room singing your favorite song and no one is going to hear you.

, Do something to get your voice ready to give the performance of your life.

, If you go into that room thinking ""I can't do this. Everyone's better than me"", then it's going to show. We use our voice to show a lot of emotion and a lack of confidence, stress, or anything will show. Just know you can do it and think that you are the best vocalist in that auditioning room.

, Sleep is key to the brain's memory functions. Reading through the music just before bed can make it easier to remember the next day.

, A tired singer will have trouble concentrating, and may struggle to remember what she's learned. Go to bed early the night before a performance.


While sleep is important, so is relaxation during waking hours. Find an activity that distracts you from thinking about the performance, whether that's reading, television, or yoga.

, Make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. In particular, eat carbohydrates to give yourself energy, and protein to keep your brain function high. Eat plenty of fiber in the days leading up to the performance as well — nobody can sing their best when they're physically uncomfortable. Finally, consider specific foods that many singers add or minimize in their diet:


Some performers find that eating a banana half an hour before the performance reduces stage fright.

, Hydration is essential to almost every aspect of our lives, and singing is no exception. Drinking plenty of water will help keep your throat and vocal chords flexible and healthy. Make this a regular habit; a gulp before a performance won't have time to take effect. Some singers find lukewarm water helps loosen their vocal cords.


Non-caffeinated tea and low-sugar juice are decent options as well.
If your mouth is dry right before a performance, suck on a hard candy or chew gum.

, All of these can dry out your vocal cords and interfere with your voice. Avoid them for at least thirty minutes before a performance. Smoking in particular can cause long-term damage to your voice.

, Many singers minimize dairy (including chocolate) the day of a performance. While it is not true that dairy causes phlegm production, it does thicken existing saliva and phlegm.This may coat your throat and make singing uncomfortable.


High-fat dairy products (such as cream and butter) may have a more noticeable effect.

, This action puts strain on your vocal cords. Look for other ways to treat the problem if you have phlegm in your throat.

, Breathe in for four seconds, hold the air for four seconds, and exhale for eight seconds. Repeat this exercise until you feel calm and in control of your breathing.


Put your hand on your stomach as you breathe. Keep your shoulders flat and inhale through your nose. Your hand should feel your stomach going out, not your chest.

, People often hold tension in certain places without realizing it, typically their knees, jaw, or shoulders. Usually, just taking a moment to focus on these areas automatically allows them to relax. If this doesn't work, consider relaxation strategies or yoga for long term stress relief.


Relaxing your face and throat is particularly important. Give yourself a brief massage on your neck, your jaw, and the sides of your face if they feel tense.

, Mint, lavender, and other pleasing smells can help you relax. A sample bottle of essential oil is an easy way to transport this smell in a pocket or purse.

, About 30–60 minutes before your performance, begin singing scales. Slowly repeat the scale, extending slightly higher or lower each time to warm up the outer registers of your voice. You may increase your volume gradually as you go.


Many singers use additional warm up exercises. Lip and tongue trills are common tools to limber up these muscles; just buzz your lips or roll your ""r""s as you go up and down the scale.

, About ten minutes before you go onstage, run through your song. Only do this one to four times, to avoid taxing your voice. Now you're ready to get out there and wow the audience.

Listen to good lyrics.,
Understand what makes an insightful song.,
Use lines people can relate to.,
Write raw feelings down.,
Once finished, re-read everything you wrote, and look for key phrases.,
Start with the verse.,
Remember to rhyme.,
Go to the chorus.,
Then the second verse.,
Repeat the chorus.,
You're ready for the bridge.,
Repeat the last chorus.,
Once you're done, you should have enough phrases for two verses and a chorus, take out the piano, or the guitar, and find a melody that suits the ""mood"" of your song.,
Once you have a base for the notes and melodies, try to incorporate some of your phrases into the music.,
When you´re done, you will have backup notes and lyrics.",How to Write an Insightful Song," A good author reads a lot of books, a good athlete watches other athletes, so good lyricists listens to good lyrics.;
, Most ""insightful"" songs are good, because we can relate to the feeling, more than to the situation. This is what makes a great song. When you hear a song that says something like ""On that bench at the park where we had our first date, I touched your cheek, every unsaid word, and every ungiven hug, every forgotten kiss stared at me through your teary, green eyes"" it feels more insightful than ""We broke up on a bench, you cried and I felt bad"". They´re pretty much saying the same thing, but the first one places the listener on the bench, and lets the listener figure out the feelings. Go for that.

, Examples include a divorce, or a breakup with you girlfriend. It can be anything, but a better song relates to people.

, If this is the first time you write a song, start by forgetting about rhymes, music and all that. Start by your raw honest feelings. How do you feel? Why do you feel that way? Which moments exactly broke your heart, or lit it up? it doesn't matter if you end up with 17 pages about one topic. The more the better.

, It doesn't matter if you think other people won't know what you're talking about; just pick your favorite lines.

, A verse is a part of the song were you write what ever you want. You do not repeat this part of the song. but you can on the bridge, a part of the song near the end of the song. for example, on AC/DC's Highway to Hell, ""living easy, lovin' free, season ticket on a one way ride..."" is the first verse.


For the verses, find the ""defining moments"". Looks, touches, words, anything that hurt you, and elaborate on that. Relate each of them to the feelings you had. Were you feeling lonely? Did she kiss you on the cheek and silently implied that it was over? Did she look at you as if he felt sorry for you making you angry? Did he put his hands on your waist, just barely touching your skin with his index finger slightly moving under your shirt, and were you excited? Focus on those elements for the verses.

, You don't have to, but usually it sounds better. It doesn't even have to technically rhyme, it can just sound good together.

, The chorus is the part that repeats itself throughout parts of the song. Such as, AC/DC's Highway to Hell, ""I'm in my highway to hell..."" would be the chorus.


If it's possible to make a chorus out of your favorite line, you're halfway there. Let's say, you are upset that the guy you love likes another girl, and after 10 pages of ranting, you reread, and stop at a phrase that says ""Why do you want her?"" It doesn't matter if it´s not too original, but the point is, it caught your attention, and that's what you need, it doesn't matter if it has little meaning to others, you have to choose the phrase that resumes the whole rant to you. Elaborate on that. And this time, do pay some attention to rhyming and versing. Count your syllables. Try to make most lines have the same number of syllables. If you can't work with one phrase, search your notes for more. If it's still difficult, forget the rhyming and counting; just be honest.

, The second verse is like the first verse but with different lyrics. You still have to rhyme and everything, but it's different, such as AC/DC's Highway to Hell, ""No stop signs, speed limit, nobody's gonna slow me down..."" would be the second verse.

, you say the exact same thing as you did in the last chorus. Such as, AC/DC's Highway to Hell, ""I'm in my highway to hell..."" would be the chorus.

, The bridge can be totally different from the rest of the song. Some times it can be a simple solo, like Highway to Hell, or it can have lyrics too. It can be creative, or it can repeat a verse or chorus previously in you song.

, you want to repeat the chorus you said before, Such as, AC/DC's Highway to Hell, ""I'm in my highway to hell..."" would be the chorus.

, Don't focus on what you wrote, just play with different sounds and chords. Eventually, a sound will come out that will give you the same feeling that you got when you found ""the phrase"" in your writings. Go for that sound, but be willing to let it go if it feels odd.

, Be willing to modify them to match the music.

, It's time to add harmonies, solos, bridges and anything you feel may be missing.


It´s okay if you need to ask a more experienced friend for help, but don't let others throw away the basic feeling you have. Be willing to take suggestions, but keep it honest.

Incorporate your learning style into your approach.",How to Memorize Lyrics of a Song1," There are a number ways to break down the various ways in which people learn.When it comes to rote memorization, your senses are a particularly helpful lens through which to view your personal learning style.



Auditory learners absorb new information most effectively by hearing and/or speaking it out loud.Tactile learners absorb new information most effectively through movement; they learn best by doing things for themselves.Visual learners absorb new information most effectively by reading it, or seeing a visual representation.;
, Just by reading a little about these different learning styles, you may already have an idea which of them you favor. Keep in mind that no one learns through just one of these styles exclusively; we use our senses in combination when we learn. That said, most people tend to rely more heavily on one of their senses (or on a particular combination) when they learn, and understanding this will help you decide which approach to memorization is likely to be most effective for you. If you’re not sure what kind of learner you are, an online learning style self-assessment questionnaire can help you nail it down.If you want to try a less systematic approach, just try the techniques that sound interesting to you, and see what works best.

, Now that you understand your brain a little better, it’s time to consider the best way to go about memorizing those song lyrics. Remember, you don’t have to confine yourself solely to the techniques recommended for your primary learning style; most people will learn fastest if they incorporate elements of all three.



Auditory learners are at an advantage when it comes to learning song lyrics, as songs are by nature auditory. If you are an auditory learner, listening to a song on repeat is likely to be your best bet. Singing or speaking the lyrics aloud to yourself will also help. At first you will need to read the lyrics as you sing or speak them, but with repetition this will become unnecessary.Tactile learners will also benefit somewhat from singing along with the song they are trying to learn, although in this case it has more to do with their propensity to learn by doing than any particular benefit of auditory processing. If you are a tactile learner, you will also find writing the lyrics out by hand a few times very helpful.Visual learners will want to spend some time studying a written copy of the lyrics. If you are a visual learner, watching a music video of the song you are trying to memorize can be a good tool, as it will help you associate visual imagery with specific lyrics. You may find it helpful to highlight different verses of the lyrics with different colors, as well; when you are trying to recall a specific verse later, you can call to mind the color in which it was highlighted, which may help you visualize the words on that part of the page."

Write the Lyrics Down.",How to Memorize Lyrics of a Song2," It's important that you not just try to memorize written lyrics. Listening to the song is probably the most important step you can take. Songs are noted for being one of the easiest things to memorize;this is why setting information to music is a frequently recommended technique for all sorts of rote memorization,and why most people have at some point experienced memorizing a song without even trying, simply by listening to it over and over. Listen to the song you are trying to memorize as frequently as possible: in the car, on the bus, in the shower, while doing chores, while doing homework, while getting ready for bed, and generally whenever the opportunity presents itself. You may start to get sick of it, but you will be much closer to your goal of knowing it by heart.


This will be especially effective if you sing along with the song. If your goal is to perform the song, it might be a good idea to practice singing. Having the lyrics memorized won't be much help if you can't sing in key.

, This can help you think of it as a sequence of ideas or events. Many people learn lyrics more effectively when they imagine them as a narrative, rather than just a collection of rhymes., The more interested in or engaged by something you are, the easier it is to retain information about it.Try to find parts of the song that interest or resonate with you, and look up any lyrics that are confusing. This is especially important if the song you are trying to memorize is in a language in which you are not fluent; it is much easier to learn something when you understand its meaning than when it is just a succession of meaningless syllables.

, Introducing elements of play and/or competition can make the process of memorization more engaging.Time yourself reciting the lyrics to the song you are trying to memorize, and then use that time to set yourself a challenge; try to see how quickly you can recite the whole thing from memory. Draw a visual representation of a line you are struggling with, or a comic using the lyrics as dialogue. Challenge a friend to see which of you can deliver the most dramatic rendition of the song. Anything that helps you enjoy the process of memorization will be a big help.

, Flashcards are particularly helpful because they incorporate every learning style: tactile learners benefit from making the cards, visual learners benefit from seeing them, and auditory learners benefit from reading them aloud, either to themselves or a study partner.Make a series of numbered flashcards (you want to learn them in order, after all), with one card for every line of the song. On the front of the card write the first 2 or 3 words of the line, and on the back complete the rest of it.

, This is a trick used by memory performers, or people who perform feats like memorizing multiple decks of playing cards in memory competitions.It involves associating whatever you are trying to memorize with a specific, striking mental image. While this is not the most practical approach to memorizing an entire song, it may be useful if you can’t seem to get one or two tricky lines to stick in your head. Imagine, for example, that you are struggling to commit the lyrics, “You are so beautiful to me” to memory. The trick is to create a slightly strange mental image in association with these lyrics.Think of other words these lyrics sound like. In this example, you might turn “you” into “ewe,” and “are,” into the letter “R,” and combine them into a mental image of a group of acrobatic sheep forming the letter “R” with their bodies.
Instead of, “so beautiful,” you might think, “sew beautiful,” which might lead you to imagine the sheep each embroidering the word, “beautiful” onto a piece of cloth while performing their acrobatic feat.
Lastly, “to me” could simple become, “two me,” leading you to imagine two identical versions of yourself gazing in wonder as the ewe “R” sews, “beautiful.” This is very silly, but it is also much more likely to stick in your mind than a random sentence with which you have no particular visual association.

, Your brain continues to process and learn about things while you sleep. Not only will being well-rested help your brain function at its best, but studying or practicing a new skill right before a good night’s sleep has been shown to increase the speed with which you learn, and your ability to retain that information., Writing down the lyrics on a piece of paper will help you engrave the words into your brain and you can also bring the paper wherever you go so whenever you have time you can look over it. Sing the song out loud or in your head while you read the lyrics on a piece of paper."

Use a tape or voice recorder to record the song.",How to Write an Emotional and Meaningful Song," What do you want to write about? Love? Things you're struggling with? Wishes, hopes or dreams? Broken hearts? Maybe you want to write about your feelings like what makes you sad, happy or regretful. Think somewhere along those lines, but only you know what you want to write about.;
, This tends to bring out the most authentic and relevant lyrics. For example, you may want to write about love because you just had your heart broken or you've found your soulmate. Maybe you want to write about sad things because your parents divorced.

Just remember how you've felt about any given situation, that you have strong feelings about, and use the memory of that situation as a great inspiration for your song.






Aim to create a meaningful piece: something people will take to heart and remember because they can associate their experiences with yours.

, Every person has different lives and different experiences but similar feelings arising. Just combine those feelings.

, You could use any relationship to be inspired.

, Look to your favorite artists and musical legends for inspiration.

Don’t only listen to “your usual type” of songs. Vary the genres and tempos to see the different ways to write songs. It will make writing easier if you understand how others write as well.

, It doesn't have to take forever to write a song, it really doesn't. Think of an experience you've been through but don't try to make it too deep, too meaningful or too clever. Stay with what feels right and work with that instead of overworking it.

, Choose somewhere you won't be disturbed and where you feel inspired. Under the clothesline at the back of your house might just turn out to be the perfect songwriting locale!

, Rely upon your heart and soul to help you create the song. Don't worry about the music just yet. Right now, you just need lyrics.


Remember, the average song has a chorus (the part that repeats in the song), at least 2 verses and a title.
Remember those feelings or emotions and just let them flow.






Give yourself time to compose something you're proud of.

, Random lines can be drawn together later, as you develop the song. What's important is that you capture them as they come to you.

, Ask others to listen to your lyrics. If you find that people don't like them, keep working at it and use their feedback as inspiration to improve the lyrics and expression of feelings. While your feelings matter, other people can act as soundboards for how they perceive (or don't perceive) their own feelings being reflected in the song. This will matter when it comes to the song's popularity, as it needs to resonate with the listeners.


Don't be afraid to make changes. You will, usually, never get all the pieces to fit on the first run. Sometimes the lyrics have to be changed to fit the music and vice versa.

, Make sure it reflects what your song is about For example, a song called ""I'm so in love with you"" has a pretty obvious meaning. ""Mother"" is a more mysterious title, because it could mean many different things.

, Use music that fits the mood. A sad song has a lot of minor and diminished chords to it. A happy song will be set in major keys. Angry music usually has a driving beat and minor keys. Let the lyrics guide the music. The composition will dictate the chord changes, and basic layout of the music.


To start to get a tune together, begin with writing chords to go with the lyrics. After you have the basic chords down, you can write notes and a beat.

, Play it back to listen for where you want to make changes.


You may even want to perform it for someone.

, Unless your performing an odd whisper quiet scream, you will need a microphone that can handle high amounts of volume(or SPL) safely. The Shure SM 58/57 are both reliable and very good selections on a budget however most professional screamers tend to lean words either the Shure SM7b or a higher end Audio Technica condenser microphone.

, Some screamers insist on NOT using these, opting to hold the mic and deal with plosives (excessive P and S sounds) in the mix. Such as Phil Bozeman of Whitechapel or Ronnie Canizaro of Born Of Osiris. However if you can train yourself to use these two items you can get very good vocal tracks much easier and avoid the nightmare of clip restoration in the mix.

, You will need a device that can connect your microphone to your computer. Searching amazon one can find several USB audio interfaces. This is certainly something you should dump some money into if you can for higher end results.

, Once you have all of your materials you are ready to record. Set your track up in your DAW and run some basic ""can you hear me."" tests to see if everything is connected correctly. If you receive audio in the track then you are ready to record.

, Given that you know how a compressor works, give a slight 2:1 compression going in to give overall body and presence to your screamed track. DO NOT use much more than this going in.

, These include De-essing, noise gating, and EQ. All three of these will need to be done to taste. If you cannot monitor your track with the VSTs in real time, you will simply have to apply the effect then ""undo"" if you don't like it and try again.

, EQ is most certainly something that nobody can do for you other than yourself. A basic rule of the thumb with EQ in ANY audio you are recording is if you are having to use more than a little, then the problem is with the source. In screaming you may find that you need a tiny bit more than a clean vocalist(screams are unnatural so it is understandable that they may need a bit more). While there are no set rules as to how to EQ screamed vocals(or anything for that matter) it is popular to gently roll off some low end to reduce the ""gargle"" in the screams. At roughly 400, start to take it down in the graphic equalizer. It should never drop below -2. Then simply play around with some other popular EQ adjustments such as making a small dent in the upper mids or barely raising the high end between 6k-12k.

, Compression is probably the most important part. You will do this a couple of times aside from the light compression you used going in. The first compressor you use will add body and ""oomph"" to the track. You can do this with any compressor but a very famous and wonderful sounding compressor for this(and free by the way) is called Block Fish. Simply Google it to download it. It has a preset known as ""Close Up Vocals"" which will give you incredible body and tone from your screams. You will need to play with some of the basic parameters to make it ideal.

, This is optional. This is popular in a lot of high end studio bands you hear today. DO NOT use sloppy guitar style distortion, you will need to find saturation meant for vocals. A wonderful sounding plug in for this is Antares ""Warm"". Warm has a drive emulator and a limiter, combined to create an incredible saturation sound. Go easy on this though.

, This time to flatten things out. Your vocal track should look like a nice fat brick on the graph after this. You will need to slam your compressor hard with ratios. 7:1 with an instant attack and hearty release will do the trick but you may find it necessary to go even stronger with 9:1.

, Reverbs roomy sound will help smooth out the vocal track. You will need to play around a lot here. If your new to audio mastering simply open a reverb preset in your DAW and play with the wet and dry levels. This is by no means ""professional"" but it will certainly work if your new.

, Go very easy with chorus effect and possibly even don't use it, however if done correctly chorus can give your vocal track a beautiful rich sound that is key in that ""expensive studio"" sound.

, By this point in time you will have a very nice, fat, professional sounding screamed vocal track. However the volume may be pretty low due to all of the compression. Simply lay the track down in multi-track editor of your DAW(if possible) and increase the volume of the track until it fits with the instrumentals.

Get inspired.,
Listen to composers you admire.,
Pick your themes.,
Create an outline.,
Gather your materials.,
Start writing.,
Assign melodies to different instruments.,
Give yourself a couple days away from your symphony.,
Re-listen and revise.,
Invite your friends and other musicians you trust to perform and give feedback on your symphony.",How to Write a Symphony," The most important thing you’ll need while writing your symphony is an idea. To generate ideas, you’ll need to start thinking creatively. Set up a musical session with some of your instrument playing friends to improvise some potential melodies. Look back through old journals to remind yourself of feelings or life events that you might be able to use in your work.


Keep notebook with you at all times to record ideas. Whenever an idea comes to you, write it down immediately so you don’t forget.;
, Practice writing your music the way those composers wrote theirs. It isn’t plagiarism to be inspired by someone else, and that inspiration fused with your own point of view will make it so that your music will sound completely your own.Try to listen to a wide cross-section of different symphonies. Different composers have different styles and use different techniques. Listening to a lot of different styles of symphonies will help you become inspired to write your own. Check out the list of symphonic composers on Wikipedia by googling symphony and the title List of Symphony Composers will also be there. The list is reasonably complete dating from the Baroque era to present and most composers on the list aren't well known. , Essentially, symphonies are musical stories, and should have characters, or, themes. These themes are then explored in different keys throughout the piece and in music, in what’s known as exposition.Try to pick contrasting themes, like good versus evil.

, Symphonies are traditionally composed of four separate movements, which each have different forms.The first movement tends to be in Sonata form. The second movement is usually on the slower side and may be a set of variations. The third movement will generally be a Minuet or Scherzo and Trio. And the fourth movement is there to give the piece some closure and is often in rondo form.


In your outline, list out everything you want to pin down about your symphony. This can include your inspiration, emotions, form, key and themes. List these out for each of your individual movements.
Don’t be afraid to make the form your own. If you want to create something different than the traditional four-movement symphony, do that. Sometimes composers swap the second and third movements. There have been three movement symphonies, usually omitting the minuet. There are five movement symphonies, often adding a March, or maybe another Scherzo or Minuet between the third and last movement. There are some with more than five movements, taking inspiration from Beethoven's 9th; the best known of these including the Romeo et Juliette symphony by Berlioz and Mahler's Symphonies. Rarer still are some with only two movements. Often symphonies have had a thematic material that ties all of the movements together since the romantic era which may stay the same or vary as well. Think outside the box and have fun with it.

, In order to write, you will either need staff paper and a writing implement, such as a pencil or pen, or some kind of music writing software. Writing by hand is problematic because, in order to hear what you’ve played, you have to be able to play an instrument or you need to find someone else who can.With music notation software, you’re able to hear what you’ve written immediately, using the computer playback.


Some examples of music writing software include: Sibelius First, Finale and MagicScore Maestro.For free music writing software, try MuseScore and Lilypond.
If you play or have access to an instrument, you can try playing your melodies using your instrument to hear how they sound before writing them down.

, Using the outline you created earlier, construct each individual movement. While writing, you’ll need to be constantly making decisions regarding different musical techniques and styles within your piece. Some of those techniques include:Dynamics
Rhythms
Intervals
Harmonies
Theme development
Counterpoint
Voice leading
Orchestration

, Traditionally, symphonies are written for the following instrumental types: strings (violin, viola, cello, and bass) woodwinds (2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, and 2 bassoons) brass (2 French horn, 2 trumpets with a small orchestra) and percussion (2 tympani, triangle, and cymbal) for a small orchestra. A medium size is when you can add a piccolo, English horn, bass clarinet, contra bassoon to the woodwinds and double the number of French horns and add 3 trombone plus a tuba to the brass as well as extra percussion instruments. If you can go larger, go for it.


You don't however, have to stick with traditional instrumentation. If the instruments are available and there are players to play them, feel free to use other instruments in your symphony either adding them or using them like different colors (eg. replace one traditional instrument with one non-traditional one). For example, the inventor of the saxophone family designed his instruments for the orchestra (built in the keys of Bb and Eb) as well as the military band. You could also include an instrument that's been revived like one of the recorders, the viola da gamba or the oboe da caccia for example.
Some symphonies also have vocal accompaniment.Try giving the same melodies to different instruments at different times to create a motif within the piece.Pay attention to layers and texture. There should never be any more than five layers happening at one time., Use this time to think about and do other things. Taking time away from your music will allow you to come back to it with fresh ears, so you can edit with a clear head.

, Play through your symphony again. Take out anything that doesn’t jar with your artistic vision. If you feel that your symphony is too long or too short, adjust accordingly.


Try playing through your symphony on the piano. Even if you’re not a skilled pianist, you should still be able to play the melodies. As a composer, playing through your music will help with making sure your piece isn’t too muddled. It will also enable you to see what is in every register at all times., Listening to your symphony played all the way through will give you a whole slew of new insights on your work. Your friends and performers might also have suggestions of changes you can make that you might never have thought of yourself.


Do not get defensive about their suggestions: they are only trying to help and you are not bound to utilize any of their feedback if you don’t agree with it."

Workshop your song with others.",How to Write a Song with Guitar Chords," Imagine settings and characters. Although the subject matter can be just about anything, songs are widely used to convey very personal stories, so focus on characters especially: their motivations, what actions they might take, and the consequences of those actions.


Of course, no rule says that you must start with lyrics before composing the music. So if you wake in the night with a snatch of melody in your head, feel free to skip ahead to Part 2 and start from there.But having a firm grasp on the story you want to tell can make critical choices easier when composing music.
Even if you only aim to create an instrumental piece, consider keeping a story in mind to guide you. Classical composers would often do this for inspiration. For instance, Dvorak scored the second and third movements of his ninth symphony, “From the New World,” to a poem by Henry Wordsworth Longfellow.;
, Songs are typically structured into verses and choruses. A traditional verse is composed of four lines, with the second and fourth line forming a rhyme. Build your characters here and develop your story.For example, Bruce Springsteen’s “Brilliant Disguise” depicts the mounting mistrust between a husband and his wife. Each verse depicts their relationship by listing the husband's growing suspicions.

, While verses develop a story, the chorus sums up the situation. Use the chorus to hammer home the point you're trying to make.It can be expressed in a single line that’s only sung once, a single line that’s repeated for emphasis, a rhyming couplet, or four lines, just like a traditional verse.


In “Brilliant Disguise,” Springsteen follows the four-line format for his chorus. In a few words, he sums up the overall theme of mistrust with: “So tell me what I see/When I look in your eyes/Is that you, baby/Or just a brilliant disguise?”

, A middle-eight (also known as a bridge) is a unique piece of music within a song. Usually it comes before the last verse and chorus, offering the audience a fresh change in sound. Lyrically, they serve as a means to express a significant change in the story, whether it's a change in perspective for the characters or a new turn in the narrative. However, middle-eights are not necessary, so don’t feel obligated to write one.In the last verse before the middle-eight in “Brilliant Disguise,” the narrator begins to switch focus from his wife to himself as he wonders why she’s with him at all. Springsteen employs the middle-eight to expand this shifted focus. Here, the narrator examines his own actions and state of mind, revealing a new dimension to his mistrust with the conclusion: “I wanna know if it’s you I don’t trust/‘Cause I damn sure don’t trust myself”

, In your first draft, concentrate on the story itself and flesh it out in full. With each subsequent draft, make edits that will strengthen your lyrics when sung.


Count the number of syllables in each line to make sure no one line has too many for you to sing.
If you’re using a rhyming scheme, identify cliched rhymes, like “forever” and “together."" See if you can express the same idea in other words that will stand out as an original statement instead of a borrowed phrase.
Don’t worry about perfecting a final draft just yet. Most likely you will have to make additional edits once you’ve composed the music.

, C, D, E, G, and A lend themselves well to the guitar.Certain keys tend to elicit specific emotions from the audience. Choose one that complements the tone of your story.Use major keys to elicit happier responses from audiences, and minor keys to evoke sadness.To hear the difference between major and minor, listen to John Williams' original “Imperial March” from the Star Wars movies. In the movies, it's played in G minor and sounds exactly like the terrifying war march that it’s supposed to be. However, you can find other recordings online where it's played in G major instead, which makes it sound more like a pleasant little parade march for a sunny afternoon.
Listen to the following songs, which have been grouped by keys.Gauge your own reactions to them, and decide which ones you wish to replicate: A: “Out on the Weekend,” by Neil Young; “Wild Thing” by Chip Taylor C: “Imagine,” by John Lennon; “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” by Oasis D: “Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty; “Should I Stay or Should I Go,” by the Clash E: “Mrs. Robinson,” by Simon & Garfunkel; “Take a Message to Mary,” by the Everly Brothers G: “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay,” by Otis Redding; “Eternal Flame,” by the Bangles

, Chord progressions are expressed numerically (for example: I-IV-V) with each chord being a degree in your key scale. The “one” or tonic chord is always the key you’ve chosen to play in. Roman numerals map out the other chords in that scale: uppercase numerals denote major chords; lowercase numerals, minor chords. A numeral followed by “dim” indicates a diminished chord.A I-IV-V chord progression played in the key of D, for instance, would run D-G-A.

, Two-chord progressions may sound simple, but they are limited, which means you may have to employ some extra tricks and nuanced playing to make your song stand out.Three- and four-chord progressions are perhaps the most common in popular music.*For reference, listen to the following songs, which have been grouped by the number of chords in their progressions: One chord: “Get Up, Stand Up,” by Bob Marley; “Coconut,” by Harry NilssonTwo chords: “My Generation,” by the Who; “Wrong Way,” by SublimeThree chords: “Twist and Shout,” by the Beatles; “Let My Love Open the Door,” by Pete TownshendFour chords: “With or Without You,” by U2; “Peace of Mind,” by Boston, Let's say you’ve selected the I-V-IV for your intro and verses; for the chorus, try switching to the V-IV-I progression.Tinker with various chords and progressions until you find a combination that matches the mood of your lyrics.


Listen to the following songs, which have been grouped by their respective chord progressions:I-IV-V: “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door,” by Bob Dylan; “Sweet Home Alabama,” by Lynyrd Skynyrd I-V-IV: “Rock around the Clock,” by Bill Haley & His Comets; “Margaritaville,” by Jimmy Buffet

, Countless melodies can be played over a single chord progression.Sing or hum your lyrics as you play until you find a melody that complements your story.


If you’re stuck, forget the song you’re working on and jam away without worrying about finding the “right” tune. Play stream-of-conscious-style for the sheer pleasure of it. You may just discover the right tune by accident.
If you’re still stuck, play one or more songs by other artists who inspire you. Once you’ve mastered their melodies, experiment with changing them bit by bit, studying the effects that each change makes, until you’ve come up with a melody that’s similar yet distinct from the original.
Remember: there is a thin line between imitation and plagiarism. When using other people’s works as inspiration, honesty is the best policy; Kurt Cobain admitted that Nirvana’s “Smells like Teen Spirit” was a rip-off of the Pixies.The music to the Smiths’ “Rusholme Ruffians,” meanwhile, was so directly influenced by Elvis Presley’s “Marie’s the Name (of His Latest Flame), the band would open their own song in concert by playing the first couple of verses of Elvis's; you can hear both the similarity and the subtle differences between the two on their live album, “Rank.”

, Now that you have your music, revise your lyrics if any one word or phrase trips you up while singing them out loud. For instance, say that you use the word “particular” in one line, which you now find to be one syllable too many to enunciate clearly; try replacing it with a shorter synonym, like “certain” or “single.”

, Spice your chorus up with an extra musical or lyrical phrase to make it more catchy. Lyrically, this could be the “Yeah, yeah, yeah” in the chorus to the Beatles’ “She Loves You.” Musically, it could be the Edge’s guitar lick in U2’s “With or Without You.” Either way, it’s an extra flourish to the chorus that creates an expectation for repetition in the next chorus; by fulfilling that expectation, the hook creates satisfaction in the listener. As with writing lyrics and melodies, embrace the trial-and-error process. The right hook might come to you immediately, or you may have to work your way through several before finding the right one. , Be sure that it supports the emotional payoff that you want your song to deliver.


If your story requires numerous verses to build your characters effectively, consider having two verses before each chorus instead of one, so that the chorus’s effect on the audience doesn’t wear off due to excessive repetition.
If your characters have changed significantly by the end of your story, consider adding a twist to the last chorus to signify this change. Going back to the last chorus of “Brilliant Disguise” as an example, the narrator now dares his wife: “Tell me what you see/When you look in my eyes/Is that me, baby/Or just a brilliant disguise?”
If your story ends on a note of ambiguity, as “Brilliant Disguise"" does, consider ending with a verse as opposed to a chorus. Since most popular songs end with one or more choruses, play with your audience’s expectations by denying them the neat little ending that they’re anticipating.

, Test your material by playing an open-mic night or for one or more friends and then ask for honest feedback. If playing for friends, be sure to stress the “honest” in “honest feedback.” Seek out songwriters whom you know and respect for tips and techniques.

They’ll give you an idea of what a good parody does and how the genre works. Listen to as many parody songs as you can to get a good idea of where to start., Some parodies are funny, others are educational, and others parody entire genres instead of specific songs. The type of parody you write will depend on your personality and the kind of audience you want to reach.Humorous parodies are the most common type of parody song. For this type of parody, you’ll change the lyrics of a popular song or one that’s easy to recognize. The new lyrics will be silly, offbeat or downright hilarious. Examples include “White and Nerdy” by Weird Al Yankovic, “What Makes You Beautiful” by The Key of Awesome or “The Star Wars I Used to Know” by Teddie Films.Educational parodies are often written by teachers or coaches for their students. They make remembering facts and information easier, because the info is set to the tune of a popular song. You can write your own educational parodies for classes you’re taking: just write new lyrics about math, geology or art history for a song you like.
Genre parodies are a little more general than parodies of specific songs, but are often just as funny. These types of parodies involve a little more work, because you may have to write your own original song instead of use an existing pop song. With a genre parody like a song from Deathklok or The Lonely Island, you’ll use an original song to make fun of stereotypes about certain types of music, like metal or overly-sexual pop songs.

, The kind of parody you write will depend a lot on the people that will be listening to it. If you're just going to show it to friends, it will make sense to choose a song that you all like. For larger audiences reached with a Youtube post, you'll want to pick a more widely popular song.

, It needs to be a song that people recognize instantly, so a current pop hit or an old standard would be a good choice. Again, make sure it’s also a song that appeals to your target audience. If you’re writing a parody song for your friends who love hip hop, you might pick a Kanye West song instead of a Katy Perry song.Pick a song with a distinct chorus and verses. The more separate and obvious the verses and choruses of a song are, the easier it will be to write your parody. The chorus can be repeated multiple times, and you’ll only need to write new words for the verses.
Pick a song you like. Parody writers generally admire the songs that they parody, and decide to make them funnier. You'll also have to listen to the song many times to write the lyrics, so don't pick a song that you dislike.

, Listen to the song a few times to get a feeling for the beat and the flow of the lyrics. Start thinking about good substitutes for words in the songs. Some parodies will come naturally, because the words may sound like other, more funny words or plots. For example, Weird Al’s “Eat It” and “White and Nerdy” started out as “Beat It” and “Ridin’ Dirty.”Think about potential substitutes. The kind of lyrics you'll want to write obviously depend on your sense of humor and the type of song, but there are different things you can look out for. Listen for words in the chorus that could be substituted for other words, especially if the new words are silly or ridiculous: ""Sugar"" by Maroon 5 might become ""Booger"", while ""Hotline Bling"" by Drake could become ""Burger King"".

, For some songs, you may not have to change certain lyrics. If some lines could have double meanings, leave them to create extra comedic effect. “TNT” by AC/DC could become an education song about actual explosives, while “Stone Cold” by Demi Lovato could turn into a song about the wrestler.

, You’ll want your parody to have a cohesive theme from start to finish. Some parodies tell stories, while others describe situations or types of people. Either way, you’ll want the chorus and verses to play off of each other, instead of having them be disjointed or about topics that don’t match up.


Change a word to something silly to generate your theme. Once you have one funny word, like ""Booger"" instead of ""Sugar"" or ""Burger King"" instead of ""Hotline Bling"", build the rest of the song around it. ""Burger King"" could be about working at a Burger King or going on a late night run for fast food, while ""Booger"" could turn into a story about gross bodily functions.
Make up a story. If you haven't found any substitute words yet, simply make up your own topic. The more off the wall it is, the funnier your parody will be. ""Work"" by Rihanna could become a story about hating your job, while ""Trap Queen"" by Fetty Wap could turn into a story about a female fur trapping expert from Alaska.
Write educational content with a sense of humor. Write a Christian-Pop-style song about Charles Darwin or a song about geology to the tune of ""I Love Rock and Roll."" Make sure to include all of the information you want to teach in your educational song: the catchier it is, the easier the material will be to remember.

, Every style of music has its own idiosyncrasies and stereotypes that are easy to make fun of. Pop music is repetitive and silly; metal is loud and angry; country musicians only sing about ex-girlfriends and trucks. Pick a genre of music with a lot of stereotypes that are funny and easy to exploit. Remember your target audience too: it won't make any sense to parody a classic rock song if none of your audience is old enough to remember AC/DC or Queen.

, A genre parody will require different resources than a song parody. Since you're making fun of a style of music instead of a single song, you will be able to use any instrumental track in that genre and it won't have to be well known or recognizable. Check online for databases of instrumental tracks. Some are free, while others you'll have to pay for.If you're a musician, record or make the track yourself. If you make the track, you'll have a little more creative control over your parody. You'll be able to ham up silly elements of a genre, like long breakdowns or over-the-top synthesizer choruses.

, There are many things about music genres that make them irritating or fun to parody. Subject matter of songs, attitudes of performers or aspects of the music itself can be parodied.


Make fun of the subject matter. Flight of the Concords and The Lonely Islands are two bands that love to parody stupid or silly lyrics and subject matter: check out their parodies for some examples.The more vapid, meaningless or over-the-top the subjects and lyrics of your chosen genre, the easier they will be to make fun of.
Parody the attitudes and actions of the genre's performers. Acts like Dethklok, The Rutles and Spinal Tap are great examples of this. All poke fun at the way that their genre's performers sing, act and view the world. The Rutles, for example, performed in a feature called ""All You Need is Cash,"" making fun of the Beatles commercialization. Dethklok parodies metal musicians hyper masculinity, violence and anger in the show Metalocalypse. Note that these more elaborate parodies often involve dressing and acting like the musicians, so they will be more effective if you make a music video for your parody or play a live gig.
Parody aspects of the music. Every genre has memorable and unique musical characteristics make them easy to parody. For example, you might parody excessively long guitar solos in classic rock songs, corny saxophone runs in an 80s ballad, or apocalyptic sounding rap beats.

, Even if you're just parodying a part of a genre, you'll still need a whole song's worth of lyrics. Pick a funny subject and/or a very stereotypical one for your genre: a country parody might be about having 20 tractors, while a pop parody might be about a veiled innuendo.


Consider unexpected topics. Some parodies are humorous because they introduce topics you didn't expect in a specific category. For example, Mac Sabbath perform songs in the style of Black Sabbath, but sing about fast food.You might consider writing a gangster rap song about working in an office or an easy listening song about a crazy party.

, Once you’ve nailed down a theme and a few funny phrases here and there, flesh out the rest of the song. It might take a while, and a lot of brainstorming, so get ready to be creative. Your lyrics will depend on whether you're writing a song parody or a genre parody: song parodies will require more attention to detail, while genre parodies only have to fit the backing track., Write in pencil so you can erase parts of the song if you change your mind. Don’t worry about changing the lyrics too many times: part of the creative process is getting rid of ideas when they don’t work. Listen to the song slowly, stopping the track after each phrase, writing down lyrics that come to mind., The chorus contains the hook and is the main part of the song, so start there first. Listen to the chorus as many times as you need to while writing. If you're writing a song parody, pay close attention to the flow of the words and the chorus melody. You want to match these as closely as possible., Start with the first chorus and work your way to the end of the song, counting bridges and breakdowns as verses too. You’ll want to work from the beginning to the end so that your song makes sense all the way through. It won’t be very good if you write separate verses in jumbled order and the plot of your song doesn’t make sense., The more your song sounds like the original, the better and funnier the parody will be. Your listener will immediately recognize a famous tune, but if your lyrics and rhythm don't match the original, they'll only be confused. Try to closely match the types of words and descriptions as closely as possible, listening to the song as many times as you need to.


Match the rhythm and flow of the lyrics, and don't try to cram too many words into a single phrase. More words may help you tell your story, but it won't sound much like the original song.
Try to rhyme your lyrics with the actual song. While it may be really difficult, try to rhyme the words in your song with the words in the real song. This will help it sound more like the original. Use a rhyming dictionary if you get stuck.

, The more outrageous and silly your genre parody is, the funnier it will be. In The Lonely Island’s “Jack Sparrow,” the group makes fun of rap songs with epic choruses, and the choruses get more and more ridiculous and epic each time they come around.Don’t be afraid to ham it up a little bit for comedic effect.

, The instrumental track will be the backbone of your song, so you’ll want it to be of good quality. The type of track you make or download will be different depending on which type of parody you want to make.


Find an official instrumental. If you’re parodying a current song, you’ll often be able to find an instrumental of the backing track on the artist’s album or website. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, search online for the instrumental on Soundcloud or Youtube. DJs and electronic artists often get exclusive copies of the tracks and share them.Use a karaoke track. While karaoke tracks can sound a little corny or canned, they might work well enough for what you want to make. Search karaoke archives or websites for the track that you need. You may have to pay for these tracks, however.Edit your own instrumental. It may be possible to edit the lyrics out of the song you want to parody. Certain plugins for audio editing software can remove vocals, or you can cut and paste sections of a song with no lyrics to make a word-free version. The quality of your product will depend a lot on your editing skills and the type of song.Play the song on your own instruments. If you’re skilled with a guitar, piano or other instruments, make your own backing track. Record and edit it before you lay down vocals to make sure that you have the verses and choruses in the right places.

, Use recording software and a microphone to record your vocals. Use audio editing software that came with your computer, such as Garageband, or download open source software like Audacity.


Edit your recording. Do a few takes of your vocals and then pick and choose which are best. You can edit together better performances of verses and choruses to make the best recording possible.

, Upload your song to a platform like Soundcloud, iTunes, Facebook, Myspace, Bandcamp or Youtube. This will allow many people to check out your creation. Don’t forget to spread the word across your own social media profiles. The more interest you create, the more views you’ll receive..


If you upload on Youtube, consider making a music video to complement your parody. Many popular Youtube videos are parodies, and their videos are as funny as their songs. Buy or borrow a good camera, film and edit a video to go with your song to create an even bigger impression.

Bend a wire coat hanger into a circle.,
Keep pulling on the flat sides to make something more circular — it doesn't have to be perfect.,
Pull a pair of tights or pantyhose over the circle.,
Position the filter right in front of the mic.,
Sing or talk through the filter into the mic.",How to Make a Pop Filter1," Pull the ""bottom"" of the triangle part of the hanger away from the hook like a bow and arrow. You should now have something roughly square-shaped.;
,


If you're having difficulty bending the wire, try using a pair of pliers to get a better grip. If you have a vice, you can also grab one part of the hanger in the vice and pull the other side.

, Pull them as tight as possible to get a flat, drum-like surface. Gather the extra slack around the hanger's hook. Use tape or rubber band to hold the slack and keep the stretched portion tight.

, You want it about an inch or two away from the mic. It should not be touching it.It should sit between your mouth and the mic when you're recording. There's no ""right"" way to do this — anything you can do to get the new filter to stay in front of the mic is fair game. A few ideas are below!


If you like, you can straighten out the hanger's hook and bend it into a wide curve, then tape the end to a spot on the mic stand behind the mic. Bend the wire as needed to get the screen in exactly the right spot.
Use a clamp to hold the filter to the mic stand. You can get small, cheap clamps from most hardware stores for just a few dollars.Tape the filter to a second mic stand and position this in front of the first.
Keep in mind that some mics are designed to take in sound from the top, while others are designed to take in sound from the front. You want the filter directly in front of the recording surface of the mic.

, Now, you're ready to record. Turn on your recording equipment and stand or sit so that the filter is between you and the mic. Your mouth should be a few inches from the filter. Break a leg!


Listen to the way your ""P,"" ""B,"" ""S,"" and ""Ch"" sounds come out on your recording. You shouldn't hear any ""clipping"" with these sounds as long as your volume levels are configured correctly. By contrast, not using a pop filter can leave your recording riddled with distortion. Click here for a good, semi-technical guide to clipping (and how to avoid it!)"

Obtain a embroidery hoop filter.

,
Stretch nylon embroidery material across a sewing hoop.,
Alternatively, use screen door material.,
Position the hoop in front of the mic.",How to Make a Pop Filter2,", A sewing or embroidery hoop is a simple hoop made from metal and/or plastic that holds a piece of fabric in place when you're sewing. Any size hoop will work, but a hoop of about six inches across will be the same size as most pop filters.


Embroidery hoops usually have a fairly simple latch on one side. Undo this latch and slip the fabric over the inner hoop so that it stretches beyond its edges on all sides. Seat the inner hoop back inside the outer hoop and close the latch, keeping the fabric tight. See our embroidery hoop article for more help.

, It may seem counter-intuitive, but stiffer fabrics tend to make better pop filters. If you have the tight metal or plastic netting that's usually stretched across the open spaces of screen doors, this works especially well.Simply stretch it across the embroidery hoop as you would with the embroidery fabric.


Screen door mesh can be found at most large hardware stores. It's cheap, but you may be forced to buy a roll of the material, rather than the small amount that you actually need., Now, all you need to do is move your new pop filter into position. As in the section above, one easy way to do this is to tape, glue, or clamp the outside the hoop to a free mic stand. You can also attach the hoop to a stick or a straightened-out coat hanger and then attach this behind the microphone.


Sing or talk through the filter and into the mic as normal. With this method, the filter is only one layer thick, but this is OK. It should work just as well.

Take the plastic lid off of a large can of coffee.,
Cut the middle of the lid out, leaving the rim.,
Stretch pantyhose or nylon material tight across the gap.,
Use the filter as directed above.",How to Make a Pop Filter3," In this method, you'll use a coffee can lid to make a circular frame for fabric that will act as the filter. Many different sizes can work, but in general, wide, stiff lids of six inches across work well.



Stiffer plastic lids are best. Flexible, floppy lids are not ideal.

, Use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut out the entire center portion of the lid. When you're done, you should have a stiff plastic hoop. Through the cut-out center part of the lid away.


For the stiffest plastic lids, you may need to use a drill, awl, or saw to get started. Be very careful when using these tools. A heavy pair of work gloves and proper eye protection are musts.

, Now that you have a stiff hoop of plastic, all you need to do is make the filter with a tight layer of porous fabric. Pantyhose or tights work very well. Simply slide a stocking over the hoop, pull it tight, gather the slack at the bottom, and secure it with rubber bands or tape.


You can also use embroidery material or screen door mesh like in the section above, but this is a little harder. You can use clamps, binder clips, or tape along the back of the rim to keep these materials reasonably tight.

, Your pop filter is now ready to use. Use tape or clamps to position it in front of the mic just like you would for the methods above.

Drink water.,
Breath down low.,
Tighten your diaphragm when you sing.,
Keep good posture.",How to Make Your Singing Voice Sound Better1," If you think drinking water is only good for physical fitness, newsflash: it's great for vocal health, too. Load up on the H20 to keep your vocal folds hydrated, healthy, and ready to go.


Avoid any liquids at extreme temperatures. Anything too cold and your vocal folds will tense up; too hot and they may get irritated.
If you are experiencing a tickle, warm teas or warm water with honey is fine. If you drink milk every morning, drink water after that, as dairy products coat your throat. As always, avoid alcohol. It dehydrates you and your voice.;
, Most people have a nasty habit of sucking their stomachs in and breathing just with the tops of their lungs. In order to get a strong, healthy singing voice, you must utilize the rest of your lungs and diaphragm, breathing low and deep.


This is true whether you're sitting, standing, or lying down. While standing or sitting, place a hand on your stomach and force it out with every inhale and in again with every exhale. If you are lying down, place a book on your chest and make sure it doesn't move.

, This will make your voice stronger. (If you don't know what the diaphragm is, look it up! It is a muscle just under the ribs!)

, Keep both of your feet flat on the ground and imagine a string over your head, holding your body in line. In order for air to flow easily through your system, you must maintain good posture.


If you're sitting, don't use the back of your chair and do not cross your legs. Remember: You're using all of your lungs. Slouching makes this very difficult to do.

Practice breathing exercises.,
Warm up adequately.,
Modify your vowels.,
Take chances.,
Sing in your range.",How to Make Your Singing Voice Sound Better2," A note can't be good if you can't sustain it. Before you work on your voice, you have to work on your breathing. Just like holding your breath comes easier with time, so does prolonged expulsion.


Start by breathing in for 4 counts and exhaling for 8. Increase the exhale by 4 until you hit 28. You're not stretching the capacity of your lungs; you are learning how to control the air.

Breathing out on a hiss will make it easier to control the air and give a tonal quality to the power behind it.



, You wouldn't start a marathon without training, would you? Your vocal folds are muscles too! Show them the respect they deserve by warming up.


Start on middle C and practice going down in half steps until you hit the bottom of your range, working major scales. Then, take it back up to the top of your range. Use phrases like, ""Mommy made me mash my M&Ms"" to switch it up from the normal solfege (do, re, mi...).
Practice lip trills and sirens. Start near the bottom of your range and slide your way up. This is especially useful for opening up the higher range.

As you do your siren, use your arms to give the higher range a physicality. Often it's easier to hit high notes if you can ""see"" them.



, Too many pop singers are guilty of being overly nasal. If you modify your vowels, your voice will have a more classic, darker, developed tone that is more likely to sound trained.


Practice with multiple consonants. Start on ma, me, mi, mo, moo (that's pronounced like mah, meh, mih, moh, moo), and move to ta, te, ti, to(h), too. Then on with ""z,"" ""k,"" and ""sh."" At the ""oo"" sound, move up or down a half step and repeat until you hit the extremes of your range.

Each voice has a vowel that makes it easier to reach higher notes. Experiment to see which one makes it easiest for you.



, Say you have a huge break between your chest voice and head voice; because of this, you avoid those three or four dangerous notes at all costs. As a result, the quality of those notes becomes very weak. In order to improve, you must take risks.


Go outside your comfort zone. If you're not comfortable with a certain range or length of note, practice it. It is the only way you will get better. Control will come with time. With enough practice, you'll be able to manipulate your voice into doing exactly what you want.

, Sometimes our voices just aren't meant for certain notes. If you find yourself straining, either drop an octave or find a note in harmony.


Listen to what your voice is telling you. You may want horribly to be a soprano, but it just may not be in the cards. But remember: Your range does not determine how good your voice is. Sing with what you have--don't try to be something you're not.

Find a vocal coach.,
Look for resources.,
Experiment with genres.",How to Make Your Singing Voice Sound Better3," Having a professional guide you in your healthy singing habits is the ultimate resource. Consult your arts teachers at your school or music stores for information.


Often universities have students who are training to be vocal teachers offer lessons at a reduced fee. These students are taking pedagogy classes and are anxious for students of their own.
If you aren't interested in one-on-one work or can't afford it, consider joining your local or school choir.

, There is a ton of information to be found online (apart from wikiHow, sadly). Search for videos, different schools of thought regarding training, and websites on extra tips and tricks.

, It's possible your voice isn't suited for the genres you listen to. Find songs you wouldn't normally hear on your iPod and see how your voice responds.


Each voice has a different quality about it. Country singers often have a twang; jazz singers are often a bit smokey. Take the qualities of your voice and run with it.
It is said that classical singers can sing everything, but pop singers can only sing pop. If you are looking to train, look into classical teachers to give you a well-balanced repertoire.

Find a good voice teacher.,
Always listen to your vocal teacher.,
Let your teacher know if a song isn't working for you.,
Don't be afraid to sing in different languages.,
Practice!!,
Understand what the lyrics mean.,
Listen to famous classical or opera singers.",How to Learn Vocal Music," This isn't completely necessary, but a vocal teacher should be able to tell you how much work you have to do to make your voice classical and should be able to give you some good classical music to start out with.;
, You don't have an accurate perception of what your voice sounds like, so just trust your teacher. Also, if you're beginning classical music, you simply don't have the expertise to brush off your teacher's advice.

, The only way that you will enjoy classical music and truly understand how awesome it is if you are singing a song you enjoy. You'll practice more, and it will be more fun!

, It might be intimidating at first, but much, if not most of classical music is in a different language. If you aren't familiar with the language, that's okay! Just keep an open mind.

, It's simple, but a lot of people don't realize how difficult singing is. To be a successful classical singer, you have to put in some effort.

, If it's in a different language, get a translation! If it's in English, analyze it. To make real music, there has to be emotion. If you don't understand the lyrics, then you'll just be rattling off a bunch of notes!

, Most have great technique and can serve as inspiration for a beginner.

Set a goal for your voice.,
Practice singing your favorite songs, recording and playing back the tracks.,
Sing songs within your range, or comfort zone.,
Stay hydrated and avoid smoking and alcohol before singing.",How to Learn to Sing Pop Without Getting a Teacher1," Pop singers have a large amount of variability and tones, from traditionally beautiful singers like Adele up against modern, more unique voices like John Mayer or Bruno Mars. Think about the songs you love and want to sing: do you want to work on epic, dramatic songs or more fun, loose bits.What does your natural singing voice sound like? Try to use this to your advantage instead of fighting it. Mick Jagger doesn't have an amazing voice, but he and the Rolling Stones rode the top of the pop charts for decades because he uses his growly, high-energy style to it's fullest potential.
Singing like Adele, Beyonce, Michael Buble, and other ""classic"" voices generally takes years of training. While you can learn without a teacher, these voices are very hard to develop without professional help.;
, Your voice sounds different to others than it does to you, and you need to hear both versions to find out where you miss notes or need improvement. Make sure you turn the background music as much as possible, as the original singer can cover up your mistakes if you're not careful. Listen to the recordings, then work on trouble areas until you can sing them fluidly.


Sing whatever you want to sing -- there is no ""right"" style for pop singers.

, Your range is the group of notes you can hit comfortably without cracking or missing notes. A large range covers both high and low notes, like Marvin Gaye's famous 3-octave range. A small range sticks to simple, easy notes, like Joe Strummer's infamous 3-note range. Any range can work in pop music, but only if you know yours and know how to stay in it. The better your singing technique, the better your range.


Hit your highest notes without cracking or struggling -- this is the top of your range.
Hit the lowest note you can -- this is the bottom of your range.
Practicing can expand your range. Working on higher and lower notes will pay off, as you can teach yourself to grow your range with proper technique.

, Vocal chords are living cells and need to be healthy to perform well. As such, proper hydration is one of the small, secret keys to unlocking your best vocal potential. Furthermore, alcohol, tobacco, and even dairy products will hamper your chords ability to move freely, limiting your range.Make sure you start drinking at least 30 minutes before performing so that your body has time to absorb the water.

Stand upright, with your head up, chest out, and joints relaxed for the best singing posture.,
Focus on moving air from your chest while singing.,
Use your abdomen for breathing, moving air through the belly.,
Focus on deep, even streams of air to control your breathing.,
Keep your eyes and ears out for common breathing mistakes.",How to Learn to Sing Pop Without Getting a Teacher2," A tall, open posture is key to unlocking your best singing voice. Practice in front of a mirror, looking from the front and side, to make sure you're up straight and following the best posture guidelines:Remember:


Shoulders back.
Chin level with the floor.
Chest out.
Stomach flat.
Joints relaxed., You should feel pressure in your chest, as if you voice is coming from your pec muscles, instead of your head or neck. When you sing in your ""head voice,"" you can feel your voice up in your throat and head, as if there was a little vibration there. Work on ""moving"" this vibration around, playing with your voice until you feel it in your chest. This is the feeling you want when singing.


You want to move air from your diaphragm, not your throat, head, or mouth.

, When you breathe, breath ""horizontally,"" with your stomach moving out as you inhale and in as your exhale. Working from your belly keeps your chest steady and helps control your air.Imagine you're wearing a belt around your belly. As you inhale, it slides down to make room for more air. As you exhale, it slides up your belly to move air up through your chest and out your mouth.In ""normal"" breathing, your chest moves. But singers need a solid, unmoving chest to keep a steady stream of air coming.

, Regular breathing is short and shallow -- as you rarely need a ton of oxygen. Singers, however, need to save their air to sing with. To do so, focus on big, quick inhalations and slow, even exhales. As you sing, you want to imagine one continuous, unchanging stream of air coming out. It takes work, but this is perhaps the single best thing you can do to become a better pop singer.When inhaling, think of just opening your whole throat to let air in, instead of trying to suction it in. It is much more effective this way.

, The sooner you notice these issues and fix them, the faster you'll learn to sing any genre effectively. Each of these issues is likely something you've done or felt yourself doing because they feel like good ideas. However, you'll notice the difference once you make corrections.



Tanking up: This is when people try to fill their lungs extra big. But better singers just release their air with slow, even breaths to make their air last longer, not fill up with more of it.

Pushing the air: You want to think of ""letting"" the air out gently, not forcing it.

Holding back air: Think of how a car jerks right when you hit the gas. This is when a singer stops their voice right between inhaling and exhaling. You want to work on breathing “into” your note, silently exhaling air quickly just before starting to sing so that the note slides out smoothly."
"
Warm-up before singing, always.,
Open your mouth wide for notes in the low register.,
Lift your cheeks and push from the throat and nose to hit higher notes in the register.,
""Belt out"" big notes by building strength and comfort in the high register.,
Consider learning a piano or guitar to accompany yourself, or join a band.",How to Learn to Sing Pop Without Getting a Teacher3," Your vocal chords are similar to muscles, and they need to be loose and warm to stretch to their fullest. Never go into a song or show without at least 5-10 minutes of simple exercises, like these:


Hum. Humming activates your breath without straining your vocal chords.Trill your lips and tongue to warm up your mouth and jaw (ie. roll your r’s)
Begin with a simple scale, going up and down slowly (doh – mi – sol – mi – doh).
Begin with the easiest songs you are going to practice, waiting 10-15 minutes to tackle the tougher parts.

, When singing in a low register, make sure you sing with an open mouth. Practice in front of a mirror to make sure you're doing this. Don't force your voice, but sing with abdominal support throughout. To strengthen your low register, exercise using a descending scale, repeating and descending semitone by semitone.


If you don't know scales, practice with the classic ""Do-re-mi-fah-so-la-tee-doh,"" lowering your voice at each interval. You could also simply pick a phrase, like ""la la la la"" to work through.

, When singing in a high register, smile and lift your cheeks. Imagine the sound is coming from the space behind your nose, and try to produce a sound like a witch's cackle. Exercise using ascending scales, placing an 'n' sound in front of a vowel. The 'n' will help push the sound into your high register.


Practice songs you like that hit this high register. Lower the background music so you can really hear yourself and know if you're actually hitting the notes cleanly.

, Singers like Ariana Grande, Celine Dion, Beyonce, Mariah Carey, and Christina Aguilera will often belt out their top notes. Belting is essentially a form of shout-singing. When belting, support your voice by holding in your abdominal muscles and sing in your high register rather than pushing up from the bottom of your voice.


Belting out big notes takes practice. Keep working on hitting normal high notes cleanly, then practice these bigger notes at shows or when you feel comfortable. They will come.

, Pop singing is actually as much about the vocals as the performance. If you want to learn to sing pop songs, you'll need to get out there and really start singing pop. You'll have far more opportunities if you can play an instrument too, or have instruments behind you.


When singing pop, use the mic to your advantage. If you think you're about to miss a note, lean back ""dramatically,"" away from the mic. Need a little more volume, a growl, or some distortion -- get right into the mic and or cup it with your hand while singing.

Ask your choir director to sign you up.,
Get a music track.,
Practice.,
Use your musicality.,
Make cuts in the music.,
Pass your classes.,
Don't get nervous.",How to Make a Region Choir," You will have to go through a small amount of paperwork, but your director should be the one who does the real signing up.


Chances are, there will also be fees to pay (an audition fee and a cost for the real sheet music). You can still use copies of the sheet music, but you can't be considered as ""legit"" until you have the real thing.;
, If you have an awesome choir director, he or she will make one for you. It should have your section part being sung by a professional on each song, the accompaniment of each song, the mix down of each song (full choir sound), and sometimes a word pronouncement guide.


Put this track everywhere you can: your iPod, your phone, your computer, your email, a CD and your flash drive. You need to listen and practice wherever and whenever you can.

, Start as soon as you get your sheet music. If you have time after school, practice. If you have a blow off class, get permission to go and practice in the choir room.


If your parents hate your nonstop singing, then try accessing the music in your room and practice every time they or you are not at home. Notes and rhythms are the basics of learning this music. Make them perfect.

, Make an obvious dynamic contrast, and overdo everything, even the diction.


Spit out the consonants and keep very tall vowels. No matter how dumb you feel, you can never overdo musicality as long as you make smooth transitions.
If there are not many dynamic markings, ask your choir director to sing how it should be sung and mark your music how they sound, with crescendo marks, piano, forte, etc.
Put emphasis on down beats and actions. If your music is in English, and you can understand foreign language, you'd stress a word like waken or remember.
Record yourself. You'd be amazed how dumb you sound to yourself, but how perfect you sound with overdone musicality to others.

, Write down times in the music (2:24) and then go back, find a section and sing a snippet of the song. This is how the audition is. You won't get to sing the whole song. The cuts are a minute or less, so make it good in the small time you've got to prove yourself. Your choir teacher might even make pretend cuts for you.

, Region choir is a UIL thing, and that means you have to be eligible in order to compete. Have a 70 or higher by your grade check, keep your grades up or all that practice will go to waste.

, On audition day, there will be many people. Don't let that fact or they themselves intimidate you.


There will be snots there who are rude or act like they're all that and a bag of chips. The person auditioning before you may even sing like an angel. Don't let anything phase you.
Tell yourself whatever you need to hear and remember the end reward. This can vary from passion of singing to pride to the attractive singers you get to perform with. In the room, judges shouldn't be able to see you, so if it helps, dance or direct with your song.
Go over your music when waiting. If you mess up a little in the audition, ignore it, get back on track and move on. Also, don't forget your music that you've marked all over. You'll need it.

Foster strong relationships in the a cappella community.",How to Lead an A Cappella Group," In order to figure out what kind of practice schedule, policies, and performances your group will have, you need to determine what your a cappella group wants to accomplish. Have a meeting with all members and ask everyone what they want out of the group. Do you want to win a prestigious competition or eventually make money as performing and recording artists? Or is this mainly a recreational venture in which you're aiming to perform a few times a year?;
, As the leader of your group, you need to make sure that all members know what the group does, what it’s striving for, and what is expected of each member individually. Make a schedule and general list of guidelines that includes rules for participation, rehearsal and gig calendars, arrangements, and contact information for everyone in the group.Remember to keep all of this information up to date, and also to repeat this process every time you take a new member on board.
Also be sure to include clear policies about the consequences for violating these rules or missing rehearsals. If there are no repercussions for shirked responsibilities, members won’t take your group seriously.

, In order to assign roles and coordinate arrangements effectively, you need to know the vocal range of each of your members, what kinds of things they do best, and what assignments are probably best left to someone else. Listen to each member do some solos and schedule some one-on-one time with each member during every rehearsal.

, While you’re still new at leading an a cappella group, you can start by using written arrangements that others have made. You’ll be able to get some valuable experience under your belt as well as provide the group some practice using established, sound arrangements.


There are several resources you can use to find arrangements for your group. Check out the CASA arrangement library online, a cappella listservs, and a cappella sheet music from such publishers as UNC Jazz Press and Hal Leonard., As the leader of a group of musicians, your own musical skills should be on the top of their game. Make sure you can sing on pitch and in rhythm, even if others around you aren't. Also, be sure that you have at least basic music theory skills, such as which key signature has two sharps, and how the tenor note on beat three fits into the chord.


It’s an added bonus if you have some basic piano skills, as these will help you lead rehearsals.

, The most essential element of building a solid a cappella group dynamic is practice time. If your group is striving to become a professional ensemble, you should sing together every day or every other day for at least the first year.If your group is more of a hobby than a serious commitment, take a poll of your members as to how often and for how long they'd like to practice. For example, ask everyone if they'd like to practice weekly, biweekly, monthly, or only in a seldom, ad hoc fashion.


If you have to meet less frequently, that’s okay. Just know that your group won’t gel as quickly and it will take more time to prepare for performances.

, You want your group to look to you as a strong leader, but you don’t want them to foist all responsibility onto you. The best way to make every member feel invested in the group and accountable for its success is to share responsibility amongst everyone. Take turns picking and leading songs or, if your group is more advanced, have different members contribute their original arrangements., Your group might be chock-full of natural talent, but everyone should know at least some basic principles and techniques, such as the six vocal resonators, proper breathing, and the Alexander technique. This will make it so that each member can practice individually without developing any bad habits.Don’t assume that it’s enough to provide some print-outs or other educational materials. Rather, devote a chunk of each rehearsal to musical education so that you can be sure that everyone learns the pertinent content.

, While your group should spend the majority of the time together singing, going over arrangements, and learning musical concepts, you should also set some time aside to just get to know each other. Schedule a half hour after every other rehearsal to sit around and chat, or arrange a separate get-together for everyone to meet and see a movie or do something else fun.This is particularly important if your members are from disparate circles and don’t know one another very well. Building trust and solid interpersonal bonds will improve your group’s morale and even sharpen your performances.

, In order to book gigs for your group, you need to get some momentum going. Hang some flyers on bulletin boards at local coffee shops, post information about upcoming appearances on the personal social media accounts of your members, and upload videos of your performances to personal YouTube accounts.You should also take advantage of any local talent shows, competitions, or events sponsored by organizations to which one or more of your members belong. For example, if you all go to the same college, sign up for the school’s yearly Battle of the Bands, or see if you can take part in the annual holiday caroling event or final exam study break.

, While posting group information on personal social media accounts is helpful in that it reaches friends and acquaintances, you should also set up a separate account for your group. This will create a centralized virtual presence for your group and help you develop a fan base, something particularly important in the recent, tech-savvy revival of a cappella popularity.If you’re struggling to garner views of your group’s uploaded videos, try a new angle that will attract more than just hardcore a cappella fans. Gather for an impromptu, flash-mob like sing-along in a crowded mall or cover a particularly popular pop song that will appeal to fans of the original artist.
If all else fails, you might want to consider paid advertisement options on Facebook or Twitter or hiring an email marketer in order to reach a wider audience., It would be nice to get paid right away for your group’s smooth vocal stylings, but chances are that you’ll need to sing for free at least a few times before you land a paid gig (if that's what your group is looking for).After all, bars, dance halls, and other musical venues want to know that you’ll bring a fair amount of business into their establishment. You can persuade them of your group’s viability by providing a video reel of your group’s performances that shows large, enthusiastic crowds in attendance.


Your social media stats will be helpful in this process as well. If you can show a venue promoter or booking manager that your group’s Facebook page has been visited and Liked a few thousand times in the past month, you’re much more likely to convince someone of your group’s popularity and potential.

, Before your group’s first performance, you should gather all your members to figure out what kind of look your group will have. Ask if everyone wants to dress in matching outfits for a coordinated effect, or if they’d prefer to wear different outfits for a more casual style. You want everyone to be on the same page, otherwise your group will look unorganized and unprofessional.


Even if your group decides to go with casual, uncoordinated outfits, make sure that you enforce some basic guidelines. For example, ban ripped or frayed items, graphic tees, or other outfit elements which can distract from your group’s singing.

, Whether you’ve booked a paid gig or a free spot on open-mic night, you want your group’s performance to be technically flawless and memorable. This means that you should opt for simple, cleanly performed arrangements rather than complex arrangements which contain more than a few hiccups in the execution.


You can make your performance memorable by prioritizing originality. If you’re advanced enough that you can make your own, original arrangement, do it! If not, you can still pick a fresh song and arrangement rather than singing a tried-and-true a cappella classic like Africa or Pompeii.This rule also applies to your group’s styling and stage moves. While some choreography, joking around, and special effects can enhance your performance, you should focus first and foremost on the music.

, Whether you’ve just performed at a small coffee shop, in a long festival. lineup, or at a tough collegiate competition, remember that your group’s success depends just as much on what you do after the show as what you do during. There are many online and in-person organizations and events which are perfect for networking in the a capella world.Talk to other groups and musicians, chat up the club owner and get their contact information, and join an online listserv or Facebook group that will get you involved in the a cappella community.

This means that, if you want to hear yourself how others do, you must record it back to yourself.This is the easiest, most private, and fastest way to find out if you can sing naturally.


You don't have to use fancy microphones or recording technology to find out if you've got a good set of pipes. Most computers and smart phones have built-in microphones and voice recording software. Alternatively, you can go analog and use a basic cassette voice recorder or go really old school and record your voice onto someone else's answering message.
If you're nervous showing off your singing in front of others, this is a great way to get around the performance anxiety. Nobody needs to hear your recording but you; you can sing your heart out without fear of judgement.;
, Despite what the auditions on American Idol and other talent shows would have you believe, singing a cappella (without accompaniment) isn't the best way to figure out whether or not you've got a good singing voice. It's important to give yourself a guide track, like a blank karaoke track, to find out whether or not you can match tones and stay in tune while you're singing. Blank karaoke tracks are readily available online, specifically on YouTube.


You can find simple, free, online MIDI versions of pop songs and old standards that you might like to sing. They might not sound like hits, but they'll give you a tune to work with. Also check out the pre-programmed tracks on Casio keyboards, or the instrumental version of songs from albums you might have.

, Once you've chosen your song and your recorder, find a nice quiet place to try out your singing. This way you won't have to worry about whether or not anyone will be hearing your voice and judging you. Cue up your track and hit record.


If you've got a basement, or a garage, sneak out and settle in, or wait until you'll get some alone time. You could also just sit in the car for a while and record yourself there.
Remember, you're not trying to record a hit to put on the radio. You're just trying to evaluate how good your singing voice is. Don't worry about getting it all right, or the quality of the recording.

, Good singing isn't about doing those vocal acrobatics that Mariah Carey does. If you can't do that, don't worry. It's much better to be able to sing simply and carry a song in tune. Forget about warbling your voice with vibrato and flying all over the place. Just sing the song in its simplest form, or just how you sing it comfortably.

, This is your moment of truth! After you've got your recording, take a deep breath and press play. Listen to how well you move through the chord changes in the song, whether you're able to follow the tune and hit all the notes the song requires.


Listen to the track in a variety of ways. Check it out on your cheap computer speakers, then plug the track in and listen to your car speakers, then check it out on headphones. Some things don't sound good on cheap, tiny speakers, but sound better coming through high quality headphones. Listen closely and listen a few times.

, Voices aren't all alike, and we can't all sing songs in the same range. That's why choirs are made up from different kinds of voices, and songs are written for different vocal ranges. If your recording doesn't sound great, that might be because you chose a song you like instead of one that is in your range.


Download a cheap tuning app that analyzes your voice and sing in your normal vocal range. When you sing alone, what feels most comfortable? Sing that. Check out where it registers on the vocal tuner.
Then try singing your lowest note and your highest note and note those on paper. Figure out how many notes are between your low and your high and you'll have some idea of your range. Pick a song that fits that range.

, Tone deafness is a real thing. Some people aren't able to hear a tone and simultaneously match their voice to that tone which is, of course, a skill required for accurate singing. In addition to recording your voice and listening to the playback, take a quick, free, online tone-deafness test.

, You've given yourself your best shot at finding out whether you can sing: you picked a song within your range, learned out to sing it using the right technique, and practiced until you had it memorized. Now it's time to put your voice to the test in front of your family.


Pick a room that will help you present your voice at its best. A large room with high ceilings will make your voice sound better than a carpeted basement with low ceilings will.
If you get nervous or embarrassed, stop singing and start over. You aren't in Carnegie Hall; this is about your voice, not your stage fright issues. Those can be addressed later.
When your performance is finished, ask your family to give you an honest opinion. No matter what they say, you should probably take it with a grain of salt; they may try to save your feelings or give you a good ribbing, as families sometimes do. However, their reaction should give you an inkling about whether your voice is good. If you feel confident enough to keep going, it's time to take it to the next level.

, There are many opportunities to perform in public: you can go to an open mic night at a club or lounge, sign up for a talent show, or do karaoke. Find a venue that works for you and prepare to sing a song for strangers.


As you sing, watch the crowd's reaction. They aren't as invested as your family in making sure you walk away with your self-esteem intact, so you may be able to get a better sense of whether your voice is easy on the ears.
Have a friend in the crowd ask some strangers whether they thought you were a good singer. Random strangers don't always appreciate being polled, so you shouldn't place your singing future in their hands; just collect opinions and continue taking steps to determine whether you have a good singing voice.

, Another way to get feedback from the public is by busking in a train station or in a busy shopping area. If you can, set up a microphone and a small amplifier so that people will be attracted to your singing. You can sing for free or set out a hat or bowl in front of your setup to make a little cash while you conduct this personal experiment.


Choose a popular, seasonal song to draw more people in.
If people seem to avoid the area instead of drawing closer, your voice may not sound appealing. This could simply be a result of bad amplification, so don't let it completely dishearten you.
Don't base your conclusion on how much money you make or how many people gather around. Commuters and busy shoppers don't always take the time to stop and acknowledge buskers, but that doesn't mean they didn't like the sound of your voice.

, If you have a wonderful singing voice, you will know it by now. If not, you'll likely also know it. But, just as a guitar player has to go through an awkward period of fumbling over the strings, singers have to work hard at singing to improve their voices. It's not something that you're born with. It's something you can work on with dedication and practice.


If someone tells you that you can't sing, but you've got a passion to work on your voice, then continue practicing and working hard to get your voice improved. Don't listen to the noise. Even so, some people can just never sing no matter how hard they practice. You should already know if this is you.

, Paying someone to teach you how to use your voice as an instrument can make a big difference in how well you sing. Choose an instructor you can trust to give you honest feedback about your ability.

, If you've concluded that you don't have natural singing ability, but you love to sing, keep working at it. Your instructor will be able to help you make the most of the vocal chords you were born with. The joy of singing is available to everyone who wants it, not just people who are naturally gifted.

, Singing as part of a choir is an excellent way to determine whether you have a good singing voice. You'll get feedback from the choir director and the other members of the choir, and you may get the chance to hear your voice as part of a professional recording.


Jump at the chance to sing a solo. You'll get more one-on-one instruction from the choir director, and when you perform you'll get more feedback than you would as part of the group.
Talk with the choir director about ways to increase your singing ability. You could also ask the director point blank if he or she thinks you have singing talent.

Think of it this way: football players never go out on the field before a game without stretching to warm up their muscles. It is the same concept for vocalists before a performance. A good singer always takes his or her voice through the motions before rehearsing or performing. This can be done by singing on a vowel and changing keys each time, while going up and down the scale.;
,, Never push your voice outside its comfortable range unless it has been permitted or asked of you by a professional vocal teacher.

,, This can be done most easily by smiling in order to lift your cheekbones, which will in turn lift your hard palate. You should feel a sensation of openness in the throat, which is very similar to yawning, when you breathe.

, Sing from your diaphragm.ÃÂ Keep a hand there the first few times you try to sing from there if you don't know exactly where it is, or ask a vocal teacher for help if you really can't find it. It's very easy to find, though.


Sit up straight and gasp. The area in your abdomen that ""hiccups"" when you gasp is your diaphragm.

, Though dairy is important to most healthy balanced diets, dairy products produce blockage in the larynx in the form of phlegm, which coats the larynx and vocal cords. Never consume dairy before a performance.

, Acidic foods such as citrus fruits can wear down the vocal folds. Try to cut back on acids if you want to keep your voice healthy.

, This is very important.

, Dehydration affects the entire body, so even if you feel hydrated, as a singer you should drink as much water as possible, as often as possible.

, This is crucial. Refrain from singing, speaking, and whispering if possible. Stay home.

, Buy a personal steamer and use it religiously when you're sick. It will relieve your pain, lessen congestion, and deliver moisture to your vocal cords without overwhelming them. It will also loosen phlegm.

, Ricola is probably the most commonly used lozenge brand among singers because it is natural. Vocalzone throat lozenges are good, as well. Make sure these lozenges have pure, naturally-derived ingredients.

, This will give your voice more time to repair itself.

, This drink is a lifesaver. Some singers like to add lemon to the honey water; however, this acidic fruit may damage your already-sensitive voice.

Practice scales.,
Start easy.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice Without Taking Singing Lessons1," Yes, practice your party dance groove motion. It might seem boring at first, but it really will help train your ear to recognize the right notes, making you a better singer. You're probably familiar with the song ""Do Re Me"" from The Sound of Music, which is actually a good song to practice with. The basis of this song is something called solfège, which is great for ear training.


In solfège, the notes in a scale are named by positional names, instead of the actual note names. This makes it easy to sing the notes, no matter what the key you're singing in. In the key of C, the first three notes are C, D, and E. In the key of F#, however, the first three notes are F#, G#, A#. In both cases, with solfège, the first three notes just happen to be, ""Do, Re, Mi.""
If you have a guitar or piano, use it to help guide you and make sure you're staying in tune. If not, you can use an online resource such as Virtual Piano to assist you.;
, Sing your ""do re mi""s up and down the scales. Start with the C scale, then the C# scale, and on up. It looks like this, with solfège:


Basic scale: Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do

Then mix it up: go up two notes, and down one, working your way up the scale.
Up two, down one: Do Mi Re Fa Mi Sol Fa La Sol Ti La Do Ti Re Do

Start slowly and deliberately, and strive to hit the right note instead of sliding into it. This will help you get control of your voice, and you can use your instrument to make sure you're staying on pitch. It's much better to be very slow, and very accurate, than fast and sloppy.

If your computer doesn't have a built-in mic, they can be very inexpensive, and can be found at any electronics store. Connect it to your computer.

,, It might help to have the lyrics in front of you. The key is to know the lyrics by heart, so that you aren't thinking about what to sing, only how to sing.

, When you're ready, rewind the song to the beginning, then click the Record button (usually a red dot) on your sound recorder.


Sing along with the artist. Do the best you can, focusing on your breath and on singing the notes correctly (keeping the notes at the same pitch as the artist).
If you make a mistake, no matter how horrible, don't stop recording—go all the way to the end of the song. There is time enough later be perfect—for now, practice is what's most important.
When the song is finished, click on the black rectangle or press the spacebar (which stops most sound recording applications).
Rewind your recorder, pressing the arrow button that points left and has a vertical bar at the tip.

, At first, you probably won't like it. Get over it and listen to it all; it's the only way you can understand what mistakes you make and what you need to improve about your voice.


Listen critically, and recognize both your mistakes and where you nailed it.
Play the original song again (no singing or recording this time), and compare your voice to the artist's. Play one part that's sung by the original artist, then play the same part, sung by you this time. Notice the differences.

, Saving the recordings to the same song on a longer period of time helps you track your progress. When you improve (and you will improve!), listening to the old recordings will let you hear just how far you've come.

, Each time you record yourself singing this song, try to be more careful while singing. Be more passionate, or heartfelt, or whatever emotion the song is conveying—try to feel that part and make it your own.


Unless you're practicing for a cover band, make the song your own! You don't have to sing it with the same inflections and expression as the original singer. Not all popular singers are good singers—they're just popular.

, More is better—as long as you're not straining your voice, which could damage it. The more you exercise your vocal cords, the better and stronger your voice will be.

, From the diaphragm, in the throat, in the nose: learn to isolate each type of sound you make. The more you know about how make sounds, the more you'll be able to control those sounds.

, A great way to improve your voice is to sing ""meow"""" in different pitch each time. It is helpful because it contains all the major English vowel sounds (mee, ah, oo) which help when you sing aloud.


Say ""meow"" very slowly, and feel where it resonates in your mouth, nose, chest, etc.

, Everyone has to sing as though they are shouting in some point in their career, but you have to practice to get it to sound powerful and energetic, instead of desperate or screaming.

, For example, visit YouTube. There are plenty of resources from people who simply love to share their knowledge. Some may also be selling their products, but those aren't necessary if they aren't what you want or need.


Ask friends and family, or your local music teacher to give you tips. Ask for their complete honesty, so they don't feel like they're required to praise you. In fact, if they do, thank them and then ask them to tell you where you need to improve.

Consider online vocal lessons.",How to Learn to Sing Bass1," The best way to learn how to sing bass is by taking voice lessons. Search online for vocal teachers in your area. For example, search for “voice teachers in New York City.”;
, Not all voice teachers will be suitable for a bass singer. Ask the teacher if they have experience working with or training bass vocalists. The best teachers can typically work with a wide range of singers. You also want a teacher who focuses on teaching vocal techniques not just songs and repertoire.Avoid a teacher who only works with one type of vocalist.

, If you have found a suitable teacher in your area, try taking in-person voice lessons. Explain to the instructor that you are interested in learning how to sing bass and that you want to work on techniques to help you develop the lower range of your voice.Voice lessons typically cost between $30 and $75 dollars for a half hour session.

, In some instances you may not be able to find an appropriate voice teacher close by. Instead, try taking vocal lessons online. There are lots of instructors who will teach one-on-one classes completely online using webcams."

Identify your vocal range.,

Listen to other bass singers.",How to Learn to Sing Bass2," Have your vocal instructor play a range of notes on the piano in ascending and descending order. Try and mimic the notes until you reach a note that's beyond your range. This will allow you to identify your range. Alternatively, you can download an application that can help determine your range.When you are first learning to sing bass, your range is typically low. For instance, you may only be able to sing a middle range octave with a few notes on either side.

, A bass vocalist should be able to comfortably sing the notes C4 to E4. Work with your vocal teacher to expand your range so that you can sing these notes. Focus particularly on creating an even tone for each note.Try singing scales at the lower end of your range that you are comfortable with and then gradually go lower. Practice these scales daily., Bass singers typically sing with a chest voice instead of a head voice. This means that the sound resonates lower in the mouth and chest. The sound is often deeper and less breathy than your head voice. In order to practice chest voice singing, try talking first and then transition into singing.For example, try repeating the words uh-oh while singing a variety of different notes.
You can also place your hand on your chest while singing in order to feel the vibrations. This will help you determine when you are singing from the chest.

, Some bass singers will develop a vocal wobble. This is a result of singing wide open and not rounding the vowels. In order to prevent vocal wobbles, you should practice creating rounded vowels. Keep your mouth round while singing a variety of different vowels.For example, sing the word ""more"" while completing a scale of notes. You can also try singing ""me"" while keeping a rounded mouth., When you are learning to sing bass, it is important that you listen to other bass singers. This will help you develop an ear for bass vocals and can help to inspire your own voice. For example, try listening to Barry White or Isaac Hayes."
"
Keep your knees and hips relaxed.,
Keep your chin parallel to the floor.,
Practice breathing exercises.,
Take small breaths while singing.",How to Learn to Sing Bass3," When you are singing bass your knees and hips should be neither locked nor bent. Instead, they should be loose and relaxed. Your pelvis should be positioned over your feet. This positioning will help to optimize your vocal abilities., You also want to make sure that your head is in the right position for singing. Your chin should be parallel to the floor and your ears should be directly over your shoulders. Many people have a tendency to hold their head too far forward. This can create pressure in your throat that will impact the quality of your voice.In most cases improper head positioning is a result of an overly arched back.

, In order to sing bass, you need to learn how to breathe properly from your diaphragm. Try lying on your back and resting your hands on your waist with your fingers pointing towards your belly button. Then, fill up your stomach with air by taking a slow and deep breath. You should be able to feel your hands rise and fall with each deep breath.Breath in and then exhale while counting to five. Do this ten times, making sure that your hands rise and fall with each breath.
Repeat the exercise twice daily.

, One common problem for bass singers is over breathing. By taking too much air a singer is forced to use their tongue to cap their breath causing pressure. Instead, you should take small breaths while singing and release the breath slowly."
"
Breathe in normally.,
Now you know what happens when you inhale you can start to correct it for singing.

,
The first point is that your shoulders should not rise.,
When breathing in for singing the ribcage should move up only a minimal amount but should move out as far as possible.,
The best way to understand this is to place your hands on the ribs of a singer (always ask first) as they breathe in.,
The diaphragm can now be used to sustain and push notes.

,
Practice makes perfect!,
Practice singing with your mouth wide open.",How to Increase Your Lung Capacity for Singing," When people breathe in the ribcage pulls the lungs upward and outwards. This causes the shoulders to rise and the diaphragm to contract and flatten.;
,, Instead your stomach should enlarge as you inhale. Don't be afraid of looking bloated as anyone singing properly won't look stick thin.

, This will begin to increase your lung capacity. The more you sing the longer you will be able to sing using one breath, and sustained notes will become easier and longer.

, This should show you how the system is changed.

,, Now you know what to do repeat until you no longer have to think about it!

, Pronounce each word clearly.

"
"
Drink while you smoke.,
Take smaller drags.,
Exercise.,
Smoke the lightest cigarettes you can.,
Smoke less.,
Quit.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice as a Cigarette Smoker," Before and after each drag, take a sip. This will keep your throat cool, and will keep some tar from sticking to it. Ideally, your drink should be non-alcoholic and non-carbonated, preferably water or juice.;
, If you take smaller drags, and hold them in for less time, you will not irritate your throat and lungs as much. Try to leave several seconds or more in between drags, to let your throat and lungs cool down.

, Try to get some aerobic exercise every day, preferably before you sing. 15 minutes is okay, but 30 or more is much better. It is essential that you exercise hard enough that you are breathing hard. The longer you breath hard, the better you will sing later (within reason).

, At first, you may not like smoking lights, but the improvements you notice in your voice will motivate you to stick with it. After you've been smoking them for several days, they will taste about like normal cigarettes.

, If you have a smoke every hour, try waiting two or three hours, and sing a song before each cigarette. You'll start to notice that the longer you wait, the better you sing. You'll also notice that you enjoy your cigarettes more this way. You can use this to motivate you to wait longer and longer.

, If all else fails and your voice hasn't improved to your satisfaction or you can't break your habits, you might want to consider taking it to the extreme and quitting altogether! You may have to choose between quitting smoking or quitting singing in the end.

"
"
Warm up sufficiently before you start singing.,
Slide up to reach higher notes.,
Slide down to reach lower notes.,
When you are about to sing a note out of your range, take in a deep breath and let it all out at once while you are singing the note.,
If you have a naturally soft voice, try singing bolder to reach that note.

,
If you have a naturally bold voice, try singing softer to reach that note.

,
When you are going to sing a low note, do not ever put your head down lower to sing it!,
When you are singing a note that is high, raise your eyebrows and open your mouth as wide as possible.

,
Smiling makes your voice sound higher.

,
Do scales every day to get your voice used to singing out of your range.

,
Never push too much!,
Breathe from your diaphragm.",How to Improve Your Singing Range," To find warm-ups for singing, consult a local choir director or find a video on YouTube.;
, Using a piano, begin on a note a fifth lower than a note at the top of your comfortable singing range. Slide your voice up a fifth and back down to your starting note. Move up a half step each time until you absolutely cannot sing the note at the top. If singing a certain note hurts, STOP. The last thing you want to do is hurt your voice. It is okay if your voice cracks, these should be notes you're not yet comfortable singing. After a couple of days doing this exercise, you should find that you can sing some higher notes than before.

, Repeat the same exercise, but sliding downward and each time going progressively lower.

, E.g. (breathe in) la (breathe out).

,,, It makes it harder for the air to come out.

,,,, It will damage your singing voice forever!

, This is a muscle near your stomach that helps you to sing. Place your hands on your lower back. When you breathe in to sing, you should feel your hands move back. A huge part of singing is breath control, and if you can properly control your breathing, it will be that much easier to sing notes you aren't yet comfortable with.

"
"
Avoid damaging your vocal chords by using the diaphragm to control your breathing.,
Don't use your throat, as you may strain it.,
Make sure you are relaxed when you are singing.,
Keep tension out of your face.,
Make sure you enunciate your each and every word when you are singing.,
Do not go overboard enunciating for a better and clearer sound.",How to Improve Your Singing Technique," According to traditional thinking, this breathing method should be used for both speaking and singing. However, modern vocal science says that by singing glottally with closed true vocal folds, you can let air out in minimal amounts, which reduces friction caused by air. This helps to spread the impact of vibration, preventing the development of nodules on the edges of your vocal folds.


To close the vocal folds, breathe in deeply, hold your breath and feel the set of muscles closing as you do so. These are the true vocal folds.
While you sing, focus on the true vocal folds and let out about a quarter of the air you just breathed in. This technique will prevent you from building air pressure beneath the vocal cords.
The sound should be clean, clear and more resonant than usual because you have eliminated the breathiness which can cause a muddy, unclear sound.;
, However, the voice is the place where sound is produced. According to classical training, your voice should come from your mouth and teeth. Classical singing technique was based on muscle memory and feeling, and less on science.


When singing with retraction, your mouth becomes a tool for good resonance and phonation, hence why they say that your mouth and teeth are where the voice comes from. To create good resonance, open the false vocal cords and add moderate twang. to open the false vocal cords, think of yawning; they naturally open. Keep your true vocal cords closed though.
To add moderate twang, make the obnoxious, sneering sound that children make when play practical jokes. It's a horrible sound, but if you only slightly narrow the muscles that are used to create that sound, you get moderate twang.

This helps with phonation because the sound is projected upwards through a small space, focusing it, and is then resonated in your mouth, which naturally opens to a nice 'C' shaped when your false vocal cords are open.



, If you are tense, it will show in your voice. This is a performance truth that is agreed upon by modern Estill, Musical theatre, Jazz, Classical and all genres, schools of thought and training programs. Do not tense your muscles, keep a straight back, but do not let it be stiff. This is called 'anchoring'.

, It is not good for you performance wise; the audience will be able to see your nerves.

, This can be achieved if you slightly elongate and emphasize your vowels. This doesn't seem like much, but it makes a huge difference. Make sure you don't miss ""t's"" and ""d's"" at the end of words. For example, in the word ""light"", many will say it like ""ligh"" if they're in a hurry, but it should be sung like ""laight"" with the double ""t"" because it's so easy to miss.

, You don't want to miss a breath or start of a bar just to enunciate words. The tempo always comes before enunciation.

"
Love the songs you sing.,
Smile as much as you can.,
Move around!,
Steal moves from the big guys.,
Learn to use facial expressions and poses to go with the emotions.,
Learn when NOT to grab attention.,
Talk to your audience.,
If you play an instrument too (while singing), such as guitar or bass, and cannot move that much, use facial expressions or your arms and hands the most you can to make the crowd follow you and have a good vibe.",How to Improve Stage Presence As a Lead Singer," It's common sense, but if you do not have your heart and soul in a song you will come off as fake and/or cheesy. Even if it's a cover, try to relate to the lyrics and the feeling as much as possible.;
, Even the most ""emo"" acts need to look like they're having a good time, because moodiness does not come over well to the audience. Let them see you are having a great time, and the effect will rub off on them. This doesn't mean you can't change up the feel for different songs, it just means you shouldn't look serious the whole time you are performing.

, Come on, don't just stand there looking awkward! If you constantly move, even just a little bit, your motion will attract the audience's eyes. Good examples of singers who moved around a lot include Axl Rose, Freddie Mercury, Morrissey, David Lee Roth, Bruce Dickinson, Michael Jackson, Bono,, Hayley Williams, and Robert Plant. Look up some of your favorite artists on Youtube to see what they do on stage, and go onto the next step.

, Go ahead, no one is going to fault you if you take some pointers from well-known singers. Axl Rose was renowned for his stage presence, by fans and critics alike. Don't copy one person, and don't copy their whole routine. Take the bits that you enjoy the most and make them your own. Eventually, after seeing how comfortable they are doing ""crazy"" stuff on stage, you'll feel more comfortable in your body doing your own stage moves.

, Be careful not to tighten your throat or do other actions that would inhibit good vocal technique! Watch Geoff Tate for someone who correctly vocalizes while dramatically expressing emotions.

, Sometimes you have to let other band members steal some spotlight. Otherwise you'll become an egomaniac in others' eyes! Think of David Lee Roth! Although it's great to be a bit showy now and then, vocalists need to back off a bit.

, If you involve the audience, they will be forced to pay attention. Freddie Mercury used to sing a line, then make the audience sing it back. Get the audience in on the songs. Ask them non-cliché questions, (Not, ""How're we doing tonight?!), make them shout out, tell them you want to see a mosh pit and things like that, depending on your style of music.

, A good ""Come On!"" followed by gestures will get the crowd going. Good examples: James Hetfield (Metallica), Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day), Geddy Lee (Rush), Matt Bellamy (Muse). Or if you play drums and sing, a good example is Aaron Gillespie (Underoath).

Practice “hiss” breathing.,
Maintain good posture as you sing.,
Keep your mouth open as you sing.,
Open the front area of your face.,
Keep the back of your mouth open.,
Make sure your larynx remains steady as you sing.,
Try to open your jaw more when you sing.,
Tip your chin down when you sing.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice1," Before you go to sleep and right when you wake up, take five minutes to do “hiss” breathing. This exercise will help you better control how much air you are inhaling into your diaphragm, instead of into your lungs. In singing, its very important to control the inhales and exhales from your diaphragm to get the most power and tone in your voice.Place your hands on your diaphragm, or just underneath your ribs. Inhale as much air as you can into your diaphragm.
Slowly exhale, making a “hiss” sound. Exhale as slowly as you can.
Count how long it takes you to exhale. Maybe on your first try, it takes you seven counts to exhale. Once you do this exercise on a consistent basis, you may be able to exhale for more counts.;
, If you slouch or are too rigid when you stand, your diaphragm can lock. This will close off your breathing.To get a better sense of correct posture and breathing, start by lying on the floor. Place a book on your abdomen. Breathe in and out. Notice if the book rises and falls as you inhale and exhale.
From lying down, you can move to your hands and knees. As you breathe in this position, notice if your abdomen rises and falls as you inhale and exhale. Your chest should stay steady and not collapse.
Once you feel comfortable with breathing in your abdomen or diaphragm, try to breathe in a standing position.

, This seems like a no-brainer, but many singers do not open their mouths open as wide as they should. Less space in your mouth means less sound coming out of your mouth, and less resonance to your voice.Test this with the two finger rule. Try to fit two fingers between your teeth while singing, especially when singing open vowels like “ah” and “oh”. If you can fit two fingers between your teeth, you are opening your mouth correctly. If you can’t fit two fingers, open your mouth wider.

, Singing from the front area of your face, just under your eyes and around your nose, can create a fuller, richer resonance to your voice.Say the word “hung”, drawing out the “ng”. Notice how the back of your throat feels closed and the sound comes out of the frontal area of your face, including your nose.
Say the word “hung” again, drawing out the “ng”. This time, move your tongue down towards the bottom of your mouth. Sing “hung”, drawing out the “ng” so it sounds like “hungahhh”. Now, you are accessing the front area of your face as you sing.

, This is equally as important as keeping the front of your mouth open. If the back of your mouth is closed off, the quality of your voice will be off.


Hold the “ng” sound in “hung”. Note how closed off the back of your mouth feels.
Say “ah” like you’re in the doctor’s office. Note how open the back of your mouth feels.
Try to leave the back of your mouth open like the “ah” sound to create a beautiful resonance in your voice.

, Your larynx is where your Adam’s apple is on your neck (or where it would be for ladies). Notice if this area of your neck is rising or falling while singing. If so, you are throwing off your voice and letting your larynx get in the way of your vocal tone.


A raised larynx can also cause your voice to crack.
Rest your hand on your larynx while singing to make sure it stays steady.

, This is a great trick to improving your singing voice.Stand in front of a mirror. Say A-E-I-O-U. Notice if your jaw closed on any of the vowels.
Chances are your jaw closed on the E and the U, as well as other vowels.
Take your two fingers and pull your jaw down 2 inches. You can also use a plastic bottle cap or wine cork to prop your jaw open.
Say the vowels again. And again. Now, sing the vowels on one pitch: A-E-I-O-U. You want to keep your jaw open (long, not wide) so it doesn’t close for any of the vowels. Keep singing the vowels until you can keep your jaw open.
Try to sing a phrase or line from a song. Make sure your jaw opens to the same position on all the vowels. Practice this until it becomes natural.
Your voice should sound louder and more resonant, with less strain.

, This simple technique will help you get more power in your voice without straining it.Stand in front of a mirror. Keep your chin pointed slightly down and your pectorals (or chest area) flexed.
Sing an “ah” scale up and down (1-2-3-4-3-2-1). Press your chin in, towards the floor.
Don’t let your head bob around as you go up and down the scale. Your chin may want to raise up when you get to the higher pitch but keep it down.
This adjustment should give you more power and control over your vocals.

Warm up your voice before every practice.,
Release your jaw.,
Do lip trills.,
Do tongue trills.,
Practice two octave scales.,
Practice the kazoo buzz.,
Do humming exercises.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice2," This will help to protect your voice and to improve your vocal range.The length of your warm up routine depends on the type of singing you are practicing. A classical singer who uses the higher octaves of their voice may need more warm up time than a singer of a contemporary genre who is only using a limited vocal range. As well, a belter may need more warm up time than someone who sings soft, gentle children’s songs.
The time of day you are singing may also affect your warm up time. Many singers need more time to warm up in the mornings because their voice has not been used for many hours (during sleep). If you have seasonal allergies, you may need to have a longer warm up to remove any excess mucus in your throat and lungs.

, This exercise will help to reduce any tension in your mouth or jaw. Loosening up your jaw will also help to loosening up your voice.Place the heels of your hands directly below your cheekbones.
Push in and down from the cheeks to your jaw line, massaging your facial muscles.
Allow your jaw to open as you move your hands down your face.
Repeat this several times.

, Lip trills are an exercise where you blow air through your pursed lips, letting out a sound on any given pitch. You can do any scales, intervals, melody patterns, or even whole songs on the lip trill.


To do a lip trill, you need to have an even flow of air, very relaxed lips, and control of your breathing. The air pressure must be constant but not too high.Begin by trying to make an “h” sound during a lip trill. Then, try a “b” sound.
If you can’t get your lips to buzz, lift them slightly with your fingers. Think of holding the vowel U inside your mouth to keep your larynx relaxed. But don’t push or strain your vocal chords.

, This exercise will relax your tongue and engage your breathing and your voice.Place your tongue behind your upper teeth.
Exhale and trill your tongue with an “r” sound. Hold the sound steady and keep your breath connected.
Try to vary your pitch up and down the scale while trilling. Avoid straining or pushing your voice beyond what is comfortable for you.

, This exercise will allow your vocal folds to stretch and expand.


Start in a low pitch and glide up the scale, making a “me” sound. Don’t push the top or bottom of your range. Instead, try to increase the range every time you do the scales.Reverse and glide down the scale from top to bottom, making an “e” sound.
Try to do this exercise on an “oo” sound.

, This exercise will improve the sound of your voice and stretch your vocal folds.Pretend you are sucking spaghetti as you inhale. On the exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound like a buzz.
Hold the buzz steady. Repeat the sound 2-3 times.
Use the “woo” sound to go up and down the scales.

, Humming is a great way to warm up your voice. It highlights the frontal vibrations in your lips, teeth, and face. Humming is also a good way to cool down your voice at the end of a warm up.Begin with your lips closed and your jaw loose. Breath in and exhale while saying “hum”.
Make a nasal sound with “hum” and glide down from a high to a low pitch, as if you are sighing.
You should feel tickling vibrations in your lips and nose as you hum.

Prevent getting a cold with a healthy diet and lots of rest.,
Maintain a daily cardio routine.,
Stay hydrated.,
Avoid smoking.,
Adjust your technique if you feel any discomfort or pain when you sing.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice3," A singer needs to take good care of his or her voice by also taking care of the entire body. Eat a balanced diet and get enough sleep every night to boost your immune system.Don’t let health issues or sickness affect your voice.

, This will help to increase your lung capacity and stamina. Having good lung capacity will help you during performances, especially if you are moving around on stage or dancing while singing.

, Drink room temperature water throughout the day. Avoid cold water as it can have a numbing effect on your throat and make it more difficult to use your vocal chords.

, Cigarette smoke can dry out your lungs and vocal folds. This will make breathing during singing more difficult and lessen your vocal quality.You should also avoid dairy products. They can create mucus in your throat that can muffle your voice.
If possible, avoid taking medications that have a drying effect on your throat or that might irritate your throat.

, Pain is almost always a sign of an unhealthy singing technique. The old adage “no pain, no gain” does not apply to singing.Pain and discomfort can be anything from hoarseness, unsteadiness, an inability to sing at a softer volume, and a voice that cuts out. If you feel pain or experience any of these symptoms, rest your voice, and consult a throat specialist.
Once your voice has recovered, adjust your vocal techniques so you do not damage your voice again.

Research vocal coaches in your area.,
Discuss your goals and expectations with the vocal coach.,
Be prepared to sing badly before you sing well.",How to Improve Your Singing Voice4," Look up vocal coaches in your area online. Watch their example videos to get a sense of their teaching style and their demeanor as a coach.Keep in mind, a good singer does not always make a good vocal coach. A good vocal coach should be able to explain singing concepts well and be willing to guide your through even the most basic singing techniques.
Another good way to find a quality vocal coach is to ask any friends, colleagues, or peers who are strong singers to recommend a vocal coach they have used themselves or heard good things about., If possible, meet the teacher in person first before you hire them. Ask them several questions to ensure you will be comfortable taking lessons from them:What is your teaching methodology, and how are lessons conducted?
What is the strength in my singing voice, and how would I use it and build on it?
What is the weakness in my singing voice, and how would you guide me to correct or improve on it?
If the vocal coach cannot answer these three questions, they may not have enough experience to help you or they have not thought deeply enough about how to conduct singing lessons.

, This applies not only to working with a vocal coach but with working on your singing in general. Singing, even badly at first, will help you identify the flaws in your voice and improve your technique. A good vocal coach will be supportive of your learning, even if you start off with a rocky or rough singing voice."

Learn about the history of ska.,
Learn about the big ska names, both old and new- Did you know Bob Marley was ska?,
Learn What Makes Ska..Ska- Ska is characterized by: The strumming rhythm of the guitar, the walking bassline and horns.,
Put it all together, learn some songs first, learn some good bands and write your music.,
Give it a name.",How to Write a Ska Song," Go on the Internet and learn about where ska came from, it shouldn't be too hard. There are a lot of different stories, but somewhere along the way, Jamaicans picked up jazz radio broadcasts from New Orleans. They liked the music and when they fused it with calypso and Caribbean mento, ska was born. (And consequently reggae came after that, but that's a whole different story);
, He started out his career in a ska band called Bob Marley and The Wailers, before they gradually switched to the slower, more relaxed version of ska which was reggae.


Ska is characterized into three waves. The first wave were the original Jamaican bands in the 1950s. The second wave is the wave that came into America...Big name bands like The Specials, The Toasters and Madness were pioneers of 2nd Wave ska, which started in England, but gradually came over to the U.S.
The genre was called Two Tone Ska because at that point in time, most ska bands were signed to Two Tone record label. In America, when ska seemed to have died, the Third Wave was born. This wave consists of the most widely known ska bands, for their appearances in movies and commercials and what not. With Third Wave ska came Ska Punk, which combined two tone with punk. Associated with ska punk is ska core...(Now some people may argue that they're the same but in my opinion, ska core is a little heavier.)
Some great ska punk and ska core bands are: Reel Big Fish, Operation Ivy, Sublime, Saving Ferris, Mustard Plug, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Big D and the Kids Table, Skankin Pickle, Catch 22, Streetlight Manifesto, and the pioneers and inventors of the ska core genre, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

, This is something that is totally constant no matter what sub genre of ska you may be working with. Here I will provide four links about ska guitar, ska bass, ska horns, and ska drums (Which isn't as important as the other three)


Guitar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99dj8j1xVM

Bass: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go_dl7Bj-E0

Horns: There was no ""How To"" video on this, BUT, here is a great video on 10 songs with GREAT horn riffs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUg5zUk-NIE

Drums: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuHq2yOZa8w This is a reggae beat, but nonetheless still good

, Now you want to write lyrics...Ska lyrics can be whatever you want, but they generally differ between what kind of ska you like...If your ska core, it wouldn't make sense to write a love song.


If your two tone like the toasters, you wouldn't write about fighting or being a skinhead. So apply lyrics to your specific style. Also, ska isn't always so serious. A lot of it is fun!! So just keep that in mind.
Have a rhythm that you can ""skank"" to. If you don't have a ""skankable"" song, its not ska.

, By now you've noticed ska band names aren't always so serious...Big D and the Kids Table, The Pietasters, The Toasters, Reel Big Fish...You get it. So just make it fun. Ska is the funnest and most laid back music genre there is, whether or not its two tone or ska core.

Learn how songs are composed.,
Be open to a simple melody.,
Use the minor third, if possible.,
Listen to your favorite sad songs.,
Do a free write.,
Make an outline.,
Consider connotation as you write.,
Try simile and metaphor.,
Pay attention to the musical arraignment in your favorite sad songs.,
Adjust your melody and lyrics.,
Sing your song and see if there's room for improvement.",How to Write a Sad Song," Lyrically, songs are made up of verses, choruses, and lyrics. Familiarize yourself with these different parts of a song. This will help you establish the basics and begin the songwriting process.


The verses of a song usually have the same melody but different lyrics. For example, in ""Eleanor Rigby"" the verses all follow the same melody, detailing the lives of various lonely people. If you listen closely, you'll notice all these stories follow the same melody and have roughly the same number of syllables.
The chorus is a part of a song that is repeated three or four times, each time using the same melody and lyrics. In Eleanor Rigby, the chorus is, ""Ah, look at all the lonely people."" A chorus is often used to sum up the theme or main point of a song.The bridge of a song has a different melody and lyrics than the verse or chorus. It provides a break from the usual progression of the song and the lyrics may reveal a hidden insight in the song. Not all songs have bridges, so including one is optional.Most songs follow this basic structure: verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. However, there are many variations. Using a basic structure at first, however, can help give you direction creatively. You can always make alterations to the basic structure as you write your song.;
, If you're a beginning songwriter, a simple melody is important. You do not need an elaborate melody to convey a sad feeling. A simple melody, using a few notes or chords, is the best option for a beginning songwriter.


To start, practice some popular that are also fairly simple. Use a guitar or piano to play songs like Tom Petty's ""Free Fallin'"" or Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here."" You'll notice that the melodies are not very complex and yet the songs still convey deep feeling.Experiment. Sit at the piano for a few hours or strum on your guitar. Play a variety of note and chord progressions, feeling around for the right sound. If you're a beginner, it might be best to stick to the 12 basic notes without incorporating flat or sharp notes into your song.Study chord progressions of a variety of sad songs. This may help you get a sense of how musicians compose. Look up the sheet music for your favorite sad songs online and try to play them at home.You do not have to have your melody completely established before you write your lyrics. Both your melody and lyrics will have to be tweaked accordingly as you move through the songwriting process. Just try to get a sense of the general length of your verses, choruses, and lyrics to help guide you as you compose your lyrics.

, When setting your song to music, you'll need to focus on music that conveys a sad feeling. A recent study shows songs written in a minor, the minor third especially, tend to better convey feelings of sadness. If you are writing a sad song, consider switching to minor third at certain points during the song to help your listeners experience sad emotions.However, listen to a variety of songs that incorporate minor third first. Switching dramatically to minor third may be jarring to listeners. Look up the sheet music for a few songs that use minor third and see how the songwriter's build up to introducing the minor third.
If you're a beginner at the piano or guitar, you may not know the minor third. That's okay. While it can help convey a sad feeling, you do not need to use it to write a sad song. The most important thing is to find a melody you're comfortable playing.

, If you want to write sad music, take some time to listen to your favorite sad songs. One of the best ways to find inspiration is to expose yourself to the work of other artists. This can also help you pay attention to things like melody and structure, providing you insight on how to write your own lyrics.


Make a list of your favorite sad songs. They could be break up songs, songs about death and dying, songs about sad events, and so on. Spend an hour or so listening to your sad songs. As you listen, pay attention to the music and lyrics. Ask yourself why the song makes you feel sad. What does the music do to convey a feeling of sadness? How does the speaker's voice sound? What is the pacing of the song like?
Try to break the song up into verses, choruses, and bridges. Identifying the different parts of a song's structure can help give you guidance as you write your own lyrics.
It can also help to read the lyrics. You can look up lyrics to most songs online. Read the lyrics as if they were poetry and try to analyze them. What is the song about? How does the speaker engage with the subject? Pay close attention to all the words the speaker uses and how they work to convey a feeling of sadness.

, A quick free write is a great way to start getting creative. Get out a pen and paper, go to a quiet space, and just write for about 10 minutes. Focus on things that make you sad. What upsets you? What makes you cry? What have been some of the saddest moments in your life? Why were these moments sad? How were you feeling during these times in your life? Try not to work too hard at censoring yourself. Just write down your thoughts as they come. Sometimes, the raw emotions you find when free writing can be used in songwriting later on., Before you begin composing your lyrics, make a brief outline. Decide how many verses you will have, whether you'll have a bridge, and how long your chorus will be. Then, write the barebones of what you'll be discussing in your song.


An outline does not need to use full sentences. You're just trying to convey the basics of what you'll be writing about, how many verses you'll need, and so on.
Jot down your title on the top of the page. Then, write ""Verse One"" and provide a sentence fragment about your first verse. For example, ""Verse One, about the sad feeling of change."" Then, inject your chorus if you're including one. For example, ""Chorus expressing sadness about moving away from Michigan."" Then, outline what you want to discuss in your second verse. Keep going until your song is fully outlined.
You can also take note of roughly how many syllables each verse should contain. This can help provide you structure as you begin composing your lyrics.

, When doing any kind of creative writing, you need to consider the connotation of the words you use. Connotation is a second meaning that is associated with a word alongside its literal meaning.For example, the word ""cold"" literally means low temperature. However, cold also carries connotations of closed off, mean spirited, and emotionally distance.


As you write your lyrics, pause after each line and evaluate the words. Pick out the most powerful, striking words in any given line and consider what these words could potentially mean for other people. If the connotations do not convey sadness, you might want to find other words.Say you're writing about a recent breakup. You have a line that says something like, ""When you left, I stood in the sun waiting for your return."" Sunshine is generally associated with happy memories. If you were left in the sun, the listener might conclude this person's absence had a positive effect on your life. What is a different way you could phrase this? What types of weather do people associate with sad emotions? Consider replacing ""sun"" with something like ""rain"" or ""cold."", Simile and metaphor are figures of speech used frequently in songs. Similes and metaphors compare two different subjects to show their similarities. A simile is a metaphor that uses ""like"" or ""as"" (""You lived your life like a candle in the wind"") while a metaphor simply states one thing is another (""Your love is a red dress."").First, get specific. What type of sadness are you trying to convey? Grief? Heartbreak? Loss? Regret?
Once you've picked the specific type of emotion you're going for, write down some images and ideas that could be associated with that image. For example, say you're trying to write about grief as your song discusses a lost loved one. Think of images that convey a sense of death, like a barren field, a light flickering out, a decaying plant, and so on. From there, make a metaphor or simile. Say something like, ""Your death was a rose stomped out in its prime.""
Songs do not always make metaphors explicit. Many songs use extended metaphors, using symbolic language throughout a song to talk about one thing when they're really getting at another. Regina Spektor has a song called ""Field Below"" in which she describes a barren landscape. Between Spektor's descriptions, there are lines like, ""But you don't live downtown no more, and everything must come and go."" This indicates the landscape is a metaphor for a personal loss., Return to the sad songs you were listening to while hunting for inspiration. Look up the sheet music that goes along with these songs and pay attention to what notes and chords the songwriters used.


Do these songs use a fast or slow tempo? How do you feel when you hear these songs? Why? How does the music push for feelings of sadness and pain?
It can also be helpful to look up the sheet music for these songs. Learn to play your favorite sad songs on a piano, guitar, or other instrument. This will help you get a sense of how to compose your own melody.

, After studying various sad songs, play around with your guitar, piano, or other instrument. Strum or play along as you mouth your lyrics, trying to find the right chords, keys, and tones to match the song. It might take some practice and dedication before you find something that works for you.


You may have to adjust your lyrics and melody as you go to get the song to work. For example, the melody may not have enough beats for all the lyrics to fit. You'll either have to shorten your lyrics or add to the melody a bit.
Remember, a melody does not have to complex, especially if you are a beginning songwriter. Try to keep the melody simple, using a few basic chords or notes throughout. As you write more songs, you can experiment with more complex music.

, Once you've written the musical accompaniment, sing your song. You might want to make a recording and play it back to yourself. Ask a friend or family member for feedback. Specifically, ask how your friend or family members feels when he or she hears the song. If the song is not coming off as sad, you may have to tweak some of the lyrics or melody a bit to better convey the feeling. It can take quite a few drafts before you get a song where you want it.

There are many different types of rock songs, and it would be extremely hard to cover all of them on one page.,
Get a pen or pencil and a piece of paper to record your ideas.,
Develop the main melody.,
Often melody starts with the same note as the ""ground note"" or root in the key chord, for example in D major it would be a d-note and in E minor an e-note.,
The two main components of a song are the verse and the chorus.,
Think of a chord progression that is a little different from the hook and (possibly) in a different key.,
Develop a background.,
You should now be able to write your solo.,
Put them all together.,
Organize a band.,
Get some good recording equipment and record the song.,
Show your song to your friends and family.,
You can now burn the song to a CD and release it to public, or write more songs and produce an album.

",How to Write a Rock Song," However, most rock songs all break down to 4 parts: The Hook, The Melody, the Bridge, and The Chorus. (but there are so many other kinds of ways to set a rock song, so don't worry about it). But before you begin to record the song, before you begin to develop the song, before you begin writing the song, before you even have an idea, you must have inspiration. You can't force inspiration, it comes to you in the right moment. Like, you have just broke up with your girlfriend, or you've just have been kicked out of your school, so don't waste your time, this is the best moment, write down the first thing that comes in your brain, now you've got the idea. The idea is the very first part of everything. So, how do you get the idea? First, start thinking about the message and the mood the song will carry out. This doesn't have to be very detailed or anything, just a basic idea.;
, Start thinking about the hook. The hook is a sort of a sub-melody, a riff, something you can easily hum, or the part of the song that gets stuck in your head. The hook generally sets the mood for everything else. Keep the hook simple as it is not the main melody of the song. After thinking about how the hook should sound, start to actually write it. Rock music is generally based on the major/minor/power chords of two sets of chords: I, bIII, IV, V, bVII (In the key of E the bar chords begin on the frets: 0,3,5,7 and 10) or I, bIII, IV, bVI and bVII ( these are 0,3,5,8 and 10). The first set will give you a more ""classic Rock"" sound whereas the second set sounds more modern. Mess around with the chords from one of the sets above until you get something that works.

, The main melody usually appears in the verses of the song. It is usually played in an Intro and then sang as the vocals throughout the song. However, it's too early for the lyrics yet, so just think up a general melody. One thing you can do is record the hook and just jam to it until you find a clear melody that sounds good and goes well with the hook.

, Then melody might lift up to third or fifth above, or drift to third or fifth below the note where it began from. (In key of D major, to f# or a and then down to B or G.) Usually a verse ends up returning to the same note as begun with or go one octave below.

, Each time the verse is played the words differ, whereas the words for the chorus stay the same throughout. Verse pretty much follows the hook and the main melody. But the chorus should be catchier and more memorable than the verse.

, Then write the melody. Another thing to keep in mind is the transition from verse to chorus. A good idea would be to add a bridge. A bridge is like a verse but the music is different and it is only played once.

, Add a bassline (base it roughly around the chords used by the guitar), drums, and any other instruments you think are necessary. They should go along with the theme and the hook. Also, add any backing vocals. It is a good idea to work through this step parallel to the previous ones.


Now, it's time for the lyrics. The lyrics should relate to the mood and the message of your song. They are the part that speaks to people. Lyrics in the verse should be more like telling a story. Lyrics in the chorus, on the other hand, outline the main theme(s) of the song. Some rock lyrics will have a statement, some will have a suggestion, some will tell the story and some will just be gibberish. The lyrics that write a great song are the lyrics that a crowd can sing along to.

, Solo is usually played on a guitar, however there are no limitations. Solo should be like the verse, chorus, or both, except instead of the lyrics the guitar (or another solo instrument) is playing the melody. Note, though, the solo instrument should not be playing the main, secondary, or any other melody used previously in the song. Good solo-writing technique is simply improvising. if you are a beginner solo-er, then a great rock solo would be playing the pentatonic scale.

, Most rock songs are organized in this manner: Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Chorus (repeated), Solo. Some songs have another part after the solo: The Outro. There also might be another verse somewhere inside the song. But as a beginner, you should stick to the general structure and then, as you gain more experience, develop your own. Get a piece of paper and write all of these down. Insert parts of the song in appropriate places.

, Start practicing the song. Then you might want to put ads somewhere to get some members. During the practicing time, you may make some final changes to the hook, melody, and any other part of the song. Then, you are ready to record.

, (Pawn shops or music stores usually have all you need.)

, You want to have other opinions other than your own. Then make necessary changes according to feedback you got.

Listen to the great rappers for inspiration.,
Get to know your beat well.,
Find a story or idea to hold the verse together.,
Determine how long your verse should be.",How to Write a Rap Verse1," Rap is, at its core, a form of poetry placed over a beat or instrumental track. Just like a burgeoning writer needs to study the great poets, a hopeful rapper needs to listen to the great rappers to learn from the best. It helps to read along with the lyrics as well to pick up on meaning. Listen to what you enjoy, but a small selection of verses to start with includes:


AZ's, first verse on ""Life's a B---"", on Nas's album Illmatic

Notorious B.I.G, ""Notorious Thugs.""
Black Thought, ""75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction), on The Root's Rising Down.

Rakim on ""As the Rhyme Goes On,"" on Paid in Full.

Kendrick Lamar, ""Backstreet Freestyle""
Lupe Fiasco, ""Murals""
Eminem, ""Lose Yourself"";
, If you are rapping over a pre-written beat, whether because you love the beat or because you were asked to collaborate with another musician, listen to the beat 4-5 times to get used to the rhythm. Get a feel for the speed and energy of the song as well as the mood.


Uptempo songs (Das Racist, ""People are Strange"") usually require fast verses with lots of words, while slower beats (50 Cent, ""P.I.M.P."") usually have laid back verses. This rule is not hard and fast, however (see Twista on ""Slow Jamz,"" for example).
Your verse should fit the mood of the song whenever possible. On A$AP Rocky's ""One Train"" for example, the beat is moody, dark, and cinematic. Accordingly, all 5 rappers with a verse talk about their struggle from poor, difficult neighborhoods to international superstar.

, While talented rappers can touch on many topics within just a few lines, all great verses have a central idea or theme that forms the backbone of the lines. Often, this idea is as simple as ""I am the best rapper alive,"" but many verses tell stories (2nd verse of Kanye West's ""Golddigger""), explore social issues (Killer Mike's verses on ""Reagan""), or simply muse on a question or theme (Mos Def using numbers on ""Mathematics"").


You do not need to stick completely to this backbone, but it will help you come up with ideas and keep your verse cohesive.
If you are supplying a verse to another artist, talk to them about the themes of the song.

, Most rap verses have 16 bars, which generally means you have 2 rhymes per bar (length of each verse Cruel Summer's ""The Morning"") If you are collaborating with someone, be sure to ask how many bars they want. At minimum, most rappers fit 2 rhyming lines in one line -- ""I treat the label like money from my shows / G.O.O.D. woulda been God except I added more Os"" is equal to one bar.


A bar is a measure of beats. Every time you count ""1, 2, 3 , 4,"" you've counted out 1 bar.

"
"
Begin by free-writing lines about your topic.,
Build a rhyme scheme around your favorite lines.,
Add metaphors, symbolism, internal rhyme, and poetic language to make your lines pop.,
Start with a powerful line or hook.,
Develop a flow, or rhythm, to your rap.,
Rewrite your verse to fit the beat.",How to Write a Rap Verse2," Using your topic as a launching point, start writing out lines of your thoughts, trying to rhyme the last words in each line. Once you've exhausted a set of rhymes, start another one and write lines until you run out of ideas. Explore ideas around your topic until you find the ones you enjoy or know best.


Don't worry just yet about making your lines perfect -- this first stage is used to create material to build your verse out of.

, A rhyme scheme is a pattern that give your verse structure -- think of it as a blueprint of which lines need to rhyme with which. If, for example, you rhyme the first two lines with the word ""me,"" then the next two lines rhyme with the word ""you,"" then you have rhyming couplets, or sets of two (couples). For the rest of the verse, you would usually use couplets in all of your rhymes (hear MF Doom's ""Beef Rap"").


Most rappers have mixed rhyme schemes, rhyming 2-3 lines together right before a longer string of 4-5 lines (Nas, ""NY State of Mind"").
Don't feel beholden or trapped by a rhyme scheme -- use it instead to help you build your verse.

, The best rappers know how to use poetic language and techniques that are centuries old, giving their words power and rhythm that many genres ignore. Some good ideas to start with include:



Alliteration/Assonance: Words with similar sounds that are placed close together, like ""Two tip-top teacher"" or ""apple attitudes."" Listen to Joey Bada$$'s ""Waves.""

Internal Rhyme: Rhyming words that do not come at the end of a line but in the middle of it. For example, Madvillain's ""Rhinestone Cowboy:"" ""Made of fine chrome alloy / find him on the grind he's a rhinestone cowboy""

Simile/Metaphor: Closely connected, this is when writers compare two objects that aren't usually alike to make a point or joke -- listen to any Lil' Wayne song to hear verses composed almost entirely out of similes and metaphors.

Refrain: A line that is repeated at various points for emphasis. For a master class in how to use a refrain, see Kendrick Lamar's ""The Blacker the Berry.""

Anaphora: When the first half of a line repeats, but the rest of the line changes, like in Eminem's ""If I Had"" where ever line begins with ""Tired of....""

, The first lines of your verse should introduce the verse and capture the listener's attention. Ask a question (Kendrick Lamar, ""The Blacker the Berry""), make an interesting metaphor (Tyler, the Creator, ""Yonkers"") , or blow the listener away with deft wordplay (Outkast ""The Way You Move"") -- anything to introduce yourself and make yourself stand out.

, Once you've got your words on the page, you need to figure out how to say them. Flow is how a rapper delivers his/her lyrics in along with the beat. Listen again to the beat you are rapping over and practice fitting your lyrics to it. Are their any words that deserve special emphasis? Should you sound angry and fast or calm and deliberate? Your goal is to sound natural, as if the lyrics were coming from your spontaneously.


Listen again to A$AP Rocky's ""One Train,"" where five unique rappers have verses over the same beat. Note how each one approaches the song differently: some urgent, some joyful, some angry, some contemplative.
If you know about poetic meter, a traditional rhythm for poetry, you can use these to help design your flow. Eminem famously used Shakespearean meter for his verses on ""Lose Yourself.""

, As you practice your flow, don't be afraid to go back and rewrite your verse so that it fits the beat better. If you are having trouble fitting all the words in, find a way to shorten your lines. Once you know what the chorus is, or what other rappers are talking about, you can adjust your lyrics to fit the song better, like Lupe Fiasco's verse ending on ""Touch the Sky:"" ""Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like ""

Determine what sort of riff you want to write.,
Listen to your favorite riffs for inspiration.,
Zone in on your sound.,
Start composing the riff mentally.,
Play around with the riff.,
Choose the right structure.,
Get technical.,
Refine your sound.,
Practice the riff.,

Make the riff part of a larger sound.",How to Write a Riff," Consider your musical goals and think about the kind of riff you aim to create. Are you in a melodic rock band, or would you rather craft a heavy, thrashing metal riff? Musical styles are diverse and often overlapping, so don't be afraid to get totally original.


A riff can be almost anything. Some of the most memorable rock and metal riffs of all time are simply repetitions of one bar, like ""Sweet Child of Mine"" by Guns 'n' Roses, or they can be elaborate runs that last for four or more bars, such as AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" or ""She-Wolf"" by Megadeth. You should feel no constraints when setting out to compose a rock guitar riff.;
, Sit down with some of your music and play through your favorite riffs and lines. Note what stands out to you about their rhythm, composition and sound. These will become the stylistic techniques you will use to start inventing your own riffs.


Listen to lots of different guitarists and study their approach to riff-writing. Bands like Black Sabbath that are known for the structural strength and catchiness of their riffs often employed simple methodologies, yet their writing styles distilled into a one-of-a-kind, instantly identifiable sound.

, It will help to have an idea what type of sound you're going for so that you can utilize the right tuning and playing methods once you actually start writing. Narrow down your desired sound to heavy or playful, uptempo or slow and grinding, melodious or chugging. It may also be worth thinking about how your idea for a riff might sound in a style you wouldn't ordinarily choose.


Rock and metal riffs for guitar are generally written using the Natural Minor or Harmonic Minor scale, although other scales can be used. Try to make something of a ""storyline"" out of the notes on the scale; just a simple little piece of music that you think sounds good (try playing through the scale a few times and see if inspiration strikes.)Classic metal tuning was often played in standard 'D' or 'E,' while heavier forms of music like death and sludge metal make use of a ""drop"" (lower) tuning., Begin laying the groundwork for the riff musically in your head. Hum your riff out loud or else play around on the guitar until you lock into something concrete. You'll work on the details later; this is your first opportunity to hear how the notes come together and can clue you in to what guitar tone might work best for playing the riff. Let your creativity flow and take the riff where it will. Make minor adjustments as you go and watch your riff take shape.Run through different scales and get a sense of how the notes sound. There are often very simple yet structurally-solid riffs just waiting to be picked out of basic scales—think of scales as a kind of ""database"" of raw sounds.
Humming along with your riff is one form of ""audiation,"" or mental listening, and can be an invaluable skill in helping you keep track of the music you're composing.

, Now that you've got a direction for your riff, grab your guitar and give it an initial trial run. Play around with the basic melody you've thought up to lay the foundation for the notes of the riff. Try to faithfully capture the sound you conceived of in your head. Hearing it played out loud will give you a better idea of what works about it and what doesn't.


If you find yourself stuck or your riff sounds lifeless, try adding stylistic embellishments, such as hammer-ons, palm-muting and pinch harmonics. These are invaluable and often-used tools of metal songwriting and can be useful in adding depth to an otherwise bland riff.You could also improvise a little, the way jazz musicians play freely based around a theme. Take your riff and play it four or five times, making slight departures from the chosen sequence of notes each time. You may end up with something more original that you like better.

, Tailor your riff to be measured in a particular number of bars (note: a bar is a segment of time that corresponds with a particular number of beats). Play through the bars at varying speeds or make slight alterations to the final bar of the riff to try out new rhythmic structures and give the riff a rounded sound.Most traditional rock-inspired riffs are played in a ""3+1"" bar structure, with one bar repeated three times and a minor variation on the last bar, for four bars total. Because of its universal application, the 3+1 bar structure could make a great starting place if you're having trouble coming up with anything., If you're familiar with writing tablature, put your riff down on paper. This way you can neatly see it laid out and arranged visually to begin committing it to memory. Make any necessary notes about tuning or progression that will enable the riff to evolve.If you don't know how to write tabs, it can be a priceless skill to learn. The basic principles of tablature are easy to pick up and become indispensable when you begin writing more complex pieces of music.

, Listen to how closely your riff matches up with your original idea for it. What sounds right, and what could work better? Music, like any art, is never a finished process. You shouldn't hesitate to continue making changes to your riff even after you've written tabs for it and sounded it out a few times.


Note how your riff's notes and chords come together musically. The riff you're writing should have its own natural rhythm and sound, so if something sounds off, this is the right time to hammer out the particulars of your chord progression, picking style, etc.

, It's now time to actually play your riff. Run through it over and over and get familiar with how it feels to play, trying to make every note and chord sound perfect. It can be very rewarding to hear music you've written played aloud.


Make the riff yours. Anybody can pick up a guitar and play; strive to create something with your special stamp on it, and practice it until nobody can play it like you.

, If you have the means, make an audio recording of the riff to preserve it and show off your work. The simplest way to make an audio recording is by using your smart phone's recording app (using your smart phone also gives you the option of taking a video so that you can spot any mistakes in your playing). For a more sophisticated touch, most computers and some amplifiers come equipped with basic audio recording software, and you can use this to archive your riff or even expand and add other layers to it to create a fleshed-out song.


Home recording typically only requires a basic microphone and a program like GarageBand or Fruity Loops, which are both free to download.Alternatively, if you have an old tape recorder lying around, you could record yourself the old fashioned way—the way your favorite players used to do.

, Envision the riff as part of a completed song, and think about how it works when played along with a band. If you happen to be part of a band, demo the riff for your bandmates and figure out how to incorporate it into your music. Take cues from the style you've created to formulate new riffs and begin developing your own unique style.Remember that the riff serves as a kind of ""theme"" for the song; it is not a song in itself. To take your songwriting abilities to the next level, start composing riffs for the bigger picture goal of fitting them to individual songs."

Do this for a while without setting pen to paper. When you're ready, make a list of every concept, unique perspective, or potential lyric that popped into your head. Allow these to guide and inspire the content of your song as you move forward.


Let your ideas brew for a while. Carry a notepad around with you so that if you get a flash of inspiration while you’re on a bus, working out, or buying groceries, you can capture the moment and hopefully expand on it.;
, If you were writing a term paper, you'd start with a thesis. But this is a rap song so start with a hook (a.k.a. chorus). The hook should not only capture the theme of the song, but, more importantly, be catchy and unique as well. A great hook will often inspire other elements of the song such as the beat or other lyrics, so don’t settle for something that doesn’t prompt any other ideas.


If you’re having trouble coming up with something out of the blue, riff off of or respond to a line you love from another rap song. Just don’t copy anything outright or you may find yourself in legal trouble. ""Drop it like it's hot"" was originally a throw-off line from a Hot Boys single in the early 2000s, but Snoop Dogg turned it into a huge hit several years later.

, Choose points from your brainstorm list that inspire you and flesh them out. Of course, this is where your skills as a lyricist and as a rhymer will show through. If you're an experienced rapper, play to your strengths. If metaphor is your game, let yourself move on the strength of your metaphors. If you're a natural storyteller, let a narrative emerge from the words.


Stay out of your own way. The biggest mistake you can make when you first get started writing lyrics is that you want to ""say"" something, and force abstract concepts into your lyrics. Be specific. Use concrete words, phrases, and images in your words to keep your idea in the background.

, While some people might take a ""I can rap about anything I want to!"" attitude, it's best to avoid rapping about your global cocaine trafficking empire if you're a teenager from the suburbs. Also, keep in mind that just because popular rappers write about certain things, it doesn't make your raps any more or less rap. The Beastie Boys rapped about partying and skateboarding in a talented, unique, and creative way, even though they didn't necessarily rap about traditional topics or fit into the traditional image of what a rapper should be.


If you really want to write a rap about something you don't do, make sure you make them as ridiculous as possible. Buff up the braggadocio; exaggerate to insane levels. Don't do it often, and not in serious songs, but have fun with it. Be creative.

, Unless you're a world-class rapper who makes magic every time straight off the dome, your first draft of a song won't necessarily be the best. That's okay. Bob Dylan's first draft of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" was 20 pages long and terrible. As you're writing, let everything that wants to come out come out, but then you'll need to scale it back to a workable and efficient set of lyrics.


Focus on the most memorable lines and images, and cut out everything that doesn't match that theme, that tone, or that story. If you're having trouble figuring out what works and what doesn't, try to rewrite the song from memory, without looking at it. This will act as a kind of strainer--you won't be able to remember the less effective bits, and you'll have to fill in stronger material for what you can't remember.
The average song will have 2-3 verses of 16-20 bars each, and 3-4 chorus sections of a variable number of lines. Try to aim for trimming down your output to that amount.

, In almost all kinds of songwriting, the melody happens before the lyrics. Most of the time, rappers will similarly develop the beat and become familiar with the music before attempting to write any lyrics. While a rapper might have a stockpile of rhymes built up in notebooks to jump off from, crafting a song requires a beat to rhyme to. Doing this will ensure that the song feels unforced and the music matches the words.


Find a producer online who makes beats and listen to several of them until you find some you like. Commission particular sounds or styles from the producer to get an original track. If you like samurai samples and old-school comic book references like the Wu-Tang Clan, send the beatmaker some examples.
Even if you have a kind of idea forming for a kind of song or topic you'd like, try to come up with at least three possible beats before settling on one. Matching content, words, and music is a complicated process. Don't rush it.

, You can do this on your own computer or sound equipment, or even just by recording yourself beatboxing for inspiration.


Start by sampling the break from an R&B or soul song you really like. The Meters were a relatively obscure New Orleans funk band from the late 60s, who became famous after being heavily sampled as the tracks for great rap songs. Chop the beat using GarageBand or other free software on your computer.
Create beats with a programmable drum machine. The Roland TR-808 is the most iconic drum machine, used in many classic hip-hop and rap tracks. It features a wide variety of bass kicks, hi-hats, hand claps, and other percussive sounds that you can program in different patterns. You can also process and manipulate these beats on your computer.

, Add the melody using bass tones on a synth or keyboard, or by sampling a melodic line from a pre-existing song. Listen to the song repeatedly until the melody starts to reveal itself. Listen to it from different angles and come up with different melodic possibilities. This will help you to find the hook as you begin composing the lyrics and the chorus to the song.


Record a ""scratch track"" of yourself singing nonsense words on top of the beat to help find and remember the melody. It doesn't matter if you're a good singer, because this won't stay on the song. Just allow yourself to explore the beat and find a melody in it by free-singing, humming, or vocalizing.

, Some beats are upbeat and make you want to dance and may lead to party-rap songs, while some dark beats will lead to serious or political material. Just because a beat is good doesn't necessarily mean it's the right beat for the song you want to make. As you listen, imagine the possible songs that could come from each beat and pick one that matches your desires for the song.


You may not have any clue where the song is going as you listen, and that's ok. Go with your gut. If a beat ""speaks"" to you--it's time to start making music.

, Now that you have a good idea of the sound your completed song will have, arrange your rhyme into verses (16 bars apiece). You can start each verse with nearly any rhyme, but it's a good practice to end with a rhyme that makes a point.This way your verse doesn't seem to be left hanging. A popular song structure would be:


Intro
Verse
Chorus
Verse
Chorus
Verse
Middle 8 (a.k.a. breakdown)
Chorus
Outro

, Practice rapping your song on your chosen beat to work out the bugs and optimize your written verses. Cut out as many words as possible and then cut out some more. Remember, a rap song is not an English paper; only use the words that are needed to make your point, nothing more. Don't be afraid to add a pause or two, which can help to enhance a certain point in the song.

, Rap your lyrics over your beat until you have memorized every breath and you are sick of hearing them. Only then will you be ready to produce your song.

, Either hook up with a producer to get the recordings and mastering completed or self-produce the song.

Write a new riff for the chorus or verse, so you have two unique melodies.,
Consider coming up with one new section for the breakdown or solo.,
Follow the basic pop song structure when crafting songs.,
Play the song as fast as possible.,
Pick up influences from other bands and genres to make your songs stand out.",How to Write a Pop Punk Song1," Power chords are the backbone of every punk song ever written. They are short, easy to play, and sound great when played loud. A power chord is just three notes -- your index finger on the E or A string, and the next two strings fretted two frets down. You can move this form anywhere on the guitar to play every single chord. For example, an A, G, D, chord would look like:



A-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord |
|e|----x-----|------x------|-----x------|
|B|----x----|------x------|-----x------|
|G|----x----|------x------|-----7------|
|D|----7----|------5------|-----7------|
|A|----7----|------5------|-----5------|
|E|----5----|------3------|-----x------|;
, Bass players have a lot to look forward to in pop punk. If you're stuck or a newbie, quickly repeated 16th notes on the bass (basically playing one note over and over again) can follow the chords on the guitar to instantly fit in. For example, if the guitarist is playing an A-bar chord, you play the A note in time with each one of her chords. From here you can feel free to improvise during chord changes, before switching to the chorus or verse, or if you can think of a fun bass riff.


Check out Green Day's ""She,"" which opens with a great but simple bass riff, and note how it follows the guitar, but with subtle flourishes.
Rancid's ""Olympia, WA"" is almost straight 16th notes on the bass, carrying the song along.

, You want to keep the song moving forward with a quick, regular beat. Sixteenth notes on the hi-hat, alternating the kick drum and the snare every other note. While there is a lot more to drumming than this, this basic beat can go behind any pop punk song.


Big, quick fills on the toms and crash symbols are the common way to transition into new parts of the song.
Pop-punk drummers like Travis Barker are talented musicians who drive the song forward. Focus on keeping time perfectly, especially at high speeds, to become an invaluable drummer.

, 95% of pop punk songs are short, fast, and guitar-driven. Find 3-4 notes or power chords that you think sound good together and make up a short little phrase to repeat. Most pop-punk songs are simple -- find a riff you like and repeat it to write a verse or chorus.


Chop up and change your favorite riffs from other bands. Pop-punk is heavily borrowed, adapted, and repeated.
In general, three power chords are the bare minimum for a song.
Play with the rhythm and timing of your chords to give them a unique spin.

, To be honest, many bands play the exact same chords, just in a different order or tempo (listen to the Ramones for proof). In general, the verse is slower and or muted and the chorus gets louder, faster, and more melodic. When coming up with a chorus:


Keep it simple -- the chorus should not be hard to follow.
Aim for catchy melodies -- this is where you hook people's ears.
Add a short, improvised 1-2 bar riff coming in and out of the chorus to mark each change.

, After hearing the verse and chorus twice, most bands add in one quick, unique section to change the song up. This is called the breakdown, and there is often a solo, different lyrics, or a slow drop and build back to full energy or tempo. They are usually slower, either building up power or leaving room for another instrument to play by itself. If you're struggling to write breakdowns, try to:


Play the verse or chorus at half-time.
Replay or change up the intro riff or melody.
Simplify the chords to the 1-2 most important ones, leaving space for vocals or a solo.
Drop out certain instruments, then slowly build them back in.

, Most pop punk songs begin with an intro, and they usually then follow this order: Intro, first verse, second verse, chorus, third verse, chorus solo and/or bridge, and then finish with the chorus again or outro. Though some songs will be different, this is the most common structure of a Pop Punk song.


Blink-182's ""Dammit"" is an excellent example. All you have to write is a riff for the verse, the chorus, and the bridge. when it comes to solos, they are usually very simple. Occasionally it's just the intro again, and in some cases there are no solos at all

, Pop punk is not about sitting back quietly. It is about brash, loud, youthful energy. All pop-punk songs should be played as fast as you feel comfortable, and maybe even a little faster. Once you've got the structure down, start thrashing.


When you play live, your number one goal is to have high, contagious energy. Quick songs make it much easier to get people jumping around with you.
It is rare for songs to go longer than three minutes. Many are even over before the two minute mark.

, Pop-punk, luckily enough, is easily adapted to other influences and ideas. Keep playing music of all types to learn new riffs and styles. It is the best way to make your own song unique. Common genres to blend with pop punk include:


Ska and Reggae (Rancid, Operation Ivy, Less Than Jake.
Country (Social Distortion, Lucero)
Swing/Rockabilly (The Misfits, Cobra Skulls).

"
"
Come up with one image, idea, or person to write a song about.,
Focus on a simple, catchy chorus before anything else.,
Make verses short, matching the same length and rhyme scheme for each.,
Consider adding a refrain or sing-along section.,
Get personal.",How to Write a Pop Punk Song2," Pop-punk songs can be about almost anything. Most commonly, however, they talk about love, adolescence, and rebellion. Unlike its older cousin punk, pop-punk songs are focused more on melodies and relatable lyrics than hard-hitting social criticism. Common subjects include:


Love and heartbreak
Suburban angst
Rebellion against school, parents, etc.
Joke-y and goofy lyrics
Growing up., Pop music, no matter what subgenre, is about music that hooks the listener in. You want everyone singing or humming your chorus when the song is done. Keep it short, simple, and make sure it sounds great.


Whistling the lyrics is a great way to hear the melody. Write lyrics so that they sound great even when you're just whistling.
Green Day, Blink-182, Operation Ivy, and Rancid are great bands on their own, but it is their ability to write a catchy, radio-friendly chorus got them famous., The easiest way to write song lyrics is in rhyming couplets. Basically, you write one line, then write another line that rhymes with it. These lyrics need to flesh out your chorus and idea. If you're stuck with the verses, you might--


Tell a story (""Timebomb"")
Describe related moments or images about a girl, life, school (""Story of my Life."").
Explore a theme or idea, using each verse to talk about a different aspect (""Longview"").

, The sing-along, often little more than ""lalalas"" ""oooohhhs"" and ""ahhhhhhs,"" is a staple of pop-punk. Often used in the chorus or outro, a good sing-along section is key for a pop-punk section. You don't need one in every song, but even something as simple as ""nananana nanananana"" in ""All the Small Things"" is the difference between a good song and a hit.

, Pop punk is personal medium. Your own worries, fears, and anger will fit right at home in the lyrics, so don't shy away from personal stories or opinions. Punk is known as an inclusive, do-it-yourself genre, so just be yourself. Even somewhat angsty, emo-type lyrics work well, as evidenced by Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, and Screeching Weasel.


Feel free to get weird. The Lillingtons, for example, made their mark with sci-fi inspired songs.
Feel free to be funny. Pop-punk has a long history of pranksters and joke songs, from the poppier NOFX songs to the self-awareness of The Steinways."
"
Write about your love.,
Create metaphors.,
Embellish your narrative with similes.,
Find your image.,
Build a word list.,
Find some rhymes.,
Define the arc of your song.,
Think freely.,
Listen to what you recorded.,
Add harmony.,
Put it all together.",How to Write a Love Song," Before you turn your heart into poetry and music, you will want to express yourself without the constraints of meter and rhyme. To do this, describe the person you love, how they make you feel, and how it feels to be together.


You can describe their physical attributes, including how they look, how they move, how they love, how they dance—anything that describes them physically.
Also describe them emotionally. Are they strong, courageous, and forthright, or perhaps quiet and contemplative. Anything that describes who they are and their personality traits is good to write down.
Describe the ""us"" of your relationship. Talk about the things you do, or don't do. Talk about how you got together, and what your hopes are for the future. Even if you're not actually together with the object of your love, you can imagine what it would be like if you were together.;
, This is where your creativity will come in. Extend the story of your love by describing it in ways that are very much not literal. A metaphor, at it's most basic, is describing what something is by using something it is not.


For example, you may love her in part because she smells good, which is nice, but doesn't make for a winning line in a love song! Instead, you can write that she is a field of flowers on a warm, fragrant night.
Work through your narrative, adding as many metaphors as you can. Some may turn out to be elegant masterpieces, some might be as fragrant as the city dump. At this point, the goal is simply to explore what you can say about your love.

, Like metaphors, similes are ways of describing your love by using something symbolic. However, a simile suggests only that one thing is like another.


Again using your sweetheart's smell as an example, you could say she's like a field of flowers. However, without saying why she's like that, you leave the listener hanging: is she like a field of flowers because she's colorful, or smells good, or attracts men like bees to nectar? All are possibilities, so make sure you complete the description!

, Once you've filled in the narrative, and have a clearer idea of both the object of your desire, and how you are given to describe them, you can start to figure out how your song is going to work. To give your lyrics form, create an overall image space for the lyrics to fill.


Using the above example, you may decide to use the overall image of a garden. You already have the flowers in there. Perhaps you can use the roots, or the honeybees, or other garden parts to build your lyrics.

, To create new associations out of your narrative, use your image and a thesaurus to create a word list that you can draw from.


For example, from ""garden,"" you might list words like ""growth,"" or ""flower,"" ""tending,"" or maybe ""hothouse"" for a steamier image!

, Using the word list you create from your image, use a rhyming dictionary to find the best rhyming word or words for each image word you created. Some might be easier than others!


For example, words like ""flower"" lend themselves easily to rhymes: ""shower,"" ""bower,"" and ""power,"" while others are more of a challenge, like ""growth."" You can use this rhyming list to narrow down the words that will work by eliminating those that are either awkward, or won't work at all.

, Now that you have an idea how you're going to frame your ode to your love, sketch out what you want to say, and how you want to say it. A typical format for love songs is ""verse, verse, chorus, verse, chorus.""


Each verse says something new about the subject, and the chorus ties it all together. Sketch out what you want each section to say.
For example, verse 1 may talk about how you see your love; the second verse, how she makes you feel; and the third verse could describe how you envision the future.
The chorus can do a number of things: you could as the place to bring it all back to the garden where your love grows; or use it to lament how all these things come to nothing outside the garden of your imagination. It all can be drawn from the narrative you created!

, Before you actually commit words to melody, you have to come up with the basic idea for the melody. Many times as you are writing, this will happen spontaneously. If so, consider yourself fortunate! However, there will be times when the muse fails you, and you have to develop a melody.


Start by turning on your recording device. Whether it's as simple as a cassette deck, or as involved as a ProTools rig, the idea is the same: keep track of your ideas.
Using your lyrics as a metric aid, start humming melodies that occur to you. If you wish, you can use the actual words to help develop the melody, or you can do like artists such as Peter Gabriel do, and sing nonsense syllables just to get a sense of the melody.
Do this for about a half an hour, then let it rest. Take a break, walk the dog, watch your favorite TV show—it doesn't matter what, as long as you clear your head and ears of your song for about an hour.

, Sit down with pen and paper, and listen to your recording. You may find sections that thrill you, and some that put you right to sleep. Make note of the ones that move you, and use those to develop your melody.


As you develop your melodic ideas, transfer them to your guitar or piano to play. If you're like many, and don't have a trained voice, playing the melody on the piano or guitar will really help you focus the song.

, As you created your melody, it's likely you implied the harmonies that you will use. Sing through your song, working out the basic chord structure. This doesn't have to be involved or fancy—melodies can be reharmonized later, for added interest or even a different flavor.


It's equally valid to begin with a harmonic structure, and work out the melody based on the chords, rather than the other way around. In fact, you can even create the lyrics after you've created the musical backing. Some people find one approach easier than the others. If one way doesn't work for you, try the others instead.

, Once you have the words, the melody, and the harmony worked out, play it! Using your recording device, record a few variations of your song, then let it sit overnight. The next day, listen back to what you recorded, and pick the best parts of each variation, and use that to polish your song.


Repeat this process until you are satisfied with how your song sounds. When you are done, find your love, and sing your song!

Be persistent.",How to Write a Hit Song," If you plan on writing out your song by hand, you'll need a pencil, eraser, and staff paper. Digital production will require a suitable computer and a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), minimum.


When building or buying a computer, choose one with a 3.0 dual core processor (or better), at least 8 GB of RAM, and no less than 500 GB of hard drive space.Popular DAWs, which are excellent tools for home or independent production, include Ableton Live, Fruity Loops (FL) Studio, Steinberg Cubase Pro, and Apple Logic Pro.Feel free to use whatever writing utensil you desire for physical production. However, as the song develops, you'll likely have to make adjustments or changes, so pencil is recommended.

, Tap into universal themes and emotions so anyone can connect with your song. Heartache is a common topic in hit music, but there are many other options, like falling in love, the feeling of a perfect day, betrayal, loss, and hope.The theme of your song will guide you in the production of its lyrics and sound. These should align with the feelings and use words associated with your theme.

, Timeless lyrics will still be enjoyed even after a considerable time has passed. These kinds of lyrics also generally have a wide audience, which will improve your overall popularity with many different age groups.


If your lyrics aren't catchy, you'll never be recognized as a hit songwriter. Look for lyrical inspiration in poetry, art (like exhibits at museums), and the natural world.Some example of timeless hits from the 60s through the 70s include ""Paint it Black"" by The Rolling Stones, ""Brown Eyed Girl"" by Van Morrison, ""Go Your Own Way"" by Fleetwood Mac.
Timeless hits from the 80s through the 2000s include ""Don't Stop me Now"" by Queen, ""Don't Stop Believin' "" by Journey, ""Billy Jean"" by Michael Jackson, ""Smells like Teen Spirit,"" by Nirvana, and ""Mr. Brightside"" by the Killers., Alternatively, you can do this in your DAW if you've decided to produce your song digitally. By splitting your lyrics into syllables, you can be certain that each syllable gets a tone.


Generally, each syllable of the lyrics will be assigned a tone (also called a ""note""). In some situations, a single tone may be sustained for a few syllables or split into a run of tones, like sixteenth notes, for a single syllable.
Even when you plan on sustaining a single tone for many syllables or beats, breaking up the lyrics into syllables will help you keep track of the rhythm of the song.

, Tempo is a musical term that refers to the speed of the song. This is usually recorded in BPM (beats per minute). You can set the tempo with a metronome, though most DAWs come built in with this tempo keeping tool.Although a hit can be nearly any tempo, most use one that is between 117 to 122 BPM. You may want to use this trend in to your advantage when writing your hit song.
Do some research on the genre or kind of music you want to produce. Some kinds of songs have specific speed requirements, like the usual 90 BPM of ballads., The bassline is comprised of lower-tones and percussion, like drums and cymbals. This part of the song is generally simple and repetitive, but catchy. It should follow along with the pulse of your tempo.Although percussion instruments tend to dominate the bassline, low-tone single notes, chords, and runs of notes can be added in with other instruments. Try doing this with a piano, guitar, or baritone.
The bassline of your song should loop so that it plays through most of your song. This pattern may be adjusted at transitions, like where the verse switches to the chorus, solos, or at a musical bridge towards the end of the song., The melody is the main through-line of the song. When you hum along with the main part of a song, you're humming the melody. In most cases, the melody is made up of a single instrument, a single voice, or a single instrument paired with a voice.The melody of your song should complement and synchronize with the beat of the metronome and the bassline.
Instruments frequently used for the melody include the piano, guitar, brass (like the trumpet or trombone), organs, synth tones, and more.
Design your melody so it has contour. The natural rise and fall of tone throughout the melody, along with dynamic (volume) changes will make your melody more interesting to listeners., Be sparing when adding more instruments to your song. On average, most hit songs have no more than seven instruments (including voices).Too many instruments/voices can make your song distorted and unclear.


If you're a novice songwriter, you may want to keep the number of accompanying music instruments (including voices) added at this point to two or three to prevent oversaturation and muddiness.

Harmonize the accompanying instruments in chords. Use pleasing sounding arrangements of single-tone notes or runs of notes in the accompaniment., Although songs written in minor keys can be compelling, few rise to the top as hits.Chord structure that is too complicated can overwhelm listeners. Stick to simple, archetypal patterns that contribute to the atmosphere of the song.One common chord progression in hit songs is I – V – VIm – IV, as in: C – G – Am – F ; D – A – Bm – G ; A – E – F#m – D ; G – D – Em – C ; and E – B – C#m – A.
There are many different chords to choose from and unique ways of putting chords together. Experiment with these to find what works best with your song.

, When you reach the end of a build or powerful lyrics, increase or decrease the dynamics (volume) correspondingly. Use an extra instrument or two to emphasize these parts of your song. Use rests (pauses) to increase tension.Unusual sounds or samples can create an enjoyable surprise in your song. DJ Premier did this artfully by bringing out the drumline with a sample of birds chirping., Even though many trends in hit music have been analyzed, no composer or researcher has figured out how to write a hit every time. Strong feelings usually convey potent messages to listeners, so using your feelings as a guide for writing your hit can be helpful.Save drafts before making changes to your song. Some additions can make a song worse, in which case you might want to roll back the song to a previous version.

, Re-purpose themes, licks, and riffs from old music. Put your own spin on these and incorporate them into your own melody. Take inspiration from your favorite oldies or the classics. Revitalize forgotten hits of the past by creating your own song from them.Avoid copying a song note for note, word for word, or even too closely. Doing so could be interpreted as plagiarism and could result in legal trouble.Explore different avenues of inspiration. You may find that collaborating with another artist pushes you to make your best work.

, Trying to follow the rules too rigidly can stifle your creativity. It can also make your sound too stiff or lacking in fluidity. When brainstorming ideas for your song, be willing to try new things. You never know when an unexpected lyric or combination of sounds will occur to you.Because music can be fickle, you might want to keep a physical notebook for ideas or take musical memos on your phone for ideas that pop into your head.

, When mining for gold, it can take quite a while before finding the motherload. In the same way, even talented songwriters write many songs before they strike upon a hit.Train your song writing abilities by practicing writing songs as frequently as possible.

,How to Write a Hit Rock Song1,
"
Start a rock band.,
Cultivate a fresh, yet familiar sound.,
Let your band get famous.",How to Write a Hit Rock Song2," People don't like hit solo songs. They always want to hear a band they know rocking it out in overproduced style. This leads into the second point.

, In order for a song to be a big hit, it is not going to be the first of its kind. it will be coming out a band with a well-developed, mature style.

, There are other articles about how to do this. A song will not be popular unless the band playing the song already is well known. A hit song will not be possible at least until a band has a sizable, if not national, or even international fan-base. Now it's time for the song to be written. is it. Here are some things that will help ensure it is a hit:

"
"
Team up.,
Write lyrics: un-clarity is key.,
Write Music: it needs a good melody, and good rhythm.,
Arranging.,
Practice.,
Wait for the right time.,
Release it on a CD.,
Watch and wait.",How to Write a Hit Rock Song3," A song has more potential for popularity if it has multiple people working on it, probably another member of the band. This will help knock down bad ideas before the audience does, and will start the song out already having multiple fans. Also, band members will be more excited about playing the song if they had a part in its creation and were able to contribute their own unique musical inclinations.

, Focus not on a general message, but on a nebulous theme. Although it may sound ridiculous, many hit rock songs do not have clear messages or meanings to them. Think of five famous rock songs. At least one of them probably does not have a point or clear meaning. For three famous examples, Bohemian Rhapsody, Bold as Love, and Stairway to Heaven. All of these were hit songs, yet the message is very unclear, vague. This is an important part of writing the lyrics to the song, so that listeners may interpret the meaning to fit their own contexts. Letting listeners use their imagination and think while they listen is great. Use words that people like to hear, cool words eg.""Love"", ""Colors"", ""Heaven"", and ""Nothing really matters"", ""Dust in the Wind"", ""Ocean Waves"". Talk about someone you knew, talk about how you met them, and make it crazy. Talk about how it's going now. But make the whole thing up. If you are writing a hit song, you should know that most listeners will not focus on deep meanings but simply on words or phrases they can sing along too. Be different. People don't like to listen to the same recycled guitar riffs and drum sets, break the barrier, and make music worth listening!

, This doesn't mean the song needs to be fast or slow, but whatever it is, the rhythm needs to be immediately apparent to the listener. Ask any music buff, and they'll tell you that the 3rd verse is where a song changes. If you have 1verse-chorus-2verse-chorus, then people are going to expect something different, or they might change the song! Change it up a bit on the 3rd verse; maybe do a falsetto, or acapella, or a guitar solo, then go back to the familiar chorus. Make is easily recognizable, so when someones hears a friend singing it or it starts on the radio, they will say ""Oh! That's ! I love that song!"" Boom. Instant, free, advertising. Avoid excessive repeated notes in the melody line. Hit melodies often are sung higher than most people's ranges. The style of the song should be fitting with the band's general style. As far as chord progressions go, you don't need to be creative. Most hit songs do not use creative chord progressions. Two very popular chord relations are I IV V IV and I V VI IV. There is nothing wrong with using these progressions; just make sure you are writing your own song and not copying someone else.

, This is a very important part of the make up of a song, but often overlooked by eager song writers, who might want to play the song without backup. Make sure there is a clear solo instrument that listeners will recognize, such as electric guitar or piano, or even something like whistling or a tribal flute. There should be backup which is always present, but never overpowering. Drums, bass, keyboard, and guitars should all come in at some points in the song, but should never be confused with the solo instrument. If there is too much going on, or multiple instruments soloing, this will confuse and distract listeners, who don't really want to think about the music. Diversify with dynamics, tempos, rhythmic flavors, and reprises. Keep the chorus or tag of the song somewhat consistent throughout.

, Now that the song is written and arranged, it must be practiced to consistency and perfection before it can be introduced. Try out different things, and make sure the band enjoys playing the song. Allow sufficient time for the song to mature.

, In spite of your excitement about your up-and-coming hit song, the time might not yet be right. Maybe the world isn’t ready for genius, or won’t recognize it. Talk with the band’s producer/manager about strategies for making the song come in with a bang. Plan a strategic time during a big home concert to introduce it, and be sensitive to the audience.

, Hand the CD out free at grocery stores, football games, anywhere. Or maybe charge $2.50 so people think your more official than some band that hands out free CDs. Get radio deals. Songs do not become famous by accident. Fame is a result of lots of hard work. Make deals with a label. Make sure fans have access to it. Put it on a Myspace music site, use sites like ] TuneCore to put it on places like iTunes, hand out CDs of your band at Halloween instead of candy, pass out CDs at school, a great thing to do would be to talk to your principal to let your band play at a sporting event like a football game, or at a school assembly. That would be great exposure!

, It won’t become a hit overnight. Be persistent, and if your song doesn’t turn out to be a hit, better luck next time. Record videos of your band performing, and just hanging out and partying. Then release it as a podcast on iTunes or other podcasting services, and tell people about it!

, For example, the subject of the song might be falling in love, the message might be that there is someone for everyone, and the story might tell of a man and a woman who meet and fall madly in love.

, The chorus is a bridge or connection from one verse to the next. It must make sense to sing the words of the chorus in between all of the verses. From the chorus, you will also need to make up a catchy title for your song.

, This verse should draw attention to your song and make your audience want to listen. Don't worry about it being perfect at this point, you will refine all of the verses and the chorus later.

, In this part you will need to continue to tell the story and explain what the action is. Don't be too detailed, this is a three-minute song, not an opera.

, Tell more about your story here, and add relevant information. You really want to advance the storyline from verses one and two, because the next verse will close the song.

, The aim is to bring it all together like the last chapter of a book.

, After you have lines, you will need to go back and change the ending words so they will rhyme. Do this with the chorus too. Every lyric should be of similar length so the song will glide along and not be choppy.

, If composing is not your thing, you could work with someone who can compose and complete your song.

Come up with a title for your song.",How to Write a Pop Song," The goal of a song is to express an idea. This could be very simplistic or complicated, but it has to come from somewhere, and mean something to you. Some of the best places people seek inspiration are at coffee shops, where lovers and/or friends meet up, talk, kiss, and interact. Other songwriters like going out into the woods where they can hear the birds chirping, and experience the awesome solemnity of nature.Look for a place which suits your needs. If you need interaction, go to a crowded place. If you need silence, take a drive or sit by the lake.
Spend some time using all of your sensory abilities. Look to see the colors around you, listen to the sounds you hear, feel the table in front of you, and smell the multitude of aromas.
The ideas you come up with don't necessarily have to be serious or intricate. Especially when it comes to pop songs, short, sweet, and upbeat thoughts are especially welcome.;
, Grab a sheet of paper and a pencil/pen when you go to seek your inspiration. Every time you hear, touch, smell, or see something interesting, write a word or two down which represents it. For example, I hear a bird calling in the woods so I write down ""feather, echo, call, hear me."" Compile a large list of these as you travel to different locations and seek inspiration from elsewhere.Carry a small 2X4 inch journal in your pocket when you travel. This way you will have a way to keep your ideas contained together, and always have something to write an idea down on.
Put stars around, or underline words which weigh on you heavily. These might be words you want to focus on when you later write your song.

, You do not want to write a song about love, death, depression, working, dreams, and learning who you are. One of those works just fine, and will help to focus the minds of your listeners later on. Take your random word lists, and begin to cross certain words off. Begin a permanent list on another piece of paper.Each of these important words should center on one topic. For example, ""gravel, breeze, going home, rough road, time, open space"" would center around the concept of ""taking your own path in life.""
Begin to connect and number the words in the order you want them in your song. Using the previous example, ""1. open space, 2. breeze, 3. rough road, 4. going home."" You need some open space so you go on a car ride. During the car ride you experience the breeze of the outside air. However, you begin to feel how rough the road is, so you decide to make your way back home.
It is important that the topic you choose is relatable to everyone. Since this will be a pop song, it is going to be popular to a wide range of audiences. For example, topics like sadness or longing might be more relatable to a general audience than depression.

, Every topic has already been sung about, whether it be love, sadness, happiness, longing, hope, trustworthiness, etc. The key is to either say something new about it, or say it in a different way. This is where the use of metaphor really comes in handy. The descriptions you pick up on can be transformed into a highly engaging topic about an old conversation.For example, you might notice the way a bird's feathers flutter in the wind. You can then use this detail as a metaphor for the way your life is going, i.e. up and down. Rather than just explicitly saying ""up and down"" you use a metaphor that explains your thinking.
Paint a picture with these metaphors. Do not string a whole bunch of them together randomly. For instance, if you are using the bird metaphor, stick with the bird. Talk about the way it dives, eats, sleeps, breathes, etc. That vivid imagery will capture the imaginations of your song listeners.

, Don't worry about rhyming yet, as much as writing your lyrics in complete sentences. Take your important words and build around them with active verbs, adjectives, etc. Write your lyrics as if you were writing a movie script. Tell a story using ""you"" more than you use ""I.""The basic structure of a pop song goes: verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, chorus, interlude, chorus. There are two sets of verses where you can really get into telling your story. The first verse will introduce your listener to the story. The second verse can either repeat the same sentiment of the first verse, or change the direction of your story.
The chorus has to be the same every time you sing it in order for the listener to latch on to the song. This part of the song should clearly represent the main idea you are driving at. If your song is about going home, tell the listener you are going home, either manifestly (I'm going home) or latently (I'm going back to the place where it began).
Remember, some part of the chorus will likely become the title of your song.

, Before you begin tweaking/altering your lyrics, you will want to figure out the general beat of your song. The rhythm will tell your listeners, even without words, the mood of your song. For songs about sadness, or longing, the rhythm is usually slower, while happy songs are generally more upbeat.Above each word, write full, half, or quarter notes. This will let you know how long you want to sing each word. Sad songs have a lot more full notes, while happy songs are generally full of quarter, and sometimes even eighth notes.
The chorus, of either a sad or happy pop song, will have a consistent rhythm throughout the song. When it comes to verses, sad songs have a more freewheeling style. They can go slower or faster, and change up in between. Happy songs should have both consistent chorus lines and verses respectively throughout.

, This is probably the most important part of a pop song. Pop songs are played on a radio, and therefore, there is a short time to ""hook"" the audience. The hook of your song draws them in and keeps them interested. Sit down at a piano, or pull out your guitar. Begin practicing different riffs. Alternate the riff to suit your particular song.One of the best examples of a riff is ""Satisfaction"" by the Rolling Stones. The entry to this song immediately gets the audience hooked.
Note that the riff does not necessarily have to be the same as the melody or rhythm. The hook can be used solely at the beginning to draw the audience in, or it can be used throughout and remain in the background.
A song like ""Satisfaction"" uses the riff throughout, while a song like ""Train, Train"" by Blackfoot only uses a harmonica riff at the very beginning.

, There is no perfect formula for this as there is a different melody for every song ever made. However, pop songs generally hand a mixture of repetition and variation that make the song easy to remember. Read the words of your song out loud, over and over again, until your mind begins to attach some notes to the words.One way to find inspiration for a melody is to listen to other pop songs. You might find a melody someone else used, and create a variation on it.
After you have figured out a melody for the first line of a verse, apply it to the second as well. Change the melody for the third line, and then come back to the original melody for the fourth. This is a common pattern in pop songs which creates a level of repetition that a general audience likes (1, 1, 2, 1).
Remember that melodies will change when you transition from verses to chorus lines. Pop songs have strong chorus melodies which allow the singer to belt out and become emotional (either happy or sad). Have the peak notes of your song fall within the chorus, such as extreme high notes and/or long notes.

, Pop songs generally use 3 or 4 note chord progressions. Type into Google the name of any song followed by the word ""chord"" and it will tell you what chords were used. For example, the song ""Firework"" by Katy Perry has the following chord progression: | G | Am | Em | C | Chord progressions for pop songs, like in ""Firework"" are repeated for the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.You can use chord progressions from other songs, just not lyrics or melodies. However, feel free to add or change one of the notes to suit your song best.
If you repeat a chord progression, change the scale you play it in. This creates some level of variation between the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus. For example, ""Firework"" has a steady low chord progression for the first verse. The pre-chorus ranges from low to high, and the chorus is a steady high chorus progression.
Once you have figured out what chords you would like, you can go back and attach it to the rhythm and melody. You may want to add/delete words in your lyrics as join together the rhythm, melody, and chords.

, This usually comes after you sing the chorus a second time, and before the third time. It could be a guitar solo or a piano solo. The singer might want to belt out long notes with various modulations in their voice. This interlude should flow naturally from the song, rather than being an interjection.For example, you can build on notes in chorus lines. The first time you sing the chorus, sing notes relatively short. The second time, sing them longer, stretching them out. You can then go straight into a bridge which allows you to sing the same notes for as long as you want.
Mix it up. A lot of pop songs might start an interlude with long, belted notes and then transition into a piano or guitar solo. The options are nearly endless.
Reel the interlude back in so that you can end the song. Remember, you want distinguished lines between the different sections.

, A common way to end a pop song is to simply repeat the chorus line over and over again as the song fades away. Many Aerosmith songs such as ""Love in an Elevator"" use this fading action a lot. It is best used for loud, rhythmic, hard edged chorus lines. Other, more sad songs might end better coming back to your original starting point. If you started off slow and soft, bring it back there, to effectively ""close"" your story.You can also end your song on an instrumental, however, this is usually an artistic license allotted to bands which already have names for themselves. For example, the ending to Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird"" is over five minutes worth of instrumentals.
However, you can play your basic riff a couple of times at the end of your song, just begging your audience to repeat and play again.

, After you have finished adding the music to your lyrics, you will want to go back and add your rhymes in. In modern day pop songs, there is more ""free-styling"" when it comes to lyrics but there is still a basic rhyme format. The trick of the pop song is to make it easy to remember, and rhymes facilitate that.Type a word into Google and add ""rhymes with"" next to it. A list of words will pop up and help you decide on which word best fits.
Depending on the particular word choices you may have to go back and change some of the melody/rhythm. This is a back and forth, give and take process.

, Use the strengths of the people around you to help make your song better. Find out whether a person you know plays an instrument. For example, if you are doing a very upbeat pop song, you might want someone who knows how to play a trumpet, or someone who is a good DJ.Other friends or family might be able to lend their voices to your effort, and harmonize with your melody.
You might also want to ask around for anybody that has an ""in"" into the music business. Someone who has already recorded an album, or who has worked with a record company, might be able to get your song some radio air time.

, Record it on your computer or stereo. Listen back and see if you can follow it. The words should sound crisp and clear as they will be memorized by millions of pop song listeners. There should be clear, distinguished lines between the verses, pre-chorus line, and chorus lines. Your interlude should flow naturally with the rest of the song, rather than intrude on its progression.Pop songs, like other songs, are never perfect the first go around. Rerecord the song until it is exactly right.
Note how you feel during the song. The essence of a good pop song is if you can feel the emotions you are trying to convey.

, This can literally be anything you want it to be, but it should have something to do with your topic. Often times pop songs have titles which use lines from the chorus. This makes it easier for a general audience to look up your song later on. However, if your song is very metaphorical, you may want to give your song a more obvious title.For example, if your song is about depression, but you never explicitly say it in the song, your title should reflect it.

Start with either a melody or a riff.,
Build the song's structure.,
Add drums and bass.,

Pinpoint type of metal you want to play.,
Listen to a lot of your preferred genre.,
Study music theory.",How to Write a Metal Song," There's no surefire way to start writing a song, but most people start with either a guitar riff or a vocal melody. Starting with a melody usually involves playing around with some chords on the guitar and singing over it until you find a melody you like. This can be the start of either the verse or the chorus of your song.
Starting with a riff usually involves working on the guitar until you come up with a good metal riff, something that's both catchy and driving.;
, A metal song, like rock and pop, is usually made up of a combination of verse, chorus, and bridge, with an optional intro and outro. You'll need to work with your rhythm guitarist to create a structure based around the original riff or melody you came up with. Create a chord progression for your verse and chorus, and decide if the song needs a bridge.The basic song structure of rock and metal songs goes: intro, verse, chorus, verse, solo, chorus, chorus, outro.

, After your song has a basic structure, it's time to add drums and bass. There isn't really any trick to this, other than jamming through the song with your drummer, rhythm guitarist, and bassist until your drummer and bassist have a sense of the song and what kind of beats and bass lines will work in each part.Metal bass tends to follow the chord structure closely, valuing rhythm over melody. But you aren't limited to that. Experiment with bass lines that follow the vocals, follow the lead, or do something completely different, but complementary.

, If you've got a lead guitarists, now is the time to add some lead guitar melodies to your song. It's best to try to find guitar melodies that compliment the vocal melody, and don't get in the way of it.

, Metal music deals with a wide variety of topics when it comes to lyrics. You can write about just about any subject. A good general rule of thumb for writing metal lyrics is to keep the themes simple, and the imagery and metaphors interesting.Consider, for example, this verse by Vastum, “Our depths of joy in this saturation / In our polymorphously perverse constitution / The dissolution of our grief comes in libidinal death and the grace of mourning”. It deals with simple themes of sexuality, but uses verbose and unusual language.
Consider the interesting use of extended metaphor in the song Anomalistic Offerings by Suffocation, ""The pain is unbearable, but you continue making the incision / With drill in hand, you find the seed of the demon inside / Blood spews over the walls as you drill deeper,"" in which cranial surgery is a metaphor for battling inner demons.

, Once you've got all the parts of your song in place, the structure, the melodies, the riffs, the drums, and bass, it's time to start practicing. Work on the song until the band is tight together. As you play the song, listen for places you can make improvements. Talk over your ideas about the song with the band and change it as you all see fit.


Record the band playing the song so you can listen to it more closely. That way you can spend time analyzing the individual aspects of the song on your own time.

, You can write songs without a band, but it's harder, especially for metal. Metal has a lot going on in it instrumentally, so you'll likely find writing it on your own difficult. But you can at least start the song before forming the band. And if you're multi-instrumental, meaning you have some skill with all the instruments in a metal band, you can even write the whole thing yourself if you want to.


If you want to write the song by yourself before forming a band, you'll need access to drums, a guitar, a bass, and recording equipment, at least a microphone and a computer. Then you just follow the song composing steps one by one, recording each part before moving on to the next.
If you want to start writing a song before forming a band, you can write just the rhythm guitar and vocal melody of the song. That will give the song a solid base that can be built upon once you've got some bandmates.

, Before you form a band, you need to decide how many members you want, and what instruments everyone will play. Usually metal bands consist of a drummer, as bassist, a vocalist (who may also play guitar/bass) and two guitarists, one as rhythm and the other as lead. Most bands follow this type of line up but you don’t have to have this. You could have one guitarist or no bassist for example. It's up to you., There are a number of ways to find people to be in your band. The easiest and often most effective way is to join with people you're already friends with, who have musical skill and instruments.Another way to find band members is to place an ad on a site like craigslist. Make a posting explaining your mission to form a band, what kind of music you want to play, and what roles you're looking to fill.

, There are certain characteristics you need to look for when recruiting and members. Your fellow members need to have similar tastes in music, not identical, but similar. You also need to find people who have similar levels of skill, otherwise you might have one member who holds back the rest. It's also important that everyone in the band gets along with each other. If there's some serious personality clashing in your band, it won't last very long.

, There's a wide range of sub genres within the metal genre, so it's best to pin point your style before you start. You can choose anything from black metal to grind core. Make sure all of your band members agree on a style. Some popular metal sub-genres include:Death metal, which is characterized by down-tuned guitars playing fast, intricate rhythms along with growled vocals and dark subject matter.
Power metal, which is characterized by fast tempos, melodic harmonies, and clean vocals.
Black metal, which is characterized by cold atmospheres, satanic imagery, and raspy, harsh vocals.

, It's going to be hard to write songs in a particular style without being very familiar with that style. It's likely you've already listened to plenty of music in the style you're interested in, but it will help greatly if you expand your knowledge and try to find more artists who play in that style. The more familiar you are with the conventions and particulars of a certain style, the easier it will be to start writing good metal songs.

, While no formal music education is required to write a good metal song, knowledge of music theory can only help you. You can research online to find resources for learning about the basics of music theory."

Begin singing a note.,
Close your mouth.,
Feel the vibration emerging from your nose.,
Change pitch at will.",How to Hum1," Open your mouth and begin vocalizing a certain note or pitch. Keep your lips parted slightly and your jaw, throat and diaphragm relaxed. You should feel the vibrations of the note originating at your vocal cords.The only real difference between singing and humming is that when humming, the movements of the mouth are taken out of the equation.;
, As you continue singing, bring your lips together and seal them so that no sound escapes through your mouth. This redirects the sound so that is channeled through the nose, sinuses and bones of the face. It also blunts your ability to clarify and enunciate the note, resulting in the characteristic “humming” noise.Humming is amplified to both the hummer and the listener by the movement of sound vibrations through facial bones and cavities.
If you’re not much of a singer, you can also try simply pursing your lips and making a “hmmm” noise as if you were thinking., Keep humming. After you close your mouth, the path of the vibrations will shift from the throat up and out through the nostrils. Notice the tiny, rapid vibrations in your nose and the roof of your mouth. You may feel a tickling or buzzing sensation.This is the “basic” form of humming that most people know how to do.
Humming through the nose will result in a higher-pitched, more nasal quality.

, At this point, you are officially humming. Experiment with different pitches and sounds. Force more air through the nostrils to raise your pitch, and lower the vibrations deeper into your throat to lower it.


The pitch you are able to attain should closely match that of your normal singing voice, though you may be able to hit notes that are even higher or lower while you’re humming.

"
"
Hum as you ordinarily would.,
Open up your throat.,
Focus the sound through the mouth.,
Get as much volume as you can.",How to Hum2," For this technique, you will change the point of resonance of the hum to better project the sound of your voice. Start humming. Make a note of where you feel the vibrations from the sound most strongly.


You should be able to “follow” the humming vibrations as they carry through the throat, nose and mouth.

, Continue vocalizing, keeping your mouth closed and your jaw relaxed. Now, as you hum, allow your throat to expand as though you were coughing or attempting to hit the lowest note you possibly can. Your larynx will tighten and draw downward.Getting your throat in the right position is not as easy as it sounds. Work on lowering the pitch of the notes as you hum and try to feel when your larynx sinks. With a little practice, you’ll get the hang of it.

, You are now in a better position to project the hum through your mouth. Let the vibrations fill your cheeks. Push with your diaphragm as you exhale. If you feel a tickle in your lips or the lower portion of your face begins to tingle, you’re doing it right.Keep your lips tightly sealed so that the sound is amplified by your throat and the hollows of your cheeks.
Projecting through the mouth lets you hum, and therefore sing, with greater volume and clarity.

, Now that you’re able to project the vibrations of your vocal cords through your mouth, try to hum more forcefully. Squeeze your diaphragm to push more air out and keep your throat opened up. You should be able to achieve a louder, more booming hum this way than the thin, nasally quality of the basic technique of humming through the nose.Most of your volume should come from the diaphragm, not the voice box. It is only being conducted through the mouth.This is the “right” way to hum as a trained singer.

"
"
Hum to prepare your vocal cords.,
Alternate between a high and low hum.,
Run through musical scales.,
Hum as you breathe.",How to Hum3," Just as an athlete limbers up before exercising, it’s important to warm up your voice before doing any singing, public speaking or yelling. Spend a few minutes humming to work out the tension in your voicebox. Humming is a great way to get your vocal cords loose and ready for the stress of projecting sound.It is possible to damage your voice if you produce loud, prolonged sounds without a proper warm-up.Warming up your vocal cords can even make your normal speaking voice smoother and more pleasant.

, When getting ready to sing or deliver a speech, try getting your voice ready by humming in different pitches. Carry the sound through both your nose and your mouth, switching from one to the other as you transition. Hit each note as high or as low as you can.The higher the hum, the more you will feel it in your nose and up in the sinuses and forehead. As you lower the note, the vibrations will sink into your through and resound in your chest., Singers can incorporate humming into their vocal warm-up exercises with great results. Practice reciting harmonic scales the way you ordinarily would, only hum rather than sing. Maintain a steady, constant pitch as you work your way through the ascending and descending notes. Good singing technique should be observed before you even open your mouth!Humming eliminates the need to focus on lyrics or shape words as you warm up, allowing you to focus purely on hitting the right pitch., Humming can be very relaxing when used as a meditation technique. Find a quiet place to sit and relax your throat and diaphragm. Take a deep breath in and hold it for a moment or two. Release the breath slowly, humming as you exhale. The hum should ride out naturally on top of the breath.During this exercise, you should not be making an attempt to project or exhale forcefully. Simply let the hum escape as you breathe. Exhale and hold a gentle hum for as long as you can.
Humming while breathing is a good way to clear your head, relax your body and alleviate stress.

Listen to grunge.,
Use distortion and/or overdrive.,
Have and know how to use a chorus, echo and/or reverb pedal.,
Know how to make use of non-standard tunings in your songs.,
Like all music, think of how you want your band/music to sound.,
Use a balanced amount of power chords.,
Try to make the guitar sound unusual in tone.,
It is recommended you use both clean parts and distorted riffs in your song.,
Have a powerful vocal melody.,
Now that you're done with music, move on to lyrics.,
If starting a band, keep the following in mind:


The guitarist must be talented and have melody in his/her playing.",How to Write a Grunge Song," You can't write a grunge song if you don't know how grunge sounds! Listen to the bands named above; learn to play their songs; look up what type of guitars, amps and pedals they use.


If you can, it is really important you listen to not just those bands, but the bands that inspired them. Bands like Black Sabbath and the Doors gave them the dark, gloomy sound, while blues guitarists can help you with the lead guitar playing.;
, Distortion is essential for harder rock genres, and especially metal. An important part of grunge is alternating between distorted and clean.


If you don't have a big budget, some amps have an overdrive button installed. If you can afford it, you can't go wrong with a good quality pedal.
Make sure you know how and when to use distortion to good effect in a song. Be careful not to use too much gain - amateur guitarists will always assume gain = heaviness, but this simply isn't true.

, A very important part of the grunge sound found in the likes of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden is an ambient reverb sound on a clean guitar.

, Eb is the recommended tuning. Of course, standard tuning can still produce heaviness if you're talented enough.


Many grunge bands use unconventional tunings to good effect. ""Mind Riot"" by Soundgarden (a very experimental band) has every string tuned to an E.

, How hard you want it to be, what kind of riff you want, the meaning of the lyrics.

, Power chords are an important basis of rock music in general. Avoid making riffs/songs based entirely on three or four power chords and try to be experimental; this isn't punk rock!

, Guitarist Jerry Cantrell used talk box and wah-pedals, and Kim Thayil used a similar setup as well as unconventional techniques for his.

, The famous clean-verse-distorted-chorus structure is an important part of grunge and is found in many famous songs, such as Alice in Chains' ""Rooster"", Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" and Nirvana's ""Heart Shaped Box"".

, The biggest grunge vocalists - Layne Staley, Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Scott Weiland - are all considered among the most talented vocalists in rock music history. Your melody should force the vocalist into their full potential.

, Keep them poetic, but not meaningless. Grunge lyrics are often odd and confusing out of context, but once they are analysed they are incredibly meaningful. Grunge lyrics are almost always personal, with emphasis on writing about how you feel (or alternative, storytelling that is equally emotional) and less on political or fantastical ideas.

, A background in blues and country helps. Shredding is great in thrash, not so much in grunge.
The band should have a competent bassist. Although underrated, the bassist is incredibly important to the rhythm and essential to a deep, heavy sound. The bassist should be audible in the mix, and basslines should be distinct from the guitar riffs.
Your drummer has to be skilled. Grunge drumbeats are very metal-esque. He/she should not only be able to play fast, but know progressive skills like switching time signatures and tempo changes. Grunge is experimental, and the beat is important to keeping the music together.
Above all, the vocalist must be well-trained. He/she should have a big range (a strong baritone is recommended) and plenty of stamina.

"
"
As always, warm up your voice with simple vocal exercises, such as humming through ascending arpeggios etcetera before you sing.,
Identify the high note you want to hit.,
Sing the note an octave below it first.,
Place your voice high up in your head (above your cheekbones, or even above your eyebrows).,
Remember that though your voice is placed in your head, it first stemmed from your diaphragm.,
Practice singing the two notes an octave apart for many times.","How to Hit the High Notes, Classical Style"," Go as high up as you can for your vocal range without straining your throat.;
, Ensure that this note is within an achievable range. Preferably, it was the last or penultimate note you could comfortably reach during the warm-up exercises.

, Next, breathe deeply into your diaphragm and back, and simultaneously drop your inner jaw and raise your soft palette without also dropping your tongue or raising your larynx. If this sounds hard to execute in a split second, it is.

, It helps to imagine that the top of your head is big and empty. Now sing the high note with gentle yet firm support from your lower body. You should have the sensation that you are hollering.

, While singing, your voice should reverberate in your head first before being projected outside of your body.

, Move on once you manage to achieve a rich tone for your high note.

"

Breathe in quickly and steadily.,
Breathe out slowly.,
Let no air escape.,
Hiss.,
Lie on your back and breathe.,
Use the Farinelli technique.,
Raise your sternum.,
Engage the muscles that effect your diaphragm.,
Check for tongue tension.",How to Hold a Note," Singing uses more breath than speaking, so you might be tempted to gulp your lungs full of air. This is not as helpful as taking steady quick breaths while you sing. Practice drawing in ordinary amounts of air at the beginning of each phrase you sing.If you catch yourself gulping or gasping, pause and begin again. Trust your lungs to do their job.
You will need more air to sing long notes, but you'll get more duration of a slow exhalation than you will out of a deep inhalation.;
, Your breath carries your voice. If you force out air, or try to choke it back, you will not be able to hold long notes. As you sing, notice yourself pushing or halting your exhalation. If you are pushing, you may sound shouty or breathy. Relax your abdominal muscles and try again.If you are choking your exhalation, try this exercise: sing a vowel at a pitch in the middle of your range, then gradually shift the note to being a stream of air with no vocalization.
Once you have mastered moving gradually from a clean tone to a breathy tone to no tone while maintaining pitch, you can try the technique on higher notes.
Notes that are held are often high, so this is an exceptionally useful exercise.

, You need breath to sustain a note. Practice singing without releasing air by listening to your voice. Do you sound breathy? Try to sing the same note again, clearly. Hold a mirror in front of your mouth while you sing the note. The mirror will fog up if you are releasing breath.


Generally, trying to actively control the flow of your breath will cause you to inadvertently choke or force the air, leading to uneven tone and loss of breath.

, Breathe in, and exhale while saying ""SSSS."" Release your breath evenly and entirely. Do it again, trying (without pressing or forcing) to say ""SSSS"" for slightly longer. Don't press or force your ""S,"" but try to release your air evenly and slowly. Incorporate this exercise into your regular warm-up routine., Lie on the floor with your knees up, and inhale and exhale slowly. Feel your back press into the floor. Balance a book on your stomach and exhale. The book should rise: you want to be breathing into your belly, not your chest.This exercise helps you regulate your breathing and can train you to trust your lower back to support your voice.

, In this technique, you will breathe in for three seconds, hold your breath for three seconds, and release your breathe for three seconds. Your inhalation, hold, and exhalation of breath should be even and should not leave you gasping for air. Once you have completed the cycle smoothly, go immediately into the next cycle, this time breathing, holding, and exhaling for four seconds each.Do as many cycles as you comfortably can, each time adding a second per stage.
Stop when you feel abdominal pressure or lightheadedness.
Six cycles is probably your maximum for your first round, unless you are already a trained vocalist.
Once you have reached your maximum, repeat the exercise in reverse, subtracting one second per cycle.
Use a stopwatch or metronome.
Do this daily, increasing your seconds per cycle, without pausing between cycles.

, Raise your arms over your head as you inhale. Keeping your sternum in the same position, lower your arms as you exhale. Another technique is to layer your hands on your lower back, palms outward. Practice the posture of singing with a lifted sternum until it becomes natural.Singing with good posture will help you sustain high notes. Your sternum should be raised, and your chest should stay in the same position. Sing in front of a mirror to monitor your posture.

, Before you sing, spend a moment flexing and noticing the muscles of your lower abdomen, lumbar spine, and pelvic floor. As you sing, check in again with these muscles, and engage them if they are relaxed. The air flowing through your diaphragm is controlled by these muscles, and engaging them allows you to control the flow of your breath.Use your lower abdomen, lumbar spine, and pelvic floor muscles whenever a vocal coach tells you to ""use your diaphragm.""
Use this technique rather than that of contracting your abdominal muscles. This will cause uneven pressure and result in injury., When you sing long notes, which are often high notes, you need your tongue to be relaxed. As you sing, check if your tongue is tense. Push your thumb underneath your chin, which is where the bottom of your tongue is rooted. If you feel tension, massage under your chin while continuing to sing.


This will help you practice relaxing your tongue as you hold those long high notes.

"
Know what harmony is.,
Form a chord with the melody.,
Try the most basic chords (1-3-5) like ""C-E-G."" The 1 represents the 'root' note, then skip one up to note 3 that represents the 3rd (the note 2 places up from the first one).,
Practice singing harmony, by trying harmony with a keyboard or a piano.,
Sing along with a recorded song the way you're supposed to.,
Try to sing a little bit higher or lower in pitch.,
Realize this might sound awful when you first try it.,
Harmonizing to a great degree is intuitive.",How to Harmonize," Harmony - Noun: the combination of simultaneously sounded musical notes to produce a pleasing effect. The term harmony is used to refer to notes that, basically, sound good together! The melody consists of the essential notes that form the basic structure of any tune. Harmony requires at least 2 tones or voices and can be done with any number of additional tones or voices. Most harmony is written for 3 to 6 voice parts. Some arrangements go to as many as 8 or more parts, but these are uncommon.

A good step to harmonizing is to fully know the melody, and then sing to it in a slightly lower pitch not an octave low. If you have another person with you, it also helps to sing with a piano first, and then move on to singing and harmonizing more independently.
Once you have some sense of the basic 1,3,5 major chord -- or 1,3,5,7 major 7th chord -- you can harmonize by singing any of the notes. The 1 is the soprano or lead (Lead is singing soprano an octave low for a male or female with a lower alto voice.). The more people you have the more of the notes you can sing. Once you have a sense of the basics of harmony in some key, you can experiment with other notes in other, such chords.;
, A chord is when 3 or more notes are played or sung at once (in tones, or voices). These notes are often referred to as triads with 3 tones (1,3,5 intervals) the most basic chord for harmonizing, the 1,3,5 chord.

, Then skip from the 3rd to place 5 which represents the 5th (or the note 4 places up from the root and 2 places up from the 3rd). You can also have 1-3-5-7 by adding the 7th and/or the 1st (root) note up or down the octave.

, When you play a piano, a good note to harmonize is: Assuming a C major scale, strike the C note and, then strike 2 together with your harmonizing note (two) which is found by skipping the next note, and singing the next one in the same direction, from the original note. But that's rather crude.

, Slower songs like hymns are easier.

, Try to sing along at this higher or lower pitch and have it sound good.

, Just continually try to sing a little higher or lower than the original and have it sound good. If it sounds bad, then you're not harmonizing. If it sounds good, then you probably are.

, You learn what sounds right and wrong, and that proves that you know the right/wrong notes. Just loosen up and try to sing at the slightly higher (or lower) pitch... If you play an instrument like a guitar or piano you can find the harmony by first playing the note you are singing then move that note up to the 3rd on the scale (in the key) of the song you are playing like C (C-E-G) or G (G-B-D); notice they skip a letter, but of course sharps and/or flats are found in many keys which is usually the black keys on a piano type of keyboard.

Consult your doctor.,
Rest your voice.,
Drink water.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Heal Your Vocal Chords1," Make sure to consult your laryngologist first before using at-home remedies to heal your vocal chords. Your laryngologist will be able to diagnose the problem and prescribe a treatment for your specific case.For mild cases, your doctor may prescribe voice rest.
For moderate to severe cases, your doctor may prescribe cough depressants or antibiotics in addition to voice rest.
For severe cases, your doctor may prescribe surgery to fix the issue, especially if you have nodules on your vocal chords.;
, Depending on the severity of the damage, you should rest your voice for one to five days. To rest your voice you must avoid any kind of speaking, as well as activities that may strain your vocal chords like strenuous exercise and heavy lifting. Write things down if you need to communicate to others.If you must talk, then take a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of talking.
Do not substitute whispering for talking. Whispering actually places more strain on your vocal chords than regular talking.Activities you can do while resting your voice are reading, breathing exercises, sleeping, and watching movies or TV.

, Drinking water will help keep your vocal chords lubricated, which can help promote healing. Keep a water bottle with you so you can refresh your throat whenever it feels dry.At the same time, you should try to avoid liquids that can prevent a speedy recovery such as alcohol, caffeine, and sugary drinks.

, Sleep also enables your vocal chords to rest and heal. Therefore, make sure you are getting at least seven hours of sleep each night while they are healing.If you are taking a day or two off from work or school to rest your vocal chords, try not to go to bed too late.

Heat a cup (236.6 ml) of water.,
Mix in two tablespoons (30 ml) of honey.,
Gargle for 20 seconds.",How to Heal Your Vocal Chords2," In the microwave or on the stove, heat a cup of water until it is warm. Warm water is around 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 to 37.8 degrees Celsius). Make sure the water is not too hot (or too cold) as this can irritate your vocal chords.For the best results, use filtered or bottled water.

, Mix the honey in the warm water until it is dissolved. At this point, you can also mix in herb extracts that have been recommended by your doctor. Mix three to five drops of the extract into the water.Herbs that are known to help sooth and heal your throat and vocal chords are cayenne pepper, licorice, marshmallow, propolis, sage, slippery elm and turmeric.

, Take a sip of the liquid and tilt your head back. Allow the liquid to go as far back in your throat as possible without swallowing it. Softly blow air from the back of your throat to start gargling. Make sure to spit out the liquid once you finish gargling.For each session, gargle three times. Gargle every two to three hours throughout the day.
Make sure to gargle before you go to bed. This way the herbs and honey can soothe and treat your vocal chords while you sleep.

Pour the hot water in a bowl.,
Drape a towel over your head and shoulders.,
Breathe in the steam.",How to Heal Your Vocal Chords3," Pour six cups of water into a pot. Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to medium-high. Once the water starts to steam or evaporate (about eight to ten minutes), turn off the heat and take the pot off the stove.Water that is 150 degrees Fahrenheit will provide enough steam.
If the water is boiling then it is too hot. Let the water cool for a minute or two before you begin the steam inhalation.

, Place a bowl on a table and pour the hot water into it. You may add herbal extracts to the water at this point. Add five to eight drops of extract to the water.You can add herbal extracts like chamomile, thyme, peppermint, lemon, oregano, and clove to the water for added benefits.

, While you are sitting, lean over the bowl at a comfortable distance away from the steam. Place a towel over your head, shoulders, and the bowl to create an enclosure.This will trap the steam so you can breathe it in.

, You only need to breathe the steam in for eight to ten minutes for this to be effective. Set a timer to keep track of the time. Once you have finished the steam inhalation, try not speak for 30 minutes afterwards. This will enable your vocal chords to rest and heal after the procedure."

Set up an appointment with a voice therapist.,
Receive a bulk injection.,
Get surgery.",How to Heal Your Vocal Chords4," A voice therapist will help you strengthen your vocal chords through various exercises and activities. Depending on the severity of the damage, your voice therapist may also help you recover breath control while speaking, as well as regain muscle control around the damaged vocal chord to prevent abnormal tension or to protect your airways while swallowing., Bulk injections are done by your laryngologist. It consists of injecting your damaged vocal chord with collagen, body fat or another approved substance to enlarge the chord. This enables your vocal chords to make closer contact when speaking. This procedure may improve your speech and reduce pain when swallowing and coughing., If voice therapy and/or bulk injections do not improve your situation, then your doctor may suggest surgery. Surgery may consist of structural implants (thyroplasty), the repositioning of your vocal chords, nerve replacement (reinnervation), or a tracheotomy. Discuss the options with your doctor to see which procedure fits your individual situation and needs.Thyroplasty consists of using an implant to reposition your vocal chord.
Vocal chord repositioning consists of moving your vocal chords closer together by moving tissue from the outside of your vocal box toward the inside.
Reinnervation consists of replacing the damaged vocal chord with a healthy nerve from a different area of your neck.
A tracheotomy consists of making an incision in your neck to create an opening to access your windpipe. A tube will be inserted in the opening to allow air to bypass the damaged vocal chords.

Relax your vocal chords before you start singing.,
Don't force the high notes.,

, When you need to hit a high note, don't try too hard or tighten up. Relax and let your voice rise smoothly, but still maintain control. If you force your voice, you will end up hitting a bad note.

, Cold water will shock and tighten your vocal chords.
Avoid milk, soft drinks, and other similar drinks because the lactose in milk and the other sugars (and sugar substitutes) in soft drinks can cause phlegm and mucus to build up in your throat.

, Make a habit of breathing from your diaphragm, by doing it consistently for weeks, instead of gasping and/or heaving with your chest for air. If you are breathing properly, the bottom part of your belly will expand, not your rib cage.

, The right time to breathe while singing is between phrases (word groups sung together). In ordinary writing, phrases are often set off by commas or other punctuation, but punctuation may be absent from lyrics. Scan the lyrics before you start singing. Figure out where natural pauses and breaks are. When singing, take breaths at these breaks. You have to practice phrasing/breathing so that you can sing without straining, gasping for breath or running out of air.

, Record yourself while singing to see whether your voice sounds pleasant or irritating. Listen to your voice with an open mind, and don't try to convince yourself that it sounds right, if it really doesn't.

, Try to make your timing and phrasing fit the song better. Experiment with varying amounts of nasal and chest tones, timbres, accents and styles to see what suits you. Have a good friend listen who can give you constructive and helpful criticism.

, Looking at people while singing may feel awkward at first, but with practice you get used to it. If singing for an audience makes you nervous, try looking at their foreheads or over their shoulders. Practice singing in front of a mirror before you perform for an audience.

, Try performing before friends or family, whichever you feel more comfortable with. Family members will usually try to sugarcoat reactions and not tell you their true opinions, while good friends may be more open and free with their thoughts. Be ready to laugh at yourself., It might just end up being a massive success for you!, Talent helps -- but persistence is most important! Continue developing your song list, vocal techniques, voice strength and stage presence. Continue learning to ""sell your song"" to the audience, using hand motions (a hand on your heart, temple or pointing to the heavens, walking a little, each at the right moment), with sincerity, maybe a slight ""tear"" of sorrow in your voice -- or humorous timing -- as fits each song. Just don't give up.

Collaborate with other artists.",How to Get Noticed As a Singer," To get noticed and make it big as a singer, you must practice as much as possible, the same way that professional athletes train all the time, and the same way that musicians practice their instruments constantly. After all, when you're a singer, your voice is your instrument, and you need to be proficient with it!


Even if you're already an excellent singer, take vocal lessons. A singing instructor can teach you how to project and protect your voice, to practice properly, and to expand your vocal range, as well as show you new techniques.;
, Getting noticed in the music industry isn't easy, but it will help if you have a different sound—something that hasn’t already been done by a hundred other singers—to catch people’s attention.You can develop a distinctive sound by having a unique voice, playing with an exotic accompanying instrument, using different vocal or production effects, or doing something else to set your sound apart.
Instead of trying to sound like your influences, add your own personal style to your voice and your music. Don’t be afraid to express yourself.

, Singers are artists and performers, and one component of that performance should be a unique look and style that helps define you and make you memorable.This style should complement your distinctive sound, but the important thing is feeling comfortable with yourself.


For instance, if you aren't comfortable wearing a full spandex suit in neon green, don’t do it just to gain attention. Your performance will be affected if you aren't comfortable with the way you look and feel.
Kiss is a great example of a band that made a very unique look for themselves to help promote their music. In fact, the style they created was so successful that even people who have never heard their music can identify the band by their costumes and makeup.

, The road to success in the music industry is a long and hard one, and it takes positivity, persistence, and determination to make it. You must believe in yourself and have confidence in your own talent,otherwise you'll never find the courage to get on stage, contact an agent, or send out your demo.


Being able to ignore detractors can be just as important as having a positive attitude. Especially in today’s connected world of social media, comment sections, and Internet trolls, there will always be people who have negative things to say, and you will have to learn to ignore them., Playing gigs or shows will get your music heard, help you create a local fan base, and help you create a name for yourself.Gigs come in all shapes and sizes, and when you're first starting out, any bit of exposure you get is a bonus. You can play at gigs and events such as:


Charity events
Local sports games
Bars, clubs, lounges, and coffee shopsWeddings and parties
Concerts, exhibitions, and battle of the bands nights

, One of the first major milestones of all bands or singers is the recording of their first demo song or album. A demo is something that you can distribute far and wide, sell at gigs, and use to promote yourself and your music.


There are thousands of independent and local recording studios out there you can use to record a single or a few tracks, and you might be surprised to find that there's even one in your town. A quick Internet search should give you an idea of where to go to record some music.

, In order to do this, you need an idea of what genre of music you play. think about what musicians inspired you, what other musicians you sound similar to, and what kind of people your music might appeal to.


Knowing your sound is important because it can help you direct your music at your target audience. For instance, if you're a rapper, you might want to consider booking yourself a gig at a local poetry slam rather than at a country bar.
Understanding your audience can also help you when you want to stand out in a crowd. For example, if you know your music appeals to cat lovers for some reason, you could book yourself a show at a local animal shelter fundraiser., This is an absolute must in the modern world of new music. More and more often, it’s YouTube, Facebook, and other social media and networking sites that are responsible for musical fame,rather than the traditional record label. If you want to reach more people, use the Internet to distribute your own music.


For starters, you should have accounts with all the popular social media sites for your music. This includes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Myspace, Bandcamp, Buzznet, and more.Take videos and recordings of all your performances, and share them on your social media pages. Be sure to include links where people can also purchase the demos and tracks you’ve recorded professionally.

, Stay in touch with friends and fans via social media, and encourage them to share your recordings and performances with their friends. You can even offer special perks and offers to friends who share the most or get you the most followers or likes., Traditionally, one of the best ways to get discovered in the music industry was to send your demo to as many people as possible. While this may no longer be the ultimate way to get recognized as a singer, it is still an important step. If you're sending out physical copies, be sure to write your contact info directly on each CD. Send your demo to:Blogs and music reviewersRecord producers and executives
Band managers who work with acts similar to yours

, Agents are great resources because of the connections they have, their ability to negotiate, and their experience in the music industry. It’s not essential to have an agent, but having one can afford you a certain level of protection, takes some pressure off you (because they can take care of bookings on your behalf), and gives you a certain level of professionalism., this includes sending your music to local radio stations, college and university radio stations, and web radio stations.When you send your music, be sure to address specific DJs, presenters, and show producers.Try to target specialty shows and stations that might be more open to independent acts.

, Working on projects with other artists is a great way to open yourself up to a new audience and get yourself heard by new groups of people. Work with artists who also have established fan bases, and that way you'll get your name out there faster.Don’t just focus on musical artists when you're considering a collaboration. Artistic crossover can happen with dancers, visual artists, poets, and filmmakers, and this can give you an even larger audience.

Learn in advance what show it is you're auditioning for, and what role you want to play.,
Google search!,
Find the audition scenes/a suitable monologue.",How to Get the Lead in the School Musical1," You can't suit your audition towards a certain role if you don't know what the characters are like!


For example, if the show is ""Wicked,"" you'll want to research the show, the characters and their traits, and listen to the songs on loop constantly until your audition.
If your show is lesser known or written by teachers or students, ask the directors or playwrights in advance about the characters and the themes of the show. It will help you get a grasp on what you need to know.;
, Also known as a Show Stalk, this is an intense session where one looks up the show they're auditioning for on the Internet in whatever way they can (including all search engines and avenues for research), finding their desired characters and everything about them.

, If you're given audition scenes by the directors, print copies and rehearse them with as many people as will agree to help you. Practice any scenes that make you uncomfortable as much as possible, after all, you want to show your versatility. If required, look for a monologue that is not from the show itself but has the same ""air"" as the character you're auditioning for. For example, if you're auditioning for the role of a 1950s housewife, don't pick something from a modern production featuring a ten year old child.


Remember: In the actual audition, don't try to play down on the scenes you read for that aren't on the character you want. If you want to play a beautiful woman and are asked to read for a baseball player, act like a baseball player! This has proven particularly well for myself in particular- The directors will be looking for you to be versatile and ready for anything, and if that means reading for a baseball player, pretend to chew that Juicy Fruit and slouch. Convince them that every second you have on that stage will be used to the best of your abilities, instead of only craving your shining moment.

"
"
Check the song requirements for the audition.,
Know your own voice.,
Find out if the character you want has a matching voice part.,
Unless you're asked to, don't sing a song from the show.,
Look through a theatre anthology/collection and choose something you can easily memorize or learn quickly.",How to Get the Lead in the School Musical2," There's a good chance that they'll ask you to sing a pre-requested song from the show, maybe you'll be asked to sing whatever shows your best abilities. For most shows, it's the exact opposite. Whatever you're asked to do, follow the requirements.

, For females, a soprano hits the highest notes (Common), a mezzo hits the middle notes (uncommon), and altos hit the lowest notes (Relatively uncommon). Some people have very limited ranges, and some women can hit everything from a low C# to a high C#. For males, tenors hit the highest notes, baritones hit the middle notes, basses hit the lowest notes, and, rarest of all, countertenors can reach well into a female range. When determining your voice range, choose whatever feels the most comfortable for you to sing loudly (belt/chest voice) without hurting yourself. Often times, a skilled voice teacher can help you analyze what your voice part is.

, Also, if you're not a music buff and are still unsure about if you and the character have compatible voice parts, try to sing the songs from the production online with a recording in the same key and see if you can hit all of the notes in the same way that the original singer did. And, even if you can't hit that low G in that same rich quality as the original Broadway singer did, don't get discouraged- This could be partially because of range or partially because of a lack of training in that area.

, That is considered theatrical suicide and shows desperation for a certain role, which just shows the directors that you have a lack of experience. Other unspoken no-nos are Happy Birthday, any nursery rhymes, and rap (unless your desired character has songs that resemble works by Nicki Minaj or Eminem).

, Also, don't skimp on acting in the song! It is recommended that you do not use props, however.

"
"
Dress for success!,
Keep hydrated!,
Be respectful!,
Be friendly!,
Follow the rules of acting!,
Be confident!",How to Get the Lead in the School Musical3," It sounds cheesy, but dress up in something that makes you feel confident, and reflect the character if at all possible. If you choose to do this, however, don't go overboard. If you're auditioning for the role of a farmer, it's usually better to look rather tired and a little bit messy rather than full-on overalls and a straw hat. Girls, make sure your outfit is modest and won't offend or distract the people watching your audition. Over-sexualising or dressing as you would to go to a party might not leave the best impression for people looking for a mature student for a good role. It's better to dress up than dress down, and the bare minimum you should go for is jeans and a (CLEAN) tee shirt.

, A lot of actors get dehydrated before an audition and can't sing to the best of their abilities. Also, make sure you're well-rested and study your material before you enter the audition room.

, If you disrespect the panel you're auditioning for, they might disregard your audition altogether and not assign you a role. Be kind and control your emotions until you're done with the audition. Also, this will show self-control, which directors always like in their leads.

, This goes with being respectful, but in addition to that, leaving a good impression on the directors never hurts. Of course, it's never good to kiss someone's butt (metaphorically, of course) in order to get the role you'd like, but chatting the panel up and showing them that you're easy to work with and talk to is a plus on their (also probably metaphorical) scorecard. Small talk and being friendly is an adapted skill, so if you can pull it off, you're showing that you're mature and experienced not only onstage, but also in life.

, Articulate, enunciate, read clearly and slowly, with character behind the lines. Remember, you're auditioning for a role that you'll have to portray. You have to become that person on-stage. Unless you're trying to communicate directly with the audience, you have to ignore the fact that they're there. Don't let them distract you; the theatre term for this is to ""Build the Fourth Wall.""

, You're probably better prepared than you think you are if you follow the above steps, and having confidence only helps your case.

Translate your vocal range into a voice type.",How to Find Your Vocal Range," Many people have heard the terms soprano, tenor, or bass, but may not know to what they actually refer. In opera, voices are another instrument that must reach particular notes on demand, just like a violin or flute. Consequently, range classifications were developed to help identify voice types, which made it easier to cast opera singers for specific parts.While most people aren’t trying out for opera these days, being aware of your voice type helps you be more aware of the notes you can reach when performing other types of music, either solo or in choirs. Informally, it can even help you figure out which songs you can effectively cover when singing karaoke.
The different voice types descending from highest to lowest are: soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. Each type has a typical associated vocal range.;
, You can divide range classifications into categories based on their respective vocal registers. Each register has a distinct timbre and is produced by a different action of your vocal cords. Accurately assessing your vocal range requires investigating the breadth of more than one type of vocal register, primarily those of your “modal” and “head” voices, and, in special cases, those of your “fry” and “whistle” voices.Your modal (or chest) voice is essentially your comfortable singing range when the vocal folds are in their natural manner of action. These are the notes you can reach without adding a low, breathy or high, falsetto quality to your voice. The range of notes that you can hit comfortably in your modal voice comprise your “tessitura.”Your head voice includes the high end of your range, produced with elongated vocal folds. It’s called “head voice” because it refers to those notes that feel the most resonant in one’s head and have a distinct ringing quality. Falsetto--the voice most people use when impersonating female opera singers--is included in the head-voice register.For some very low-voiced males, the lowest vocal register, called “vocal fry” is also added, but many people cannot even reach this low end. These notes are produced by floppy, vibrating vocal folds that create low, creaking or croaking notes.Just as the “vocal fry” register extends to super-low notes for some men, the “whistle register” extends to super-high notes for some women. The whistle register is an extension of the head voice, but its timbre is distinctly different, sounding not unlike, well, a whistle. Think: the infamous highest notes in a song like “Lovin’ You” by Minnie Riperton or “Emotion” by Mariah Carey., An octave is the interval between two like notes (for instance B to B), the higher of which has twice the sound frequency of the lower. On a piano, octaves will span eight keys (excluding the black ones). One way to characterize your vocal range is by expressing the number of octaves that range spans.The octave also corresponds with standard musical scales, which are typically comprised of eight ordered notes in ascending or descending order (for instance, C D E F G A B C). The interval between the first and last note of a scale is an octave.

, Scientific pitch notation is a standardized way of writing and understanding musical notes using letters (that identify the notes, A through G) and ordinal numbers (that identify the correct octave, from low to high, starting with zero on up).


For instance, the lowest pitch on most pianos is A0, making the next octave above it A1 and so on. What we deem “Middle C” on a piano is actually C4 in scientific pitch notation.
Since the Key of C is the only major key with no sharps or flats (and, thus, uses only the white keys on a piano), scientific pitch notation counts octaves starting with “C” notes rather than “A” notes. This means that though the lowest pitch on the far left-hand side of a keyboard is A0, the first “C” that occurs two white keys to the right is C1 and so on. Hence, the first A note that appears higher than Middle C (C4) will be A4, not A5.
The full expression of your vocal range will include three of four different scientific pitch notation numbers, including your lowest note, highest note in modal voice, and highest note in head voice. Those who can reach the vocal fry and whistle registers may have pitch notation numbers for those as well, always ranging from the lowest notation note to the highest.

, The easiest way to identify your range is with the assistance of a tuned instrument that you can play while you sing, like a piano or keyboard. If you do not have access to the physical instrument, download a piano app, such as Virtual Piano, on your smartphone, tablet, or other device as a substitute.


Using an online piano on your laptop or device will give you access to a full simulated keyboard. It will also make it much easier to figure out which notes are your highest and lowest because the app will actually indicate the correct scientific pitch notation for a key as you play it.

, Start by figuring out what the bottom end of your natural range is by locating the lowest note that you can sing comfortably without your voice croaking or cracking. You should also not have to “breathe” the note; that is, its tone quality should match that of the rest of your chest voice and not have a breathy or scratchy sound.Instead of trying to pull your lowest note out of thin air, start by singing a higher note on a consistent vowel sound (like “ah” or “ee” or “oo”) and work your way down the scale into your lowest registers.
If you’re a woman, start with an easy C4 (middle C on the piano), and work your way down the keys, matching each note until you hit your lowest. If you’re a man, play a C3 on the piano, and go down one key at a time from there.
The goal is to find the lowest note you can still sing comfortably, so do not count notes that you cannot sustain.

, Once you know how far down your voice can reach comfortably, try to go a bit lower, key by key and note by note. Breathy notes that you can sustain count here, but croaky notes that you cannot hold do not.For some singers their normal and breathy lowest notes may coincide. For others, they might not.

, Once you have found your lowest normal-voiced note and the lowest one you can reach, write them down. Do so by identifying the piano key that corresponds to the note and then figuring out its correct scientific pitch notation.For example, if the lowest note you can hit as you descend the scale is the second-to-last E on the keyboard, then you’d write down E2.

, You want to do the same thing you did for low notes but for the high end of the scale. Start with a higher note that you have no problem reaching, and ascend the scale key by key, but do not let yourself go into falsetto for this exercise.


If you’re a woman, start by playing a C5 and work your way up from there, key by key. If you’re a man, start by playing and matching a G3.
You want to find the highest note you can hit without significantly changing your tone quality or the natural action of your vocal cords. If you hear a break or new breathiness in your voice or feel a difference in how your vocal cords are working to produce a note, then you’ve passed your modal register.

, Most people can use falsetto, a mode in which your vocal cords remain open and relaxed and vibrate much less, to go lighter and higher than they can in their modal register. Now that you’ve found the highest note you can sing comfortably, relax your vocal cords, and see if you can push yourself a bit higher beyond your normal voice. Use your breathier, flute-like falsetto voice to find the highest notes you can reach without straining or cracking.If you find that you can go further still beyond your falsetto to high notes that sound like whistles or squeals, you may well have a whistle voice, too. Your highest note will fall in that register.

, Now that you’ve located your highest notes, write them down in scientific pitch notation. Again, you want to track the highest notes you can reach without straining. Some of these notes may not sound wonderful before you’ve given them more practice, but include them as long as you can reach them comfortably.For example, if your highest note in your normal voice is the fourth ascending F on the keyboard, then you would write down F4 and so on.

, You should now have four notes, two low and two high, written down in scientific pitch notation. Arrange them from lowest to highest. Put parentheses around the lowest and highest pitches and a dash in between the middle two. This notation expresses your full vocal range.


For instance, if your collection of numbers reads D2, G2, F4, and B4, the correct notation for your range would read: (D2)G2-F4(B4).
The outer two notes in parentheses represent your full range, that is, all the notes that your body is capable of producing.
The two middle pitches (such as, “G2-F4” in the above example) represent your “tessitura,” that is, the range in which you can most comfortably sing using your normal voice. This is helpful to know when you are selecting the appropriate voice type for singing music., Using a keyboard, count the notes between the lowest note you could sing and the highest.Do not include include the sharps and flats (black keys) in your count., Every eight notes is one octave. A to A, for instance, is an octave. However, the last A will also count as the start of the next octave. You can, therefore, determine the number of octaves in your vocal range by counting the total number of notes between your highest and lowest pitches as sets of seven.For example, if your lowest note was E2 and your highest note was E4, then you have a range of two octaves.

, It’s normal, for example, for someone to have a range of 1.5 octaves in full voice. The reason for the half is because the person could only comfortably sing three or four notes in the next octave.

, Now that you have your vocal range written down using scientific pitch notation, you can use it to determine your vocal classification. Each voice type has an associated range; find which type aligns your full range.The typical ranges for each voice type are as follows: soprano B3-G6, mezzo-soprano G3-A5, alto E3-F5, countertenor G3-C6, tenor C3-B4, baritone G2-G4, bass D2-E4.Your range may not fit perfectly into these standard ranges. Choose the one that fits closest.
If your full range does not seem to fit obviously into a single voice type, use your tessitura instead to see which type it most closely aligns with. You want to pick the voice type in which you will be most comfortable singing.
So, if you, for instance, have a range of (D2)G2-F4(A4), you would most likely be a baritone, the most common voice type for men.

Press middle C (C4) on the keyboard.,
Sing the note, matching your pitch carefully.,
Play descending notes, matching your pitch each time.,
Play ascending notes starting from middle C, matching your pitch as before.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Find Your Singing Range1," Because it can play a relatively wide range of notes perfectly in tune, a piano (or an electric keyboard) is usually the most useful instrument for finding your vocal range. Start by pressing the note middle C (also called C4) on the keyboard. Note that you won't need to know how to play the piano to use this method of finding your vocal range.


If you're not familiar with the keys on a piano, middle C is the fourth C natural note counting from the left side of the keyboard. In other words, it is the fourth white key that is two the left of two black keys. Usually, this is right in the middle of the keyboard, under the manufacturer's name or logo.If you're not sure whether you're using the right note, consider using a digital middle C reference tone (which can be found on YouTube, etc.) to help you find it.;
, When you've found middle C, sing the note out loud. Use a good amount of air support — you don't have to belt the note, but you need to sing it (and all of the other notes in this exercise) strongly and confidently.


Starting at middle C is a good idea because it's contained in all of the traditional voice classes (i.e., bass, baritone, tenor, alto, soprano.) However, middle C falls at the top of a bass's vocal range and at the bottom of a soprano's, so if you have an exceptionally low or high voice, you may not be able to hit it.This is OK — simply start at a more comfortable note instead.

, Press the white key to the left of middle C. This note is called B3. If you can, sing this tone as you try to match your pitch to the piano's. Next, press the white key to the left of B3 (which is called A3) and repeat. Keep moving down the piano through G3, F3, and so on until you reach a note that you can't sing comfortably. The previous note is the bottom of your singing range.


For example, let's say that Sandy starts from middle C and reaches F3 (four notes below it) comfortably. However, when she tries to sing the next note, E3, her voice wavers and she can't produce a clear tone. This means that F3 is at the bottom of her vocal range.

, Next, return to middle C and simply go in the other direction. When you reach a note that's too high for you to sing clearly and comfortably, you'll know that the previous note marks the top of your vocal range.


Let's say that Sandy starts from middle C and reaches D5 (eight notes up — over a full octave) without any problems. When she tries to sing E5, she can't maintain her pitch. This means that D5 is at the top of her vocal range.

, Your singing range contains all the notes in between (and including) your highest note and your lowest note.


In our example, Sandy can sing from about an F3 to a D5. This means her vocal range makes her roughly a contralto — traditionally the lowest vocal category for women."

Find your vocal range.,
Find your tessitura.,
Learn to use the right singing technique.",How to Find Your Own Singing Voice1," This is the measure of octaves you can sing, from the lowest to the highest.You can find your range by singing scales, starting with the lowest note you can clearly sing and continuing until you aren't able to hit a higher note. There are 7 main voice types: soprano, mezzo-Soprano, alto, countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass.


Warm up by singing major scales starting with the middle C. Sing C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C and move up or down one half step for each new scale.Which scales can you sing most clearly? At what point does it become difficult to hit the notes? Take note of where you fall to determine what your voice type is.;
, Your tessitura is the range at which you are the most comfortable, and at which your voice sounds the most pleasant.Your vocal range might exceed your tessitura. You might be able to hit very high or very low notes, but there's a range of notes that your voice can produce with greater ease and more power. Finding this sweet spot will help you find your best singing voice.


What songs do you typically enjoy singing along to? If there are some that you love to belt out, chances are it's because you can feel that you sound good singing them. Pay attention to the notes in these songs.
With training, you may be able to expand the range of notes you can sing with great power., If you haven't been using the right technique, you might not even know what your voice truly sounds like. Using the right technique will help your voice sound clear and strong. Keep the following pointers in mind as you practice singing:


Have good posture. Stand up straight so you can breath more easily. Keep your neck upright but relaxed.
Speaking of breathing, make sure you're breathing from your diaphragm. Your stomach should expand when you breathe in and deflate as you breathe out. This gives you more control over your pitch.
Open the back of your throat and enunciate your vowels when you sing.

",How to Write a Great Christian Song," If you have a great idea already, then build off of that. Have an idea before you write the song; it will make it a lot easier!;
, Look up verses that resonate most with you. Can you see ways in which these will form a great basis for a song? By focusing on a Biblical passage or verse, you will improve the Christian content of the song and strengthen its value. This will keep it grounded in truth.

, You can listen to the sermon your preacher gives Sundays, and write about the topic he or she put forward. Try putting lines he or she emphasizes as the most important lines in your song. He or she may even be willing to help your song by reading what you've produced and make some suggestions.

, Will it tell a story? Will it illustrate a journey, or demonstrate a viewpoint?

, This will help you to connect best with the audience, by writing about how you are feeling. If you're sad write a slow, steady song. If you're happy write a more upbeat song. Every good songwriter has a mixture. And the audience will connect with that, relating it back to their own experiences.

, Can you create a bunch of mini-songs which can then be strung together to form the whole content of the song?

, If the verses added prevent the song from making good sense, move them around a bit. Shift in new ones and pull other ones out. Go back constantly to your theme or message decided earlier, to make sure the song is fitting well.

, Sing it or play it out loud, at its most basic. Is it coming across in the way you want it to? This process can be lengthy, so don't rush it. Give it plenty of time and focus on what you want the audience to understand from your song and its message.

Always warm up first.,

Perform for other people.",How to Find Your Own Singing Voice2," Your vocal cords are muscles that need time to warm up so they don't get overstrained. Start by singing scales slowly for about 10 or 15 minutes. When your vocal cords feel warmed up and ready to go, you can launch into singing your practice songs.

, Choose songs that easily falls into your range, so you'll give yourself the best chance of singing well and finding the great singing voice that's been hiding within you for all this time.


Sing along with the recordings of the songs you pick until you feel comfortable with the songs.

Find your natural range.,
Move through your normal range.,
Work up to difficult notes.,
Round vowel sounds.,
Transition to normal vowel sounds.,
Substitute words.,
Warm up before you sing.,
Breathe properly while singing.,
Adopt proper posture.,
Relax your muscles.",How to Expand Your Singing Voice Range," The easiest way to do this is to have a voice coach help you, but you can figure it out on your own. Start with a middle C on a keyboard. Play it and match it with your voice. Do this again with the next note down and continue until you reach a note you cannot sing without straining your vocal cords. This is the bottom of your range. Repeat this process going up in pitch to find the top of your range.Search online for videos of notes played up and down the keyboard if you don’t have access to a keyboard.;
, Start with your normal range. Repeat a simple sound such as “la,” moving up and down your range. Master that first, touching upon notes at the high and low end of the range. Don’t linger on notes that put a strain on your throat. Focus on staying relaxed and breathing properly. Perform scales at least eight to ten times a day in practice.Continue this range practice daily until you can hit the difficult notes eight to ten times in a session.

, Continue to use the scale exercise, attempting to sustain difficult notes for longer periods of time. Add in other exercises to loosen your vocal cords. Take a break whenever you feel uncomfortable. The more you reach these notes, the easier time you’ll have singing them without pain.One exercise you can add is slides. Sing a note. Instead of moving back and forth, stop at the next note. Do this for each note until you reach the end of your range.
Another exercise is to grunt. Grunt to shorten your vocal cords, then sing a short word like “mom” in a note in your range. Move up or down your range each time.

, Change the sounds of vowels during higher notes to put less pressure on your vocal cords. Try rounding your mouth into a loose oval shape as you speak a word such as “time.” Let your jaw drop and your tongue loosen. The “i” will take on an “ah” sound.This isn’t useful at the lower end of your range because your vocal cords are already shortened. Use scale practice exercises to reach those notes.

, At first you can try singing individual words at the top of your range. Sing the word out loud, keeping the vowel sound rounded. At the end of the word, allow your throat to open so the vowel sound ends in the normal pronunciation. For example, transition back from an “ah” sound in “time” to the normal long “i” sound. As long as the normal sound returns before the next consonant, the word will still sound right to listeners.As you practice singing songs, incorporate this vowel modification into words on high notes until it becomes second nature.

, When you stumble over a certain word at a tough note in the middle of a song, substitute it for a simpler word such as “noo.” Practice the song again with the substitution until you are comfortable enough hitting the note to put the original word back in.Vowel modification can be used in conjunction with word substitution, such as when substituting “thet” for “that.”

, You should always take the time to loosen your vocal cords before you start. This is necessary to reach notes on the edges of your range and avoid damaging your voice. Possible warm ups include performing trills, moving up and down your range with “me” or “oo” sounds, holding your mouth in an “o” and buzzing, and humming.For trills, place your lips together and make an “h” or “b” sound (lip trills) or place your tongue behind your upper teeth and make an “r” sound (tongue trills) as you move up and down your vocal range.
You should also repeat exercises when you are finished singing to cool down your vocal muscles.

, Expanding your range involves mastering the basics of singing. One of these techniques is proper breathing. Inhale deeply so the diaphragm muscle under your lungs pushes your stomach out. When you exhale to sing, bring your stomach slowly in so that you can sing longer and control your tone.Practice controlling your breath by breathing in for a set interval such as four seconds, holding for four seconds, then breathing out for four seconds. Increase the intervals as you practice.
Taking in and using too much air at once won’t help you sing higher notes. Take in a single deep breath at a time and give your vocal cords a constant airflow to avoid strain.

, Good posture also serves to enhance the airflow necessary to stretch your range. Plant your feet on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Allow your shoulders to relax as you straighten your back. Keep your head and neck up while singing. When you reach the notes on the outside of your range, remember to avoid tilting your head or stretching your neck.

, Many beginning singers are tempted to tighten their body and strain their vocal cords to extend their range, but this is dangerous. Instead, stand firm against the floor without feeling tense. Don’t raise your muscles towards your throat when you sing. Allow your tongue and throat to stay as loose as possible. This will reduce your strain and increase your airflow, helping you reach notes on the edges of your range.One way to practice staying loose when not singing is to stick your tongue out ten times, two to three times per day.

Have a basic knowledge of notes, time signature, rhythm, and pitch.,
Keep it simple.,
Put down the sticks.,
Tap out some quarter notes and say, (don't tap), a rhythm that pops into mind.,
Repeat last step until a fluent piece is written.,
Go through the cadence one measure at a time and think of a cool bassline.,
Go through both parts of the whole cadence and look for opportunities to work in rudiments, e.g.,
Go through once more and finalize those two parts.,
Begin the quints/quads part.,
Incorporate more than one drum.,
Ask a friend or a colleague who is experienced in writing cymbal literature to write a cymbal part to the cadence.,
Balance and regulate.,
Know where the most powerful parts are in the music.,
Most importantly, practice.",How to Write a Drum Cadence," These are the building blocks of your writing.;
, One set of four quarter notes played correctly can be much more effective than three or four measures of complex material.

, Often you'll find yourself in a haze of your own playing. Avoid these mistakes:


Forget. A long series of notes can be tricky to remember, especially when different rudiments are involved.
Overplay. Remember that a drum line is only as good as its weakest drummer, and if he/she cannot keep up, the entire drum cadence is weakened
Solo. This is flashy, fun, eye grabbing, and may reflect great skill, but often in solos, the tempo is lost and will sound horrible with the rest of the line. Save excessive showboating for I & E's.

, Do eight or nine counts then stop. Repeat those counts three or four times. Then, if you like it, write it.

, This is most likely your snare part.

, Sometimes ripples are nice, or even dynamic quarters. Steady quarters are another option. Sometimes only the offbeat will give a funky sound to the line. It all depends.

, paradiddles, flams, etc. These sometimes help dynamics on either hand or at different points. They are also more professional.

, Yes, it may be boring sounding now, but your quads/quints are going to spice up even the simplest of cadences.

, A general rule to follow is to make sure every accent on the snare and bass drums is hit by the quads on a different drum. For example, if the snare drum accents every other beat, make sure every other beat gets a different drum.

, Use all manner of rudiments, accents, and even make chords with different drums. Even clapping and hands playing are effective.

, Cymbals are much more than crashes and hi-hats. Sometimes even the most basic cymbal parts can add a completely different sound to your cadence. Ask a friend who plays cymbals about all the different sounds and techniques you can create with a pair of cymbals. You might be surprised.

, Do not let one section overpower the rest of the line.

, Emphasize them for every section.

, Nobody's first song was awesome. All people who write music had to start somewhere. Mistakes and experimentation are how you learn; they're how music develops.

Almost every country song is written around a ""hook,"" a phrase that is repeated several times in the song and is easily remembered, like ""Friends in Low Places."",
Listen closely to songs and note their structure.,
Start with simple chord progressions and write the lyrics around them.,
Most country songs follow simple structures.,
Good songs tell stories, so think of how the story progresses in your song.,
While it's hard to avoid the clichés common in country songs, do your best to come up with new ways of saying the relatively few things that most songs deal with: the pain over a broken love affair, the thrill of a new one, regret over a life wasted; the joy of partying, and so forth.

,
Use strong verbs and concrete images.,
Remember that good writing of all kinds conveys action.,
Write from experience, but not just from your own.,
Write down everything that comes to mind that might be used in a song or as a building point.",How to Write a Good Country Song," The hook comes early in the song, most often in the chorus, and it is repeated several times. Hooks are often plays on common expressions, as in ""Friends in Low Places"" or seeming contradictions, like ""This Life is Me."" When you hear a common phrase, twist it around to see if it makes for an interesting book. Tim McGraw's ""It's a Business Doing Pleasure With You"" is a recent example.;
, Get copies of the lyrics or write them out yourself to help you become familiar with how songs are structured. You'll begin to see patterns emerge and you'll learn how to apply them to your own compositions.

, If you don't play an instrument and have no musical background, you should probably find someone who does and collaborate with them. Words that look good on paper don't always fit neatly into a song structure and need some fine tuning with the music to make the lyrics work with the music and the harmony.

, Don't be afraid of using odd structures; some of the greatest country songs break the rules, but keep in mind that simplicity is the hallmark and the strength of most good country songs. Most songs follow the verse-verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus pattern or something similar, but don't be a slave to convention if you think you've got hold of something a little out of the ordinary that works. The great Hank Williams song, ""Cold, Cold Heart"" ignores the convention of having a chorus and has four verses instead of the usual three. Willie Nelson's ""Crazy"" is quite atypical in terms of harmonic structure.

, Even if it's just a ""slice of life"" story, it should paint a picture that describes what the narrator is experiencing.

,, Make every word work hard. Lots of songs are fewer than 100 words, so they've got to pack a lot of meaning.

, Vivid images trump the sentimental phrase every time. ""My truck's in a ditch, my boss fired me today, my wife left me for my best friend"" all conjure up images in the listener's mind. It's your lyric, but it's the listener's mental image, and that's what sticks with them and makes those images memorable. ""I love you, I need you, I want you"" doesn't do much for the imagination.

, Other people have experiences that make for great song lyrics. Learn the art of empathy, putting yourself in someone else's situation and imagining what it might feel like to have a child, lose a parent or a spouse, or break up with a lover.

, News articles, movies, books or something that someone says in a conversation all can inspire songs. A friend's story about how a rainstorm made him feel homesick inspired this article's sample song. Keep a pen and paper handy to scratch out ideas and squirrel them away.


For example, some songwriters have a system of organizing songs and ideas that files them according to their approximate stage of completion. They'll ""star"" them according to completion, subject to change as the song evolves. That is, they'll file those that are finished as ""Fives"" and the rest in descending order. ""Ones"" will usually be a line or two, and ""Fours"" will be songs that need a little more work to finish.

Load Songify onto your Android.",How to Use Auto Tune," AutoTune is a program designed to pitch-correct recorded vocal tracks. If you want to use AutoTune, you've got to have a computer with enough speed and space to run a basic recording package and install AutoTune software. Some packages are expensive, but include basically the same options for the beginner, so get one that's in your budget if you're just getting started. Good, user-friendly recording software includes:


Audacity
GarageBand
Pro-Tools;
, Obtain Auto Tune from its official website. Install the software. You can also browse for more simple packages, like the AutoTune EFX 3, which leaves off some of the more complicated features of the software, but is a good option if you're just looking to get a T-Pain effect on a song.


Antares isn't cheap, but it's the software the pros use. If you want to try it with a free trial, you can apply it to a few recordings and see if you're interested in making the purchase.
If you buy Antares, take the tutorial for more specific information and guidance on using it with your home recordings. It's complex and professional software, very versatile for home recording. Do your research.

, If you're going to record music, you need a good-quality USB mic and any other MIDI hardware you need to record the music you want to back your AutoTuned vocals.


Alternatively, if you want to alter the settings on pre-recorded tracks, all you need is an isolated vocal track to import into Audacity, or whatever software you're using, and add your effect.

, You can AutoTune a recording of a voice or any other sound. When you're just getting started, it's best to record a brief snippet of your voice to mess around with and get the software figured out.

, Unless you want to AutoTune the entire track (which would sound ridiculous), highlight the portion of the vocal track you'd like to tune and mute everything else.


You might copy over the vocal track into a new track so you can work on it separately, still saving the original recording to revert back to if you want.

, To do a basic AutoTune effect, all you've got to do is make sure the key is set correctly and choose a retuning threshold dial, selecting the amount of time you'd like to take between the note and the automatic correction. When you've selected the retune speed, select apply and the track will be AutoTuned automatically. This is the easiest way to get started, especially if you're going for the robot voice., It may ask you to select a key when you're starting a new file, or it may analyze the track you've already recorded and determine the key itself, depending on the application you're using. Make sure the key is set, or the AutoTune will sound all wonky.

, The threshold should be set low (at zero, if possible) to achieve the ""T-Pain effect."" If you want the AutoTune to sound obvious and robotic, set it so the AutoTune will minimize the amount of time between the note and the effect. If you want it to sound more natural, aim for somewhere between 50 and 80 milliseconds., In the AutoTune window, you can also select effects like ""humanize"" and ""natural vibrato,"" to make the recording sound cleaner and less tuned. Depending on what you're going for, you can play around with these settings until you get the desired effect., If you want to do more specific spot-checks and tune individual notes and fragments in a sound file, you need to use Pro Tools. This is commonly done on most commercial recordings to get the vocals to sound as natural, but as correct, as possible.Create two mono audio tracks of the vocals and route the outputs into two separate channels on the mix page of the main track, linking one to record to the other.
Open AutoTune and click off ""auto"" and switch over to the graph feature.
Highlight the individual sound waves you'd like to correct and bend them accordingly. AutoTune uses reference markers for the individual ""notes"" they identify as being correct, and you can manipulate the sound wave around them to get the desired effect.
When you've got the track where you like it, record it from one mono track into the other, and you've corrected your vocals.

, If you're not interested in making actual recordings but want to have some fun with Daft Punk vocals, you just need to use your phone. AutoTune gained fame after becoming notable on tracks by Cher, T-Pain, and other pop singers. T-Pain developed a mobile phone app that's widely available and fun to use as a novelty, though not good for use in more professional recordings.


Download the app and open it. When you sing into the mouthpiece of your phone, it works as an instant-AutoTuner, or really more like a vocoder. You can also record yourself and play it back, or you can sing along karaoke-style to T-Pain songs.

, StarMaker is a free app that combines karaoke with AutoTune. If you want to sound like a star on your favorite songs, it's a good option to try out. It works like a game, and you can earn tokens to purchase new songs, making it a good quality option for kids or adults who're interested in just singing along and having fun.

, Songify takes AutoTune one step farther. It takes bits of speech and any other records you have and turns them into songs, complete with backing tracks, pitch-correction, and music. Instant-pop songs. All you've got to do is upload the app and hit record, and it spits back a silly, but perfectly tuned, song.

Read the top number.,
Read the bottom number.,
Understand the time signature as a whole.,
Identify time signature symbols.",How to Work out a Time Signature1," A time signature contains two numbers and is written as a fraction. The top number represents the number of beats in one measure of music.Common top numbers include: 2, 3, 4, and 6.


For example, if the top number is “4”, then each measure consists of four beats. If the top number is “6”, then the measure consists of six beats.;
, In a time signature, the bottom number represents the type of note that receives the beat. Each type of note is assigned a specific number.


“1”: Whole note (the whole note is worth one beat)
“2”: Half note (the half note is worth one beat)
“4”: Quarter note (the quarter note is worth one beat)
“8”: Eighth note (the eighth note is worth one beat)
”16”: Sixteenth note (the sixteenth note is worth one beat), After you’ve viewed the top and bottom numbers independently, you can view the two numbers as a whole. Below are a view examples:


4/4: each bar has four beats and the quarter note is worth one beat.
3/4: each bar has three beats and the quarter note is worth one beat.
2/2: each bar has two beats and the half note is worth one beat.
6/8: each bar has six beats and the eighth note is worth one beat., Instead of numbers, sometimes the time signature is represented by a symbol. The letter “C” stands for common time and it is used to replace 4/4 time. The letter “C” with a slash through it stands for cut time and is used to replace 2/4 time."

Choose your subject matter.,
Write an arresting first line.,
Come up with a strong lyrical “hook.” Those in the music industry often stress the importance of an infectious ""hook"" to capture the audience's attention and draw them into the song.,
Brainstorm to come up with more lyrics.,
Keep the lyrics simple and easy to remember.,
Write more than you need, and pick the best bits.,
Use a familiar chord progression.,
Come up with a melodic hook.,
Synthesize the vocal melody and lyrics.,
Consider the song structure.,
Repeat the hook often.,
Focus on achieving high production quality.",How to Write a Catchy Song," Begin by asking: what do you feel inspired to write a song about? The most popular songs often have emotional content that is relatable and that resonates with the listeners' own experiences.;
, The first line is important because it introduces the subject you are writing about and establishes the mood of the song.It can also be an effective way of grabbing listeners' attention from the very first instance.
For example, Gloria Gaynor's hit ""I Will Survive"" starts with the line: ""At first I was afraid, I was petrified,"" which piques our interest the first time we hear it.We are left wanting to hear how the story will develop throughout the song.

, A hook is that magic combination of lyrics, melody and rhythm in a particular section of the song that makes it so appealing to listeners. In terms of lyrics, it refers to a memorable phrase that is repeated throughout the song. It is often found in the chorus, but not always.When writing your hook, listen for interesting phrases that pop up in every day life or in popular culture. Look at books, novels, films, slang, television programs for inspiration.Focus on emotion. A good hook should capture the emotional emphasis of the song. Make sure all the other lyrics in the song relate to it.
Build a foundation for the hook through the verses so that when it arrives, there is a sense of tension and release., Starting with a lyrical phrase that forms your hook, try brainstorming or doing word association exercises to come up with potential lyrics.


Write the hook in the middle of a page and write down further words and phrases that relate to it.
Free association. In this exercise, you relax your mind and don't try to actively think of polished lyrics. Instead, simply list the things that come into your mind when you think about the hook. It might seem pointless but if you look back over what you have written, you may find it contains some good phrases that you can use in your song lyrics.

, Musicologists have noticed that most popular catchy songs have a smaller number of words in them and feature simple lyrics.For example, children's songs and nursery rhymes which feature very few lyrics are frequently cited as archetypal catchy ""earworm"" songs. Think about Barney's ""I Love You, You Love Me"" as an example!You probably don't want to write a nursery rhyme per se, but the same principle applies. The most memorable lyrics are emotive, straight to the point, and contain simple language that can be understood by a mass audience. Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" is a good example of a song with a simple lyrical hook.

, After you have a hook or a chorus and couple of verses you have a pretty much complete first draft of a song. However, it is a good idea to keep writing to see if you can come up with something better than you already have. Then you can edit the lyrics down by picking out the very best lines to use in your song., Most popular songs are based on particular chord progressions, which underscore and intersect with the vocal melody. Many modern pop and rock songs use the same four chord progression, referred to in Roman numerals as I-V-vi-IV.Examples of songs using this progression include U2's ""With or Without You"" and The Beatles ""Let It Be.""While common chord progressions are important, you'll need to add something unexpected to make the next hit. Musicologists argue that it is the mix of the familiar and the unexpected that gives particular songs that ""earworm"" effect., Similar in principle to the lyrical hook, the melodic hook is usually located in the chorus of the song. It should be the catchiest part of the song.


Catchy melodies are not that easy to come by, you will probably have to try a few before you get one that feels right.
Make the hook stand out by giving it a slightly different musical structure to the rest of the song. If it stands out it is more likely to stick in the listener's memory.

, Make sure that your melody and lyrics fit together well. Think about rhythm, timing, subject matter and the general atmosphere of the song.


Matching the mood of the lyrics and the melody is important. Most catchy songs feature upbeat melodies but there are also beautiful melancholy melodies that capture people's attention.
Don't shoehorn your lyrics into the melody awkwardly. Both may need to be adapted slightly to achieve the right balance.

, Most popular songs follow an ABABCB song structure, where A is the verse, B is the chorus and C is the bridge.This structure is familiar and is easier for listeners to remember.

, To make a song stick in people's heads, repetition is key. If you have a catchy hook with a winning combination of lyrics and melody, repeat it several times throughout the song.


The hook may only constitute a five second fragment but that can be all it takes to get your song to stick in people's heads.

, Production quality is important, and high production quality will make a song more appealing to the mass market.


Invest in or borrow the necessary equipment. For example, a microphone and good quality musical instruments and amps are the minimum requirements.
Most popular music on the radio is produced using digital audio workstation software like ProTools or Ableton.While these programs are often expensive to buy, they also make it possible for many to achieve high quality song production without access to a professional studio."

Count in 4/4 time.,
Count in 2/2 time.,
Count in 6/8 time.",How to Work out a Time Signature2," When the time signature reads 4/4, each measure has four beats and the quarter note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 2 beats, the eighth note is worth ½ beat, and the sixteenth note is worth ¼ beat.


If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4.”
If the measure had one quarter note followed by six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2-&, 3-&, 4-&.” “&” represents a ½ beat.

, When the time signature reads 2/2, each measure receives two beats and the half note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth two beats, the quarter note is worth 1/2 beat, the eighth note is worth 1/4 beat, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/8 beat.


If the measure had two half notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2.”
If the measure had four quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&.” “&” represents a 1/2 beat.
If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-e-&-a, 2.” “e-&-a” represents a ¼ beat.

, When the time signature reads 6/8, each measure receives six beats and the eighth note is worth one beat. This means that the whole note is worth four beats, the half note is worth 4 beats, the quarter note is worth 2 beats, and the sixteenth note is worth 1/2 beat.


If the measure had six eighth notes, you would count the measure as “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.”
If the measure had 3 quarter notes, you would count the measure as “1-2, 3-4, 5-6.”.
If the measure had 4 sixteenth notes followed by one half note, you would count the measure as “1-&, 2-&, 3-4-5-6.” “&” represents a ½ beat.

Identify the beat of a song.,
Divide the beats into measures.,
When you listen to or sing Old McDonald, the emphasis falls on the words ""Old"" and ""had"".,
Count the beats per measure.,
Do your best to determine the bottom number.",How to Work out a Time Signature3," Every song has a beat, or a steady pulse. As you listen to the song, tap your toes or snap your fingers along to the beat.Let's use Old McDonald as an example. As you listen to or sing the song, you would tap your toes at the words ""Old"" + ""Mc"" + ""Don-"" + ""ald"" + ""Had"" + ""A"" + ""Farm"" ""(rest)"".
Remember, beats are grouped into measures. The time signature at the start of the piece determines how many beats appear in each measure and which type of note receives the beat. Sometimes a note falls on the beat, other times a rest lands on the beat., Measures, or bars, group beats together. Each measure contains the same number of beats. As you listen to the song, keep your ear tuned to the start of a new measure, or bar. This is usually indicated by a strong emphasis on a note (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | ). The emphasis is usually something you ""feel.""

,


""Old"" + ""Mc"" + ""Don-"" + ""ald"" | ""Had"" + ""A"" + ""Farm"" + ""(rest)"" |
On a musical score, a single vertical line separates one measure from another.
If the time signature changes in the middle of the song, the number of beats in each bar will change too., Once you've divided the beats into even measures, count the number of beats between each set of bars. This number will be the top number of the time signature.


In Old McDonald, there are four beats per measure.

, Figuring out the bottom number requires some guess work. Base your guess on the speed of the song's beats. If the beats seem slow, the bottom number is probably ""2"". If the beats seem fast, the bottom number is likely ""8"". If the beats seem to pass at a medium speed (60 beats per minute), the bottom number is probably ""4"".


In Old McDonald, the beats pass at a medium rate. The bottom number is ""4"".

Put your ballad to music (optional.)",How to Write a Ballad," A ballad is a poem or song that focuses on a specific story. Often, ballads are about love--either lost or found-- or about an event or interaction that says something about the human condition. They are thought of as romantic and are often tragic. Reading ballads by other writers can be very helpful when you are trying to come up with your own ballad.Traditional British ballads can be funny, tragic, or even satirical, often tackling themes like love, work, and death. Like newspapers, they are impersonal in tone – regardless of how sensational the story is.

British broadsides (so-called because of the paper they used to be printed on) are more topical (i.e. journalistic), addressing events and issues of the day. These are often told from a first-person perspective, have stereotypical characters, and aren't very objective.

North American ballads also deal with love, scandal, violence, and disaster and are often categorized by the groups who sing them, whether they be miners, sailors, or cowboys, Native Americans, etc. Classic North American ballads include “John Henry” and “Casey Jones.”, Ballads tell stories that often tackle themes like scandal, love, death, disaster, or even current events. They usually follow a clear, linear storyline, relying on plotted action (an unsettled situation, a climax, and a resolution) to build suspense. Since many tell (or retell) traditional stories that have been circulating for generations, you can also adapt a well-known tale to ballad form if you don’t wish to write one from complete scratch.


Often, the theme of the ballad will make us feel a certain way about our own lives. Tragic ballads that focus on lost love are meant to remind us to be grateful of the lives we lead and the love we experience., The topic can range from a significant historical event that affected thousands, to a small, personal moment you had in your own life. Once you have chosen a particular event or person(s) to focus on, do a bit of research so that you can pick which parts of the story you want to tell, and which are unnecessary for the advancement of the narrative and theme.

, Ballads use a narrative style known as “leaping and lingering” – that is, skipping over non-essential plot points so that more time can be spent on the interesting moments. To mimic this style, cut any unnecessary backstory, plot connections, or secondary details that distract from the plot of the story you've chosen.


Stagger Lee, the example ballad for this article, is a classic American blues ballad about the murder of Billy Lions at the hand of Stagger Lee, who overreacted when Billy knocked the hat from his head. Salacious stories like this usually make for very popular ballads.

, The opening line of a ballad is often the hardest to write, but it is also the most important, because it is what draws the reader or listener in and makes him or her feel like he/she a part of the story. Ballads often open with stock phrases such as the come-ye-all salutation. (Ex. “Come all ye maidens,” “Come all ye comrades,” etc.) Feel free to borrow this phrase to get your story going (and make your ballad more authentic to boot). If you don’t want to use a starter phrase, focus on introducing the reader to the story..



Mississippi John Hurt’s version of Stagger Lee jumps right into the action by opening with,Police officer, how can it be?


, Ballads typically have four-line verses, of which two or more rhyme. (Blues ballads, on the other hand, often have two rhyming lines followed by a third, independent line.) The easiest way to get started with the rhythm and rhyme is to complete the first verse however you like it, then use it as the basis for the rest of the lines in the verse (ex. keeping the length, rhythm, and end rhyme of each line more or less consistent).


An AA rhyme is when the first and second line rhyme.
AABB: The first two lines are a rhyming pair and the second two lines are a new rhyming pair.
ABAB: The first and third line rhyme and the second and fourth line rhyme.
ABCB: Only the second and fourth lines rhyme.
Example from Stagger Lee (the first three lines are AAB, which is the traditional blues ballad rhyme scheme.):Police officer, how can it be?
You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stagger Lee
That bad man, cruel Stagger Lee.


, Once again, the chorus is very flexible in ballad form. It can be one line that is repeated in every verse, two lines that are repeated every few verses, an entire verse, or even two verses back-to-back. Additionally, you can repeat the chorus verbatim or change it slightly each time for dramatic effect.


This version of Stagger Lee includes the chorus at the end of every verse (The chorus is That bad man, oh cruel Stagger Lee):Police officer, how can it be?
You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stagger LeeThat bad man, oh, cruel Stagger Lee


, Use a consistent meter (i.e. try to keep the same lyrical rhythm as you did in the first verse). The meter is basically the pattern of syllables in a song or poem. Most ballads use the same meter throughout the song, or the meter for the chorus may differ from that of the verses. This is what dictates the rhythm. This following Poem has 3 lines, other than typical 4-lined ballads. By extending the sentences to other lines, you will be able to see it morph into a poem looking ballad.


Billy de Lyon told Stagger Lee, ""Please don't take my life,
I got two little babies, and a darlin' lovin' wife.""
That bad man, oh, cruel Stagger Lee

, Once you have the verse style down, you just need to complete your story following the same structural guidelines you. Don't be a slave to that structure, though. If you need to vary the length of a line or even of a verse here and there, go ahead and do it, and if you want to deviate from your rhyme pattern feel free to do so if it will make your ballad better.


""What I care about you little babies, your darlin' lovin' wife?
You done stole my Stetson hat, I'm bound to take your life.""
That bad man, cruel Stagger Lee
“Boom-boom, boom-boom,” went the forty-four
When I spied Billy de Lyon, he was layin' down on the floor
That bad man, oh cruel Stagger Lee
""Gentlemen of the jury, what do you think of that?
Stagger Lee killed Billy de Lyon about a five-dollar Stetson hat.""
That bad man, oh, cruel Stagger Lee.
And all they gathered, hands way up high,
At twelve o'clock they killed him, they're all glad to see him die
That bad man, oh, cruel Stagger Lee

, In these cases, the rhyme scheme is often AAB (see above) or ABAC (where the two-line chorus occupies the second and fourth lines, B and C, of each verse).


Lines that ""go together"" should have roughly the same number of syllables and accented syllables.

, While this is the most common ballad form, occasionally you'll find a ballad with, say, 6 lines, or one with a varying number of lines per verse.


Note that there are cases where the rhythm or the cadence of the ballad is more important than the rhyme.

, Give yourself some time to focus on other things before coming back to edit the ballad. Clearing your head of the story and the rhythm will allow you to look at the ballad with new eyes when you begin editing.

, Perhaps you couldn't find the right rhyme, or there were just too many syllables and you didn't know how to get rid of them. See if you can fix them now. Cut out any unnecessary verses, leaving only what the story needs.

, Whether or not you plan to put your ballad to music, you should still read your poem out loud. Reading out loud will help you to locate parts of the poem that might sound awkward. If you trip over a verse, you will know that you will have to tweak the amount of syllables or rhyme also make sure you can sing it because most ballads were sung in the olden times.

, Don’t tell him or her anything about the story--see if she/he can pick up the plot and themes on his/her own. You want your audience to be able to understand what you’re trying to say. Ballads are not simply songs; they are stories that teach the audience life lessons.

, Many ballads get made into songs, though they are also lovely when left simply as a poem to be shared with others. If you have a musical ear, try putting your ballad to some music."

Once you've got some kind of storyline in your head, try to separate it into various themes or moods for different parts / scenes and WRITE THEM DOWN.,
Try to decide on specific styles, sets of chords or repeating sequences of notes or chords (technically called ""leitmotifs"") or sound effects to represent different things.,
Start writing lyrics and music around this framework you've built up.

",How to Write a Concept Album," Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"", ""The Wall"", and The Who's ""Tommy"" are musts for understanding the genre. You might also try listening to or watching some Broadway musicals - they're always working music around a story.;
, If you already write poetry or can play an instrument, you're already halfway there!

, What is important to you? Do you have a message you want to project to change society? Or have you got a vision of the future (or the past or present for that matter) that you want to turn into a story? Or do you just have a story to tell, plain and simple?

Learn about chord structure, chord progressions and harmony, and know how to place a chord appropriately in a musical sentence (one website is 8notes.com]).,
Sopranos: middle C to An octave and a sixth above

,
Altos: G below middle C to D a ninth above middle C

,
Tenors: C an octave below middle C to G a fifth above middle C

,
Basses: G an octave and four notes below middle C to middle C

,
Decide if you are writing a song with accompaniment (piano, chamber ensemble, orchestra) or without (a cappella).,
Decide on the voices that will be in your song.,
Now you're ready to start writing!,
Write a short five or six bar melody (keep it simple) and decide which voice part will sing it.

,
Next determine what chords will be placed where in the harmony voices.,
Now build the harmony in the other voices.,
Repeat the previous three steps until you have a substantial piece of music.

,
If you're writing music with a piano accompaniment, try thinking of a fresh approach: florid and free or static, rhythmically following the choir or not, or call-response style.,
Now its time to put the lyrics under the notes.,
And voila!",How to Write a Choir Song," A great way is to discover choral music and playing or analyzing the sheet music. Also, know the range of the voice parts you want to use. A guideline is;
,,,,, Know how to write for the accompaniment also.

, This step is critical because the voice setting determines how the chords are spaced and voiced, and because the voice setting sets the pitch range in which your melodies can exist. The most common arrangements are Soprano 1, Soprano 2, Alto (SSA) and Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass (SATB) but many other voice arrangements are used (TTBB, SSAATTBB etc.) or could be invented

, You could start any way you want. However, a base rule would be to get know your lyrics first. This way you can plan a pleasing structure and ""paint"" the words and sentences (e.g. tense chords on painful words, musical crescendos for emotional crescendos, or vice versa!). The following steps are merely exemplary:

,, Experiment, look at progressions in popular songs or classical pieces or use Roman numerals (most commonly used chords in the major key are I, IV, V. In the minor key i, iv, v, V.) like they use in music theory.

, Possibly using the Roman numeral chord symbols you placed earlier. Block chords are most commonly in this setting because of the sound character of the sung melodies.

,, Combine and try whatever you think works. Take another look at successful pieces if your inspiration dries out. You could even use the Roman numeral chords symbols in the melody line to determine the chords that will be used in the accompaniment. Then write the piano accompaniment using moving chords and block chords freely to compliment the choir's melody.

, The lyrics can be prepared beforehand or be made to fit existing music. You could choose to put one syllable per note, one syllable for a lot of notes or even a lot of syllable on one note, letting the singers pronounce them freely, to create a mesmerizing whisper effect (take a look at music by Eric Whitacre for effective use of effects. Remember: less is more).

, You're done! Just add the dynamics you have to have in the back of your mind at all times while writing and you have a solid piece of music! Take it to your church choir, or sing it in the shower. It's all yours to use freely as you wish. Feedback can be very useful in learning to write more idiomatically and enhance your creative prowess.

, Be able to play sing the whole way through (even if you are not a great singer/musician).

, This can be done prior to writing or even while writing but you need to know where you are going with the song (especially if you are going to have someone else play/sing) before proceeding.

, The point of the bridge is to make the song sound ""fuller"" and it's really supposed to ""sum up your song"". In reality, the bridge is usually a real stumbling block because sometimes it's like writing a whole other song.


This is known by several names, such as the breakdown or sometimes second chorus. Whatever you call it, it is the same.

, Many artists choose to add a third verse instead of a bridge - this can work, depending on the style of music. If you are writing something where most artists use a bridge, make one.


Pick one line from your song and sing it over some chords in your key - you will get it. If you can write a verse and then a chorus, the bridge should be no more than taking a break and coming back to it when it ""hits"" you. It takes a while to become a proficient song writer so be patient - you will finish that song, so don't waste any money producing it until it is done.

, Changing the key and the tempo in the middle of a song without notice can wreck a song. Its often hard to change the key from Ab major to C minor and drop the BPM (beats per minute) from 120 to 65 without feeling like the song is falling apart. Not to say it is impossible, but it is often tough especially for new song writers. For beginners, try to stick to the original key and the original timing as much as possible.


Go to your old material. Most writers (unless this is your first song) go to the piles of songs that didn't make it and the look for little hooklets and pieces to create a fantastic bridge (maybe you made one for a different song in a different key).
Remember why you are writing and how it makes you feel - is it about falling in love? Does that make your stomach feel like a truck whizzing by on the interstate? If so, you have your subject matter and sound to try to emulate.

, As mentioned, key and tempo are important. If you start on a G chord in the verses and you start on a C or a D in the bridge, you will be fine. If you change up the strum pattern, but keep the same bpm, you are fine. You can take a 6th or 7th chord as mentioned (these numbers refer to their position in the major scale 1 would be the root note 2 one step up - etc.).


If you don't have a war chest of songs, listen to the top 50 charts, look up the songs (Youtube works well). Play them, sing them, feel free to hate them but they have done the one thing you haven't yet––they are hits.

, A lot of bridges make themselves standout by hitting a note that is distinct from the rest of the song. A lot of artists will use something like the major/minor 6th or the major 7th note to transition their song to its bridge. This catches the listener's attention and adds a notable element to the song.

, Is the song really guitar heavy? Introduce the bridge with just the bass guitar playing. Is the vocally driven? Make the bridge an instrumental passage (no vocals). Try mixing and matching different instrument combinations and see what you want to build off of.

, If there hasn't been a lot of musical build in your song, try adding a distinct build. If the bridge breaks to just a single guitar playing, try slowly adding the other instruments back into what the guitar is doing until something new is built. It may leave room to add a new and inventive melody line.

, For example, instrumental, a capella, a drum interlude, and so forth. Try either a complementary style rock/country with blues or maybe even add a few lines of ""rap"".

, Writing an interesting song can be difficult. Finding the perfect bridge can be near impossible sometimes, but the more that you play with your song and the more fun you have with it, the more parts will stick out in your head and integrate into your music. Remember, there are no wrong answers in music.

Listening to music and learning to play it is the first step in learning to write a song, especially a good song. Learn to appreciate the wit and structure of a well-written song. If you want to be a good songwriter, be a good listener. Check out some of the masters:


Classic pop: Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller, Irving Berlin, Yip Harburg
Pop-Rock: Randy Newman, Paul McCartney, Carole King, Brian Wilson
Contemporary Pop and R&B: Michael Jackson, Max Martin, Linda Perry, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams
Country and folk: Townes Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, Kacey Musgraves, Hank Williams;
, Unless you're Mozart, it's tough to write a good song in your head, or just on paper. Most songwriters have a specific instrument they like to compose on, to hear the music as it is played.


Most pop songs are written on piano and guitar, while other types of music are commonly composed on other stringed instruments or horns. You can write a song on any instrument.
If you can't play an instrument, check out other articles to learn more about picking an instrument and learning to play.

, Choose a key signature, and find the related chords in that key. Then, play around with the order of the chords to find something you like.


Stick to a major key if you want to write a memorable song. Of the ten most popular songs of all time, only one is in a minor key.Lots of songs are written with the I-IV-V chords, which means the chord based on the first, fourth, and fifth note in the scale. So, in the key of C, the chords C, F, and G all sound good together. This is true of any key.

Learning the basic scales for the major keys in your instrument is really helpful in learning to write songs. Learning to read music can help you be a better songwriter, but it's not absolutely necessary. Simple pop songs are often written by untrained performers.

, Melodies won't be an exact copy of the chords in the scales, but will be based on those chords. Pick around the notes of each chord as you play to find a good melody, and explore the notes outside the chords but in the scale, as well.


To find a melody, lots of people like to hum along to the chords, or sing nonsense syllables or words to go along with the melody. Hum or whistle while you play, before there are lyrics., Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,"" and ""Gotta Give it Up"" by Marvin Gaye are all made of four chords or less. Most good songs are relatively simple, with a little quirk added to make it memorable. If you want to write a great song, it doesn't need to have five key signatures and fifteen time signatures thrown into the mix. Keep it as simple as possible.


Listen to John Lee Hooker play ""Boogie Chillun'"" and try to work out the chords. Give up? There's only one. The song is iconic because of the weird timing and rhythm, not the complexity of the melody or chords.
Listen to Marvin Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up"" and compare it to a simple 12-bar blues song. See how the switch up to the IV and V chords is delayed a few bars? That's the kind of twist we're talking about.

, When you're first starting out, learn lots of different songs and borrow the basic chord structures, but play them at a different rhythm, different tempo, and with different timing. Write different melodies to the basic chords. This isn't plagiarism, it's songwriting.


Learn a chord progression and then play it backwards and write a new melody. ""Whole Lotta Love"" backwards could be your new opus.
Take all the chords from your favorite song and just play them in a different order until you find something you like.
Lots of songs sound like other songs. It's not a bad thing. As long as you're not doing a straight-up copy of the rhythm and timing and melody all together, you're still writing a new song.

, When you've got a basic melody that you like, keep playing it to yourself and letting your mind wander. What kind of mood does the melody have? What does the song remind you of? Start brainstorming possible lyric topics.


If you've written a whimsical or melancholy song, start thinking of images. What does the song remind you of? Who does it remind you of? What do you picture when you think of the song? Just start brainstorming on paper.
Think of stories, think of characters, think of places, think of moods. Start writing little fragments and lines that illustrate those ideas.
Alternatively, find a subject that complements the melody in a strange or interesting way. Warren Zevon's ""Excitable Boy"" sounds like an upbeat piano ballad, even though the lyrics are about a deranged serial killer.

, Once you've got your theme or subject in mind, write out a few lines that you think are good to start building around. You can start with a chorus line that makes the theme or subject obvious, or just start writing the verses and find the chorus later.


Think of a powerful image or detail to start with: ""Pistol shots rang out"" starts Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane,"" about a man falsely accused of murder."" Or the iconic start to ""Long Black Veil"": ""Ten years ago on a cold dark night / Someone was killed beneath the town hall light.""
It's also fine to just start sketching and free associating words. Because you'll eventually pair this with a melody, good lyrics don't have to make a whole lot of sense: ""Wounded lover, got no time on hand / One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam"" as the Rolling Stones put it.

, There are lots of different ways to approach the chorus and make it fit the song, but usually you want the chorus to be the part where the theme or the subject is summed up in a tidy little phrase or sentence that sounds good to the ear. You might try writing for a while around a couple verses, then pick one that stands out to you as being the best to repeat, or try to write a chorus separately. Here are some good ones:


""A few good federales say they could have had him any day / They only let him slip away out of kindness, I suppose"" from ""Pancho and Lefty"" by Townes Van Zandt
""How does it feel to be on your own / With no direction home / Like a complete unknown / Like a rolling stone"" from ""Like a Rolling Stone"" by Bob Dylan
""Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be / Whisper words of wisdom, let it be"" from ""Let it Be"" by the Beatles
""Go, Johnny go! Go, Johnny go! Go, Johnny, go, go, go / Johnny B. Goode"" from ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry

, The hardest part about writing a good song is finding the right lyrics to match up with it. Most song lyrics include rhyming end words, but all songs don't have to rhyme. Learn a little about how to rhyme properly to get your song lyrics to match up with the music.


Most lyrics aren't formally structured into a rhyme scheme, but it depends on the song. An ABAB rhyme-scheme might be perfect for the song you wrote.
Avoid cliches. Just because words rhyme doesn't make them good for your song. If the rhymes seem obvious (""I love my baby / I don't mean maybe"") it's best to look for something else.

, Many beginner lyricists write lyrics full of abstract ideas and not specific images. Give us something to see, don't tell us things. Avoid big concepts like ""time"" or ""love"" or ""depression"" in your lyrics, as well as mixed metaphors. If you're writing, ""The bleak rage of my depression / Time is like a lesson"" then try to make your lyrics more specific.


If you tend to write in abstractions, write out your big abstracts and describe what specifically they make you think of. What does the ""bleak rage of your depression"" look like? Sitting alone at three am, drinking coffee? Stabbing out a cigarette into an ashtray already overfull? That's better.

, Use as few words as possible in your lyrics. Make them count. Unlike a poem, you don't have to fill your lines to the brim, because you'll have the addition of music. Use as simple a structure as possible in your lyric-writing.


Look at the lyrics to a song you really like. Without the song, they probably won't look that great, but they'll probably be simple and specific. Do the same with your song.
Keep revising words away from your lines as you try to sing them. If something gets stuck in the mouth, figure out a way to sing the song without it.

, Lots of songs are written in pairs. Jagger-Richards. Lennon-McCartney. Leiber-Stoller. If you've got a handle on the music-end of things, consider enlisting a lyric-writing partner to help give you a new perspective. If you're a better lyricist, hook up with someone who's a whiz with melodies.


Lots of performers, from Elton John to Elvis, didn't actually write most of their own material on their own. Writing with a partner is a long-proven effective technique.

, Songs can be structured in lots of different ways. A basic song-structure, though, will consist primarily of alternating verses and choruses. The verses will usually change, while the chorus generally remains constant in most songs.


Choruses are usually the ""hook"" of the song. What's the part of the song that gets stuck in your head? What's memorable? That's the chorus. Repeat it at least three times to make the song memorable.
A verse will usually, but not always, start the song. This allows you to build up to the chorus, which is usually the most catchy or memorable part of the song.
Some songs have no chorus at all. Lots of rap songs, for example, are just flow. Some songs, like Bob Dylan's ""Desolation Row"" are just long verses, which all end on the same phrase, though there's not a typical chorus.

, Bridges are a one-time variation of the chorus structure in the song, which happens about three-fourths of the way through the song, between a chorus and a verse, or between two choruses. It's just a way of shaking up the song.


In some kinds of music, like metal songs and high-energy dance songs, a breakdown is more appropriate than a bridge. This usually involves cutting everything but the drums and some vocals for a few bars, to get people moving.
Often, bridges involve a switch into the minor key for a few bars.

, Just because you've got a melody and rhyming words doesn't mean you've got a song yet. Learning to fine-tune the song by working out the phrasing is essential to writing a good song. Keep working on your song, singing it to yourself repeatedly, to learn how the melody can be adjusted in the voice, and how the lyrics can be tweaked.


Even if you're not a great singer, it's important to sing the song as the songwriter. Find a place where nobody will hear you, if you're sheepish about your voice. Belt it like Beyonce.

, Songs are meant to be heard. It can be very helpful for aspiring songwriters to get feedback on their material, especially from other songwriters or musicians who appreciate music.


Playing a song for your family or close friends who aren't music listeners will usually not be that helpful. They'll usually just say, ""I love it! Great job!"" That can be good to hear, but if you want to write a great song, seek out songwriters for feedback.
Record it and listen back to it yourself, if you're too embarrassed to play your song for someone yet. Listen to how it sounds. What could be better?

, Bob Dylan claims to have written ""Blowin' in the Wind"" in fifteen minutes, while Leonard Cohen claims to have never been fully satisfied with ""Famous Blue Raincoat,"" even though the song is 40 years old.Don't stop working on a song. Keep hammering out the little details until it comes into shape. If you want a song to be good, it's not enough to be able to sing it.

, Don't even think about the fact that you're trying to write a song. Base your poetry on something that's happened to you. Depending on the genre, you can decide if you want to describe an emotion, tell a story, or just write something down. Or if you're writing your song as a gift, take some time to think about that person and your history together.

, Pick out a particular phrase that grabs your attention. Turn this into a chorus. It is usually easier to make the chorus then the other parts, if it catches your attention it will to other people.

, Is there going to be one chorus or four? Where do they go? Try reading your poem out loud and notice where you pause or breath. These are usually good places to break. Then put in the chorus.

, Erase the parts that you think are too long or don't fit in a song. In each song there is a beat and if you have a long line in your poem and just try to squish it in, it won't sound nice. If you really liked the line, then try to think of another, shorter way of saying it.

Draw patterns: Children often take great interest and pay special attention to drawing activities.,
Use toys and play.You can employ the use of many useful instruments such as building blocks, puzzles, mazes, and booklets etc.",How to Teach Nursery Rhymes to Kids," The first key to teaching a nursery rhyme is to expose them to it, a lot! Be prepared to be silly and goofy with them. Sing it to them when they're young and you're getting them to sleep or changing their diapers. Sing along with them once they're older, in their car seat or while they're playing. Be prepared to rhyme and sing until the tunes and words are just naturally drilled into them.;
, Memorizing anything requires patience. Nursery rhymes should be fun, not a taxing chore. Your child may mix up the words, sing the wrong tune, or even get creative and sing the wrong rhyme on purpose; this is perfectly okay, and you must remain patient.


If you feel any deficiency in your child’s progress, sing the same poem to them, during play and other relaxing activities, again and again. Understand that the repetitive quality of nursery rhyme phrases helps in memorizing them.

, Avoid a monotone voice. You must be cheerful when teaching nursery rhymes and this should be heard in your voice. Encourage them to do the same, i.e. repeat the rhymes after you in a fun and rhythmic tone.


Use hand gestures if you want to This will add creativity, cognitive abilities, improves hand to eye coordination and encourages thinking.

, Use this natural skill of every child to your great advantage. After you teach about a certain nursery rhyme today, ask questions about it tomorrow before starting the next rhyme. For instance, you can ask questions like “Where was Humpty Dumpty sitting?”, “Why couldn’t the soldiers fix him?”. This is the quickest way to get them to memorize a rhyme and it works faster if you give little prizes for every right answer.

, Use this to your advantage by helping them learn a vast number of nursery rhymes. You can engage yourself in this activity with your child by drawing a character from a certain rhyme you wish to get your child memorized.


For instance, you can sing together ‘Humpty Dumpty’ with your child and then draw Humpty on a paper and ask your child to identify it and relate to that rhyme. This activity will greatly enhance the memory and association skills.

, each having its own advantage. Ask your child to build a wall from which Humpty fell, finish the puzzle diagram of a scene from ‘Johnny Johnny Yes Papa’ and so on. This will greatly enhance memory, reasoning, association and problem solving in the child.

Sit or stand up straight with your muscles relaxed.,
Breathe from your diaphragm.,
Warm up before starting to sing.,
Start with songs that are in your vocal range.,
Practice scales, gradually increasing the pitch each time.,
Train your body to hit the high notes.,
Always remember to not strain your voice.,
Improve your posture.,
Get in shape.,
Develop facial flexibility.",How to Develop a Strong High Singing Voice," Keeping your back straight and your posture neutral will allow your diaphragm and lungs to expand properly as well as encourage air flow. Since your singing power originates in the diaphragm, making a point of relaxing the rest of the body will help you refocus your attention on the parts of the body that matter.


Make a special effort to relax your stomach. Resist the urge to hold or suck it in, as this will make your breathing unnatural.
Using your thumb, push the larynx from side to side gently, allowing your vocal chords to loosen, thereby putting less stress on them when you begin to sing.

, The diaphragm is a muscle beneath the lungs that contracts whenever you breathe in, allowing your lungs to expand into that space. Expelling air is therefore a question of allowing the diaphragm to relax in controlled, gradual manner. To test what it feels like to breathe through your diaphragm, bend over at the waist and sing. Notice the feeling in your stomach and the sound that you create.


Don't ever breathe in through your nose; it will make it harder to reach high notes.

, Make nonsense sounds (ex. expelling air to forcibly flap your lips by and create a b-b-b-b-b or p-p-p-p-p sound, making a prolonged ""shhhhh"" sound, and so on), covering different consonants and vowels to engage different facial muscles. This produces a richer, less strained sound. (When you blow up a balloon, it is much easier to stretch the balloon before blowing it up; your vocal chords function in much the same way.)

, Covering territory you're already comfortable with will continue to warm up your voice before you try to train it to do anything new. Consider choosing a song that has a few notes slightly above your usual range and make these your goal.

, Remember that your vocal chords are delicate membranes and must be eased into any new techniques.

, As you sing the note, press your lower belly in but keep your upper belly out; this is called a “lower belly boost.” Drop your lower jaw dramatically but keep your mouth opened narrowly. Bend your knees slightly to make yourself feel like you're moving downwards as your voice goes up. Try to minimize the height to which you lift your larynx up as you increase your pitch; though this is what people naturally do when raising their voices, this strains your throat and can cause your voice to crack. Monitor this by placing your fingers above your larynx while you sing and adjusting your technique to keep the larynx down.


Don’t look up while you sing high notes; keep your vision directly in front of you to avoid bending your throat and straining the sound.
Sticking your tongue forward may help give the high notes a richer sound.

, Don't try to force yourself into a much higher register too quickly; there are often serious consequences when you do. Remember to always drink water before a performance or practice, which will keep your voice steady. Keep one near you for emergencies as well.

, To strengthen your singing voice, make good posture a habit, not a mode you switch into.;
, Take up running or practise interval training to increase your lung strength and capacity.

, Make funny faces, stretch your mouth and tongue in all directions, yawn to open the back of the throat, and loosen your jaw until you're able to push or pull on it with your hand. These exercises will help you shape and perfect the sound as it comes out of your mouth.

Stand up straight.,
Relax your body.,
Keep your chin parallel to the ground.",How to Develop the Proper Posture for Singing1," Imagine lengthening your body through each vertebrae in your spine. Point your tailbone towards the ground and the crown of your head towards to sky. As you point your tailbone down you will need to align your body by shifting your pelvis slightly forward.Practice the proper alignment of your body by standing against a wall. Your head, shoulders, hips, and heels should all touch the wall.;
, As you lengthen your body, don’t forget to relax. It is not uncommon for your body to naturally tense up as you stand up straight. Relaxing your body will allow your diaphragm to expand and enable you to take a deeper breath.If you find that your body is too tense, try shaking out your body and then regaining your singing posture. If you are having a hard time relaxing, you can also try progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a systematic relaxation technique that enables you to relax each part of your body.

, Your ears should be over your shoulders and the crown of your head should be pointed at the ceiling. This position will allow the maximum amount of air to flow in and out of your abdomen.Holding your chin too high can cause your vocal cords and tongue to be stretched too tight.
Holding your chin too low can obstruct your airway.

Rotate your shoulders to the back and down.,
Hold your chest high.,
Tighten and relax your core.,
Place your arms by your sides.",How to Develop the Proper Posture for Singing2," In a circle, rotate your shoulders forward, up, and then back. Keep your shoulders in the back position. Relax them so that they are slanted down., When your shoulders are slightly back, you will find that your chest naturally rises. Holding your chest high will create more room for your diaphragm to expand. Do not strain or puff out your chest., When you are breathing in, your core should be relaxed in order to expand to accommodate the air that you are taking into your body. Your core will tighten as you slowly release this air to project your voice.


Test your breath ability by placing your hand on your belly. Take a deep breath in. Focus on breathing into your hand by expanding your belly. Do not raise your shoulders when you breathe.

, Your arms should be to each side of your body. Keep them relaxed and not rigid. Your hands should be slightly away from your body. Remember to also relax your hands and your fingers.Wiggle your fingers and wrists when you feel like you are too stiff.

Locking your knees can interfere with circulation, causing you to become dizzy or lightheaded., You will want to stand with your feet apart but not too far apart. Aim to keep your feet under your shoulders. You can also put one foot slightly in front of the other foot in order to keep your balance., With one foot slightly in front of the other foot, shift your weight so that you are putting more weight on the balls of your feet. Shifting your weight to your heels will naturally cause you to lock your knees. Don’t lean too far forward as you will lose your balance., Then, try singing again in a slouched posture. You should notice that you are able to project your voice much better when your body is in a good singing posture. Don’t worry if it feels foreign or uncomfortable. You will get used to this new posture with time.

However, if you only want to practice once a month you may be able to afford a more expensive vocal teacher.;
, Most beginner lessons are 30 minutes and cost anywhere between $10-35, while more in-depth lessons are anywhere between 45 to 60 minutes and can cost upwards of $100. Depending on your skill level and what you want to accomplish, the length of your lessons may vary, which will affect how much you pay. For example, if you are simply looking for some techniques to help keep your voice healthy, a lesson for you might be much shorter than one for someone who is looking to perfect their tone or learn a new singing style.

, The more experience and training a vocal teacher has, the more likely they are to be expensive. So it’s important to know what you are looking for in a lesson.


For example, if you just want some basic training to improve the sound of your voice, a novice teacher or a music education major might be enough. However, if you’re looking to make singing a career, you are probably going to want a more experienced teacher who is more capable of analyzing your voice and catering lessons to your particular needs. , When taking vocal lessons you may be required to purchase materials like music books or sheet music, which can cost anywhere between $50-150. You may also be asked to take part in recitals or competitions, which may charge a fee on top of any money you spend traveling to and from them., Deciding how much you are willing to pay before you search for a vocal teacher will not only help you filter out teachers who are outside your price range but also help you plan for additional or unexpected costs. To set your budget, consider your maximum price and then factor in lessons and all other necessities.


For example, if you have $100 a month to spare you might want to find a vocal teacher between $10-$20 per week. This way you can have some extra spending room for things like music books or competitions.

, This can be a local music school teacher, a teacher at a music store, or even a church choir director. Since vocal training is not their primary job, these people are more likely to charge less for lessons. Working with someone in the immediate area will also help you save on gas money.


When contacting a local music teacher, try emailing or calling them first. Simply introduce yourself and say something like, “I am searching for information on singing lessons,” or “I am looking to take singing lessons and was wondering if you had any information that could help me.”
Even if none of these people can teach you directly, they may know of someone else who can help you.

, Local universities and community colleges are great places to search for inexpensive music instructors as there are many music education majors that may teach at a discount. Since they are still learning themselves, they are unlikely to charge you the same fees as a professional coach. Depending on how far along they are in school, they may charge you even less.


For example, a freshman music education major is likely to be more inexpensive than a senior music education major.
In the flier you should include your phone number, vocal ability (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), schedule/availability, the price you are willing to pay, and preferred style of music (i.e. hip hop, classical, jazz, opera, pop).
Don't give out your name or address. You don’t know who is viewing your fliers, so it’s safer to keep this personal information to yourself.

, There are many part-time or novice teachers that utilize craigslist and the classifieds to search for students. Since they may be new to teaching, or without a set pool of clientele, they are more likely to teach at a lower price.


For Craigslist, check under ‘Services’ for a vocal coach, or simply use the search bar to simplify the process.
Make sure you do not give out your address until you have spoken with your potential teacher and seen their resume.
Also make sure you meet in a public place and that someone else knows where you are going.

, Similar to putting up a flier, this will allow potential teachers to find and contact you. It also allows you to set your price beforehand, so the teachers that contact you are more likely to be in your price range. When placing an ad, follow the same rules for a flier and include:


Your phone number, vocal ability (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), schedule/availability, the price you are willing to pay, and preferred style of music (i.e. hip hop, classical, jazz, opera, pop).
Make sure you get your potential teacher’s credentials and information beforehand. An easy way to do this is to request a resume in your ad.
Meet in a public place. This way you don’t have to give your address and they don’t have to give theirs. It will make both parties feel safer.

, There are many online resources for vocal lessons with instructional videos and direct feedback from trained teachers or former singers. Since these are online and do not require either party to meet in person or follow a set schedule, prices may be lower. Some sites may even offer a flat rate if you pay for bulk lessons. For example, $150 for a three-month plan that offers access to all online lessons.You may also be able to find online training videos for free. However, you should try to find the credentials of the poster before you follow any of the lessons in the video.

, Searching a site like Yelp, which has a multitude of user-based reviews, is a good way to find not only the best vocal teachers in your area but teachers who are in your price range. Making a list and emailing these teachers will allow you to speak with them about schedule flexibility and cost without any hassle.


You don’t need to send all your information at once. When sending a query, you can write something like, “Hi, my name is __________ and I saw your name on Yelp. I am currently searching for a vocal teacher and was hoping to speak with you about your schedule and pricing.”

, If you still can’t find a teacher within your price range, dividing the time and cost of a single lesson with a friend or family member might be the way to go. Make sure to discuss this idea with your potential teacher beforehand so they can help you figure out how to split the price and lesson. Some vocal teachers may also teach you both at the same time if you have the same ability.


For example, if you’re both beginners, you will likely need training on the same things.

Warm up your voice.,
Tense your neck while singing.,
Imitate a coughing sound for lower range vocals.,
Use your saliva.,
Hire a vocal coach.,
Use technology.",How to Develop a Slightly Raspy Singing Voice1," Before you attempt to sing in a slightly raspy voice, you should warm up appropriately. Try starting with breathing exercises, and then move on to scales. After that you can continue warming up with trills and hums.;
, A raspy sound occurs when there is incomplete contact between vocal chords. You can get a raspy singing voice by tensing your neck and exuding a lot of air as you sing. This will prevent your vocal chords from coming into complete contact and result in a slightly raspy singing voice.It is okay to sing or record a couple of songs with this technique, but you should not sing or record an entire album or concert as this can cause long-term damage to your vocal chords.

, If you are singing near the bottom of your vocal range, you can combine your singing voice with the edginess of a cough. Try coughing a few times. Notice the grinding deep in your throat that is responsible for the cough. Now recreate this grinding as you sing., One way to produce a raspy voice is to create a significant amount of saliva and/or phlegm in the back of your throat.Then begin singing in a growl-like voice. Tighten the muscles in your throat just enough so that the airflow is restricted by the phlegm. Your throat should feel like it does when you make a low-pitched growling noise., Singing in a slightly raspy voice can damage your vocal chords. To ensure you don’t end up with long-term damage, you should enlist the help of a professional that can guide your explorations in raspy singing. Research vocal coaches in your area, ask them about their teaching methodologies, and set up an initial voice lesson., You don’t need to ruin your voice to get that slightly raspy sound you’re looking for. Try using technology instead. For example, you can record a song in your normal voice and then have an audio engineer augment the recording so that your voice sounds raspy. This will protect your vocal chords while giving you the raspy recording you desire."
"
Understand you can damage your vocal chords.,
Know when to stop.,
Sing within your vocal range.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Develop a Slightly Raspy Singing Voice2," Singing in a raspy voice can cause long-term damage to your vocal chords. This is especially true if you are singing in a raspy voice, which can strain your vocal chords. Voice problems like vocal nodules and vocal polyps can develop if you abuse or overuse your voice., It is important that you keep your vocal chords safe when you are trying to develop a slightly raspy singing voice. If your throat is sore or dry, you should not sing. You should also stop singing in a raspy voice if your voice seems fatigued.You can remedy a dry throat by drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day, resting your voice, and drinking warm water with lemon.

, Using the extremes of your vocal range, such as singing too high or too loudly, can put your vocal chords at risk. This is also true if you attempt to sing too low or too softly. Instead, sing within your natural range., Making sure your body is hydrated is an important part of singing safely. Be sure to drink eight glasses of water each day. Limit your consumption of alcohol and caffeine as both can dry out and irritate your vocal chords. You can also use a humidifier in your home."

Learn some basics about composing and music theory.,
Learn some time signatures.,
Learn the key signatures.,
Now, let's start composing.,
Experiment.,
Sequence music that's not yours, but is well-known.,
If you don't know what to compose, just click random notes.",How to Sequence Midis With Anvil Studio," You should know the basic names of notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and their flats/sharps). Now, there are several types of notes. Standard notes are quarter notes (filled circles with lines). They equal to one beat. Eighths notes (filled circles with line with tail) are smaller. Two eighth notes equal one beat, or quarter note. Sixteenth notes (filled circles with lines with two tails) are even shorter. Four 16th notes equal to one beat. Thirty-Second notes (filled circles with lines with three tails) are the smallest notes used in compositions. Anvil Studio gives you ability to use 64th notes, but officially, 32nd notes are shortest. 8 32nd notes equal one beat. There are also Half notes (hollow circles with lines), that are bigger than quarter notes. One half note equals 2 beats, or quarter notes. And, the longest note is whole note (a hollow circle with no lines, or tails), that equals 4 beats. There are also notes in between these notes. If you add a dot to any note, it adds half of a count to it. For example, dotted eighth note equals to eight note + sixteenth note in one note. Dotted quarter note equals to quarter note plus eighth note in one note. Dotted half note equals to three beats, or quarter notes.;
, Time signatures are usually written at the beginning of compositions and in places where they change. The number on the bottom indicates the type of beat, while the number on the top indicates the number of beats. A very simple time signature is 2/4; this has two quarter note beats per bar. The longest possible note here is a half note. A bar of 3/4 consists of 3 quarter note beats. 4/4 is known as ""common time"". A less simple time signature is 6/8, which contains six eighth notes. In length, it is equivalent to 3/4 (mathematically, 6/8 reduces to 3/4), but it is counted differently: 6/8 consists of two dotted crotchet beats (or two beats consisting of three eighth notes), while a 3/4 bar contains three quarter note beats . Irregular time signatures may also be used, for example, 5/4, 7/4 and 11/8, although these are less common. Anvil Studio allows you to enter custom time signatures, should the need arise.

, Key signature (number of flats and sharps) is written right before the time signature. It decides the key that the piece is written in. There just as much keys as there are notes. Flats and sharps also might be used in the middle of the piece. Sometimes, in minors, sharps and flats make the piece sound harmonic/melodic, while in majors, they sound minor and harmonic.

, Open up anvil studio and create new track (if it isn't created already). Name it ""melody"" and leave instrument piano. Think of a cool melody in your head. Once you've got it, sing it. As you sing, count. Tap your foot and count in your head. Counting during singing helps you determine what type of notes they are so you can record them. If the note does not fit the count, subdivide quarter beats into eighth/sixteenth/thirty-second beats. Be sure to record each bar as you go on. Record about about 4-5 bars. Now, play your melody. Make adjustments, if it doesn't sound right. Now, make another track named ""Sub-melody"". Leave the instrument piano for now. Record same melody, except for bring the notes down by 2 (so, if the first note of the melody is E, first note of the sub-melody will be C). Play the melody. If you did everything right, your music should sound really cool. Now, create third track. Name it ""bass"". Add lower half notes (if you are in 4/4) that go with the melody (even though you wrote the melody in one key, it still changes key as different notes are played. Those keys go with the original keys. Do not change key signature, though). After you added bass melody, play the piece again. Make adjustments, as you go on. Now, click the instrument of ""melody"" and change it to some other instrument. Change instrument to whatever fits your style. Rock pieces should have lead instrument as distortion guitar, sub-melody as any other type of electric guitar and bass as any electric bass. Brass pieces should have melody in trumpet, sub-melody in trombone and bass in tuba. Orchestras should have melody in violin, sub-melody in viola and bass in... bass (or Contra-Bass). Think of other instrument combination. You might also want to add percussion. Just add beats in different drums that go with the rhythm.

, Combine different instruments. Work with percussion. Discover new ways to bond notes. Read some music theory books. As you practice more in composing, you'll get better. I also suggest you learn how to play piano (or any other instrument). That develops your musical hearing and will help you with the next step.

, You can make it for game, or just for fun. To do that, first get the original song. Listen to it couple times. Then, listen to first 10 seconds. Try to discover the time signature by counting and watching patterns (if you have musical hearing, that should be fairly easy). Now, match the first note of the song so you're in the right key. After you do that, use your musical hearing and newly discovered note lengths (that were found thanks to counting) to compose first 10 seconds of melody. Then, listen to first 10 secs again and try to catch sub-melody and bass. Listen, until you recognize all the instruments and melody. Use same method to continue through entire song. Be sure to play the song often and make adjustments.

, Random note-lengths. Random key and time signatures. Then, play your song. It, probably, will sound really bad, but you might be able to catch a unique melody. Make adjustments to make it sound more cooler and make the melody stick out. Then, add sub-melody, bass, percussion and any other instruments.

Place one hand on your lower back and one on your abdomen.,
Inhale by filling your lower lungs with air.,
Exhale by allowing your stomach to contract.,
Do not move your chest.",How to Breathe Properly for Singing1," Before you even begin to sing or practice breathing, place your hands on your back and abdomen, near waist-level. This will help you feel your body’s movement as you inhale and exhale deeply. You will feel your body expand as you breathe in and contract as you breathe out., As you inhale with a deep breath, visualize yourself filling the lower portion of your lungs with air. This will feel different from your normal breathing because our relaxed, daily breathing is usually quite shallow. As you breathe in, your hands on your back and abdoment should move outward.It may help to visualize yourself filling your stomach with air, as it if is a balloon.

, As you exhale, try to exhale all of the air in your lungs, so that the next time you inhale, you will be starting with all new air. Imagine that your stomach is a balloon and you are deflating it. Your abdomen will contract at this point, moving your hands inward., As you breathe, do not allow your chest to move. Your chest and shoulders normally move up and down in your daily breathing, but when you are singing, you will want to always breathe from the deepest part of your lungs. When you are breathing from the lower part of your lungs (your diaphragm), your chest should very little, if at all.Focus on breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Breathing horizontally means that your diaphragm and abdoment should move outward instead of the usual up-and-down movement that accompanies shallower breathing.

Belt out a single note.,
Drink at least six glasses of water a day.,
Practice saying tongue-twisters, and then put them to music.",How to Enhance Your Singing," In order to do so, take a deep breath, but keep your shoulders at the same level as before. You might not get the hang of it at first, but with practice this exercise becomes easier.;
, You probably have never heard of these before, but yawn sighs are extremely simple and are great for a clean voice. Starting on a high note, drop down to a low note, covering all of the notes in between. It is almost as if you are saying ""Ahhhhhhh."" Repeat this exercise, each time starting on a higher note.

, To do so, take a deep breath (with your diaphragm), push out a random note, and hold it. It doesn't matter if you sound off-key and like a sick monkey. This exercise is good for making a loud voice, but be sure not to harm your throat.

, Water is good for your body and your voice, because a dry throat makes for a dry singing voice.

, This makes it easier to enunciate when singing. Make sure to not worry about what people think.

Choose a song that relates to your age level. Don't choose a song that has to do with inappropriate things for your age. To tell if it is an appropriate choice, play it in front of your parents. If you feel weird to play it in front of your parents, reconsider. Also choice a song that does not have high or long notes you can't do. Think small and don't overdo it.;
, Remembering lyrics are critical to you winning. If you forget them, it's embarrassing and can ruin your flow. Just keep reviewing them and listen to the music video all the time. It also helps to write the lyrics down over and over.

, Delve into what the meaning is. Loss of a love, pain, depression, etc? Once you understand it, think of when you felt that way. If you feel uninspired, watch the original artist sing live in a video. Look at how they move and how their facial expressions look.

, Make sure you've practice a great deal and have all your equipment/clothing ready. Get a good night's rest and try to relax before the event.


Wear something modest. It is hard to believe pain if you are in a tank top and frilly skirt. If you are a girl, wear dark colored eye shadow and lipstick. Once you are ready sing the song over and over until its you turn.

Repeat thirty times.",How to Breathe Properly for Singing2," You will place your hands near waist level. This will allow you to feel how your body moves as you inhale and exhale.

, As you inhale through your mouth, visualize the air moving into your diaphragm, the muscles below your lungs that help you to inhale and exhale. Your hands should move outward as you fill your lower lungs with air., Use your stomach muscles and diaphragm to force the air rapidly and with force. Exhale through your mouth. You will feel your hands moving inward as your diaphragm contracts., As you do this, visualize yourself breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Your abdomen will expand and contract horizontally as you do so. Start out slowly and then pick up the tempo as you continue. If you find yourself slipping into breathing with your chest, stop and start over, breathing slowly again.Repeat this exercise once or twice daily.

Imagine there is a rubber ring around your waist.,
Breathe in and attempt to push the ring outward.,
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.,
Avoid tension in the shoulders.",How to Breathe Properly for Singing3," The key to effective breathing for singing is in the breath. The most important aspect of breathing is breathing with your diaphragm, the muscles underneath your lungs that help them to move air in and out. A great way to visualize breathing with your diaphragm is to picture a rubber ring around your waist. This ring will move in and out, getting bigger and smaller, with each inhale and exhale., As you inhale through your nose, visualize the ring around your waist getting bigger and expanding horizontally. Your stomach should protrude as you inhale this way., As you exhale, attempt to make the ring contract and become smaller. This visualization should help you to breathe with your diaphragm, thus improving your singing. Breathing through your nose ensures better breath control and helps you to breathe in more slowly, allowing you to focus on how you are breathing, rather than how much air you are sucking in., It is common to hunch your shoulders as you breathe. Sometimes tension creeps up on us. Another important aspect of singing is to relax our muscles. This will allow them to move properly. If you feel tension in your shoulders, remind yourself to relax. Visualize your neck getting longer and the tension melting away from your shoulders and into the ground. It can also help to take a few long, deep, slow breaths to relax and stabilize your mind and body."

If you have trouble laying flat on a hard surface, try a carpeted surface or your bed. Use a pillow to support your neck, back, or knees, wherever you feel you need support.

, You will place your hands on either side of your belly button. Your fingers will point toward your belly button., Do not aim to fill yourself until you feel like you are bursting; rather, inhale just enough air to feel the difference between shallow breathing with your chest and deep breathing with your diaphragm. During the inhale, you will feel your hands raise up and outward as they rest gently on your belly. As you breathe in, fill your abdomen from the bottom to the top, noticing your stomach rising first, then your chest.You should not only feel your body expanding at the front, where your hands are, but also at the sides and back.

, Gently exhale and slowly count to five. Do not worry about getting all of the air out of your lungs. You will simply notice your stomach area contract, starting with your stomach and ending with your chest.

Eliminate distractions.,
Pay attention to the lower instruments.,
Listen to phrasing.,
Say it out loud.,
Start with songs you know well.",How to Count Beats in a Song1," When trying to listen for a beat by ear, make sure you give the piece of music all your attention. Use headphones or move to a quiet environment with no noise interruptions.;
, If you’re trying to listen for the basic beat of a song, tune out the top instruments like lead guitar or vocals. Try listening for the bass instruments, like the bass guitar or bass drum. If you’re listening to a digital recording, try turning up the bass so that you can hear it more easily.
In a song, the bass line often carries the steady beat. Ignore the complex rhythm and melody. Try to pick out what feels like the heartbeat of the song.

, A musical phrase is a segment of music that sounds complete in and of itself, often only a few measures long.Practice listening to natural phrasing in music.


Think of listening to a song as though you were listening to a conversation. Where would the breaths be? What sounds like a musical “sentence”? Try counting these smaller sections of the music to find where the downbeats fall.

, Again, use your words, or tap your feet along to the beat that you feel. If you are not on the beat, practicing out loud will make it more obvious and easier to get back on track.

, Familiarity with a song will make it easier to find the underlying beat or pulse. Likely, you already have an underlying understanding of where the beats fall. In learning to find rhythm, repetition is key.

Know your notes.,
Measure it.,
Determine time signature.,
Use your words.,
Use a metronome.",How to Count Beats in a Song2," Before you can begin to count in music, you need to understand how long an individual note or rest lasts. Notes are the periods of sound in a song, and rests represent the lengths of the silences in a piece of music. A whole note lasts for four beats. A half note lasts for two beats. A quarter note lasts for one beat. An eighth note lasts for a half of a beat. A sixteenth note lasts for a quarter of a beat.
Rests follow the patterns of the notes. For example, a half rest is a silence that lasts for two beats.
A dot next to a rest or a note means that the note or rest is increased by half its value. For example, a dotted half note lasts for three beats. , Make sure you understand that every piece of music is divided into parts called measures or bars. This will help you count beats. Every measure in a piece of music has an equal number of beats.

, The time signature appears at the beginning of every piece of music as a fraction. It may change throughout a song, and if it changes, the new time signature will appear at the beginning of a bar. Look to part three below for more information on understanding time signature and determining a time signature by listening to a song.

, As you read sheet music, articulating the beats in a song make them easier to understand and keep track of. For eighth notes, use “and.” Say, “one-and-two-and-three-and-four.” For sixteenth notes, use “e” and “a.” Say, “one-e-and-a-two-e-and-a-three-e-and-a.”In a song, the downbeat is the first articulated beat in a bar. For example, the “one.” Make sure you find and articulate this first.
The upbeat is the “and.” For example, if you are tapping your foot to a beat, the upbeat is the time when your toes are in the air.

, If you know the time signature of a piece, a simple way to help keep a steady tempo while counting beats is to use a metronome. A metronome gives a regular ticking sound with a set rate of beats per minutes. Many free metronomes can be found online."
"
Understand the importance of time signatures.,
Practice counting simple time signatures first.,
Count in compound time.,
Know that complex time signatures sometimes occur.",How to Count Beats in a Song3," To count the beats in a piece of music, you must understand the two components of rhythm: meter and tempo. Tempo is simply a description of how fast or slow a piece of music is. Meter is the regular pattern of beats in a song and how those beats are stressed. Time signatures are fractions that describe the meter of a piece of music.


Time signatures can represent simple time, compound time, or complex time.

, This will help you familiarize yourself with the process of figuring out and understanding the time signature.Simple time can be duple, triple, or quadruple, which means the top number will always be 2, 3, or 4.
In simple time signatures, the bottom number indicates the value of the beat, and the top number gives you the number of beats per measure. For example, in the most common time, 4/4, one beat is a quarter note, and there are four quarter notes per bar.
Unlike compound time, in simple time, you feel the beat in multiples of two. This means that you can divide each note in each bar into two. For example, in 2/4 time, the two quarter notes per bar can each be subdivided into two eighth notes. The natural accent falls in multiples of two or three.
Tap your feet. When figuring out the time signature by listening to a song, pay attention to the beat of the bass line. Try to determine whether or not the pulse you hear can be naturally divided into two. Listen to determine a repeating pattern of rhythm, and count how many notes occur between each repetition.
Remember common time signatures. A lot of Western music uses 4/4 time, so when in doubt, try counting in 4/4 and see if it fits. Familiarize yourself with other time signatures. For example, 3/4 has a waltz feel to it.

, Unlike simple time, compound time is felt in groups of three.For this reason, the dotted note often defines compound time. The top number of a compound time signature is always 6, 9, or 12.


In compound time, divide the top number by three to get the number of beats in a bar. The units of the beats are found in the bottom number. For example, in 6/8 time, there are two beats per measure, and each beat lasts three eight notes, or a dotted quarter note.
The common children’s song “Row Your Boat” can be counted in 6/8 time, beginning with two dotted quarter notes in “row, row.” Try tapping your feet while you sing this song to understand how compound time feels.

, This means a time signature doesn’t fit into the duple, triple, or quadruple categories. For example, 5/8 is a complex time signature because of the odd number 5.


It’s easiest to look at complex time signatures as a combination of simple and compound time signatures.
For example, in 5/8, there is one simple beat (two eighth notes) and one compound beat (three eight notes). The order these beats appear in the measure doesn’t matter.
When you listen to a song that utilizes a complex time signature, you will notice that some of the beats subdivide into two and some into three.
Use your simple and compound counting skills to keep track of complex meters.

Make sure to practice all of the songs you plan on performing and perfect them. Also, think about how your set will affect the listeners. The flow of your songs should take the audience on an emotional journey. Make sure to start and end with something strong., If you want to get known in the jazz world, then you need to develop a unique style that will set you apart from other performers. It's important that you inject your style into the music that you play. Sing in your unique way and dress in a way that will leave an impression.


Famous jazz musician Billie Holiday was known for her intimate but intense approach to songs and she was able to develop a new jazz style by changing the tempo and phrasing of a song.Jazz musicians often have an elevated creativity and are usually good at thinking in unique ways when it comes to music."
"
Look up the lyrics and follow along.,
Ask yourself how the lyrics interact with the music.,
Listen for places the vocalist puts emphasis to find crucial lines.,
Search online for outside context about the track.,
Note where the song ""turns"" or changes on a dime.,
Check out discussions or writing on music to gain a greater appreciation.,
Trust your own interpretation of the lyrics.",How to Understand Music1," The first step to understanding the meaning of lyrics is actually understanding them. Reading along will give you a much more complete picture of the words and eliminate misunderstandings. If you're trying to really dive into a song, you'll need the lyrics on hand to make sense of it. What does the title mean? What do you think the song is about? More often than not, reading the lyrics will give you guidance.Adele's hit ""Hello"" is about heartbreak and sadness. But the title points to something more: the desire and need to reach out to our fellow human beings.
Look up any words or references that don't make sense. This is often the key to making a strange song suddenly clear. Charles Mingus's ""Fables of Faubus,"" for example, only makes sense if you know that Orval Faubus was a racist Arkansas governor.;
, You cannot understand the lyrics fully if you don't listen to them against the music. Instrumentals are how mood is set and how songwriters tell their stories, and cannot be forgotten. Luckily, it is almost all subjective. Ask yourself -- what kind of music would you put behind these words? Why would an artist choose the music they did for background?Beyonce's ""Love on Top"" features a series of key changes that bring her voice higher and higher. The obvious, but important, parallel is that the love she feels is elevating her into the sky.
The Smiths are famous for using bouncy, happy instruments under dark, melancholic lyrics. Perhaps this suggests that there is sadness under the surface of even the happiest people, perhaps not -- it is your call.
Check out covers of your favorite songs to see how different artists approach the same words. Popular songs like ""A Change is Gonna Come"" can have wildly different ""meanings"" depending on the music behind the lyrics.

, The words themselves are important, but the way they are delivered is just as crucial. Where does the singer change up the melody, hit a high note, growl out the words, or put a subtle pause? When you listen to the song, which phrases naturally stick in your brain? These are often the lines that hold the most clues about the songs importance.Even a howl or grunt can give lyrics new meaning, like Marvin Gaye's ""Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)."" When he hits that high note you feel every word of pain in the song in a new light.
Leonard Cohen puts all of ""Chelsea Hotel No.2"" into perspective with a quick, surprising internal rhyme. The song sounds like a love song, up until ""I never suggest that I love you the best"" shows that it is actually about fleeting memory.
Think of the singer has a character, not the specific person. Tom Waits, for example, inhabits all sorts of druggies, gamblers, drivers, and con-men. When you realize he is playing characters, all with unique stories, he makes much more sense.

, Many songs are personal, hiding or hinting at other events without explaining them. Knowing this context can suddenly make the lyrics all snap into place. If you love a song or album, take some time to research how it came about to see if there is anything you never knew.Eric Clapton's ""Tears in Heaven,"" for example, is a poignant song. But it becomes devastating when you learn it is about his son who died young.
Kanye West's album ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" is already powerful, but the knowledge that it was written in the wake of his mother's death gives it added depth.

, This is a technique of many advanced songwriters, and knowing it can help you understand even odd or oblique lyrics. A turn is when the lyrics suddenly shift directions, and this shift is often where people get confused. Realize, however, that this shift is often the point of the song -- to show you how things change or feel misplaced. When reading these lyrics, it is most important to ask two questions: ""how is the end of the song different from the beginning, and how did we get there?Bob Dylan's ""A Simple Twist of Fate,"" is in the third person for every verse until the last one. Suddenly, he starts with ""I."" A impressionistic, cute little song becomes extremely personal, and it is clear Dylan was actually hiding his own sadness in someone else's story.
Common's ""Testify"" is a mob ballad with a twist at the end -- the grieving wife is actually the mastermind. Suddenly, the refrain ""please let me testify"" sounds much more sinister.

, Enter into the conversation by searching what other people think of the lyrics. Sites like RapGenius (which is not exclusively for rap) offer annotated lyrics, giving you a chance to see references or interpretations that you might have missed. Joining into conversation with others is the best way to quickly increase your understanding and open your mind to new interpretations.

, Once a work of art is created you have just as much of a right to ""understand it"" as anyone else. Your own thoughts and opinions matter because no one can say what a song means to you. While there are certainly some interpretations that fit closer to the songwriter's intent than others, you should feel free to think about your personal interpretation."
"
Listen to the song several times and create your own impression and mood.,
Pay close attention to the title.,
Listen to each instrument individually to gain an appreciation for the whole work.,
Ask yourself how the song moves from beginning to end.,
Understand and accept dissonance, which are chords that are harsh to the ear."",
Dive deeper into the specific genre to look for references.,
Learn an instrument or music theory to further your understanding.",How to Understand Music2," Instrumental genres like jazz and classical are daunting to novices. It is easy to feel lost without words to give you guidance. But the biggest mistake most people make is that they forget their own feelings when listening to instrumentals. Do you like the song, or get bored? How does it grow and change from beginning to end?If you're still struggling, close your eyes. What do you see? If this song was in a movie, what kind of scene would it be scored to? Visualization is a great tool for understanding, especially without lyrics.

, The title is your first opening into understanding. It should give you a quick clue to the mood of the song, as well as any image or idea to associate with it. For example:Duke Ellington is a great introduction to jazz because his titles so perfectly match the mood of the song. ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""In a Sentimental Mood,"" ""Take the A-Train,"" and more all capture a specific image, idea, or event with clarity and beauty.
Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" is dark, eerie, and gorgeous. In short, it would fit perfectly under a quiet, moonlit night.
George Winston's repetitive, quiet keystrokes on ""Snow"" gain a depth and softness when you realize they refer to the flurries out his window.

, Instrumental music tells its stories through a variety of instruments. Each piece needs to work together, while still staying distinct, to tell it's story. Try and track each main instrument throughout the song-- you'll be surprised how much nuance and detail you pick up.


Again, trust Duke Ellington to provide an accessible, swinging entry-point. Listen to how multiple instruments layer up to balance each other out and create complex melody lines. His famous suite ""Diminuendo in Blue"" is a good start.Mentally break up orchestras into sections. What are the strings (violins, cello, etc.) doing at one point? How are they balanced by the horns? When does percussion jump in to provided emphasis? Think in terms of groups, all working together to make the music sing.

, Does the volume rise and fall? Does the mood go from happy and light to dark and somber? Does the song end in a similar place to where it began, or does it change profoundly? The best music has movement. That means it takes you on a ride of some sort, holding your interest because you're not sure what comes next.

, When music sounds a little weird, off-the-wall, or grating, it is usually not because the musicians made a mistake. It is because they are trying to point out a complex, often negative emotion. Think of it like a gruesome or tragic scene in a movie -- not everything is a happy or easily portrayed idea. Ask yourself why dissonance helps tell the story of the song, and why a musician would intentionally play ""bad"" sounding music. With great musicians, there is always a reason.


Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite is very difficult to listen to at times, full of harsh noises and jarring changes. But the Civil Rights Movement was anything but smooth and easy.
Miles Davis's complex album Bitches Brew is the first major collision of rock and jazz, mashed up with African rhythms and influences. Music could no longer just be ""one genre,"" and Davis is committed to exploring that idea, even when it gets weird.Doc Woods classical suite Symphonically Speaking contains the suite ""Biota,"" whose messy, weird intro points to messy, weird origins of biology.

, A lot of instrumental music gains power when compared to the songs that came before it. This is not to say the song doesn't hold up on its own. Rather, you can get a deeper understanding by listening to the influences and growth of the music. Jazz, for example, seems intimidatingly complex these days. But it is built on a very accessible body of work -- music that has grown and evolved at pace with American society. If you're looking to start getting into a type of music, check out the earlier works first -- they are usually more accessible.


New jazz fans can find no better starting points than Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. They laid the foundation for many of the artists after them.
Classical fans should, in general, try and see something live. There is no better entry point than the rush and connection with live musicians in concert.Those getting into prog rock and instrumental rock might check out pioneers like Rush and Pink Floyd before moving on to complex modern bands
This is true of almost all music, lyric or instrumental. The Beatles began with simple rock and R&B songs. It is only later that their complex, worldly music grew out of them.

, If you simply want to talk and listen intelligently about music, you can trust your ear, mind, and feelings. But if you want to take it a step further you should move past listening and into creating. This doesn't mean you must become a maestro. Understanding the process of making music, however, will inevitably deepen your understanding of the music itself."

Plug the headphones into your audio device.,
Check for “L” and “R” labels near the ear cups.,
Slip the headphones over your head.,
Place the ear cups directly over your ears.",How to Wear Headphones1," Your device, whether it’s an iPod, laptop, or smartphone, has an audio input that your headphone jack should fit into perfectly. An mp3 player only has one input, which takes any guesswork out of the equation. For a laptop or larger device, you may need to check around the perimeter and on the back to find the right audio input.


The headphone jack should pop into the input without having to be forced. If yours won’t fit, the headphones may be incompatible with the device.
If you have wireless headphones, use your device’s Bluetooth connection to link the headphones to it.;
, Many headphones specify which ear cup goes over the left ear and which one goes over the right. Check around your ear cups for the “L” and “R” markings, which mean ""Left"" and ""Right.""If you find these markings, follow the instructions for distinguishing which ear cups goes over which ear.
If you don’t find these markings, you can wear the cups over either ear.

, The band that connects the cups should fit snugly over the top of your head. Most headphone bands are adjustable, so if the fit isn’t comfortable, try adjusting it. Tug at the band to see if it gets smaller or larger, then adjust as needed.

, Adjust them a bit so that the cups cover your ears comfortably.Over-ear headphones, which have large cushions as ear cups, create a slight seal effect over each ear, which cancels out noise during use. On-ear headphones are smaller, and the cups are usually around the size of your ear. They will fit directly over the ear hole.You may need to remove your earrings if you find that the cups push into the jewelry uncomfortably.

Place the squishy tip just inside your left ear hole.,
Pull the left earlobe down and push the tip into your ear canal.,
Release the left earlobe to create a seal.,
Do the same thing with the right ear.,
Experiment with tip sizes.",How to Wear Headphones2," In-ear headphones look a lot like ear buds, but they aren’t worn in exactly the same way. Ear buds hang from the crevices of your ear-folds, whereas in-ear headphones are inserted directly into the ear canals. Start by situating the squishy tip gently in your ear hole, over the canal. Don’t push it in, just get it in place., Tug your left earlobe down gently with your right hand, which will widen your ear canal. Use your left index finger to carefully push the squishy tip of the left ear speaker into your left ear canal.You do not need to push far. The tip fits just inside the canal.

, Once you’ve inserted the speaker gently into the ear canal, let go of your earlobe. Your ear canal will return to its normal size, causing the walls of your ear canal to hug the speaker. This creates a seal, which ensures good audio. Without getting that proper seal, the audio quality might suffer.You've achieved the proper seal when the sound around you is almost impossible to pick up. You will feel enclosed, in a way, because all sound is isolated in your canal.

, Gently pull down the lobe and insert the speaker. Release the earlobe to create the seal, which cancels out background noise and provides quality audio. You may need to repeat this a few times until you get a feel for how your headphones fit. Always be gentle and never shove the speakers into your ear canals., In-ear headphones aren’t one size fits all, and there should be a range of squishy rubber tips that came with your earphones. These different sizes fit different-sized ear canals. Start with the smallest tips first and, if those doesn’t fit comfortably, go up a size. Keep trying until you find the size that creates that perfect seal.If rubber tips aren’t working for you, go online to purchase foam tips. These tend to work well for most hard-to-fit people.

Look into accessories if you're having trouble with the fit.",How to Wear Headphones3," Some ear bud brands may specify which speaker goes into which ear. “L” means left ear, and “R” means right.The most common kind of ear buds, such as those made by Apple that come with iPods, usually do not have this.


If you don’t see a clear marking, you can place the speakers in either ear.

, Situate the bud in your ear by hooking it into the into the ear hole. The plastic stem connecting the bud to the wire should line up in the same direction as your jawline. Do not push it into your ear canal. It should hang in the crevice in the outer part of your ear-fold., Repeat the same action for your right ear by gently situating the rounded bud into the outer part of your ear hole. Adjust carefully and avoid pushing the ear bud into your ear canal.

, Ear buds are notorious for falling out of the ears, especially during exercise. If this is happening to you, search online for accessories that you can pair with your buds to keep them in place. There is a wide range of different approaches to this, so do a little research and choose the accessory that best addresses your issue.

Realize that scientific pitch notation isn't rocket science.,
Scientific pitch notation combines the name of a note, the accidental (see next step), and the octave in which the given note lies.,
Accidentals are simply the little symbols you sometimes see by a note (either in scientific notation or on a staff) that give whether the note is sharp, flat, or natural.,
When all of the above are combined together, you will be able to look at a scientific pitch notation and know automatically what the note is, what octave it's in, and whether or not it's sharp or flat.

,
C♯4 indicates C sharp (one semitone above natural) in the fourth octave.

,
Congratulations!",How to Understand Scientific Pitch Notation," It's actually a very simple thing to understand once you've actually learned about it. For the purposes of this article, we are going to use the note C natural in the fourth octave (otherwise known as middle C).;
,

The name of the note is a given letter. Each note in a full octave has it's own letter assigned to it, running from A to G.






The number is the octave in which a note lies. C4 means C in the fourth octave, G5 means G in the fifth octave, etc. In scientific pitch notation, this is usually written in subscript.







,

♯ means that the note is sharp, or one semitone above natural. This means that the exact pitch will be exactly halfway between the note given and the next note above it.






♭ means that the note is flat, or one semitone below natural. This means that the exact pitch will be exactly halfway between the note given and the note below it.






♮ means that the note is natural, or simply played or sang as-is.






If there is no accidental, it is safe to assume that the note is natural.







,,, You now understand scientific pitch notation in music!

Understand that not all electronic music is fast or meant for dancing.",How to Understand and Appreciate Electronic Music," To generalize trance or house as ""techno"" is like generalizing death metal as ""rock"". Be willing to listen to new music and search ""What is electronic music?"" In the broadest sense, any music incorporating electronic elements (""instruments"", samples, synthesis, effects) can be considered electronic. Most popular music today could meet this definition.;
, Electronic music commonly uses drum machines, samples (sound clips), and/or synthesizers and effects processors.

, Tempo (song speed) is often measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), and electronic music songs may vary widely in BPM.

You loved the concert you went to, now you want to be one of the people in the pit. People will look down on you and call you a poser, but technically, they are the posers. Punk is all about tolerance and if you don't tolerate new kids, you aren't a true punk.;
, Get on the internet, find some bands that you like. See who their influences are, who they sound like. Go back to the punk roots if you want, for instance, The Sex Pistols, Velvet Underground, Ramones...etc. But if you aren't ready for that, try listening to a band like Bad Religion. They are an excellent example of punk. The lead singer, Greg Gaffin, is an amazingly talented man. He's a professor at UCLA, and has written some brilliant essays on punk. If you like blink 182, try listening to Green Day, if you like Green Day, try listening to NOFX, if you like NOFX, try listening to The Offspring, if you like The Offspring, then The Bouncing Souls, you like them, try The Suicide Machines, etc. Websites like pandora.com will really help you find new music that you like by branching off of what you already like and listen to.

, A true punk will wait for the outcasts to come to them, and accept them for who they are. They will speak out against what they think is wrong and provide a knowledgeable argument about why they think it is wrong. Never judge others, and never ask anyone to change. See the influence pop culture has on society and work against it.

, Racism, sexism, prejudice, and biased opinions of any sort will not be tolerated.

, Don't support anarchy if you don't know what it is, don't support guns if you don't like war, etc.

Store your headphones in a small case.,
Wrap the headphones around an object.,
Store your headphones in a small container.",How to Stop Your Headphone Cords from Tangling1," If you do not have a case for storage, put them in a small pouch in your handbag or backpack so they can stay secured. Next time you use them, the cord will be wrapped rather than tangled.








Grab each of the ends. Starting from the earbuds, wrap your headphones around three of your fingers if you have larger hands, or four fingers if you have smaller hands. Stop wrapping when there is 3 inches (7.62 cm) left. Take out the wrapped part carefully, making sure that it doesn't come apart.Wrap the remaining length of cord around the middle of the headphones. There should be enough cord left to wrap it around the headphones at least twice.Tuck the end in. Once the entire cord has been wrapped around the headphones and you run out of cord to wrap, tuck the end of the cord into the part that’s already wrapped around. Check that it's secured tightly enough.;
, Take a small object, such as a pencil, a hairbrush, or a candle holder, and wrap the cord carefully around. This will hold the headphones in place so that they won’t tangle when not in use.








Tuck the end of the cord into the final loop while wrapping the cord around your object. This will secure the cord and will also allow for easy removal from the object.

, Find a small jar or a prescription bottle, and place your wrapped cord into the container. This way, the headphone cords will be unable to tangle since the small space will keep them in place.

Repeat these steps until each of the knots is untangled.",How to Stop Your Headphone Cords from Tangling2," This will make the untangling process much easier as you can freely move the cord. Be sure to take your headphones off your head. Locate the ends that you put into your ears, often called the earbuds.







, This way, you will be able to examine the cord and find out where it is tangled. Obtain a pen or pencil, as you may need this if the knots are so tight that you cannot untangle them with your hands alone.







, Pull the knot apart with your fingers, in order to loosen the cord and allow for easier untangling. If you cannot use your hands, use the tip of a pen or pencil to separate the cords that are knotted.









Work from the bottom up, since it is easier to untangle knots using a loose end.

, This area should now look like hoop, which you can bring the rest of the cord through using your hands. Run the loose end of the cord underneath the knot.







, You may have to loop the loose end of the cord through several different knots times before the entire cord becomes untangled. Be as patient with yourself as possible, since rushing the process can make the knots even worse.

Set the tone.,
Feel out the crowd.,
Build up the energy.,
Experiment and don’t be afraid to disappoint.,
Take it back.,
Wind down.",How to Select Songs As a DJ," Remember that you are creating the mood and atmosphere of the event, so think about what is appropriate. To set the tone, you should take a few things into consideration.


What type of event is it? The nature of the function you are playing should factor in hugely when deciding what music to play. You wouldn’t play the same songs in a rocker bar as you would at a wine and cheese party or a middle school dance, would you? Here are a couple rules of thumb for different events.

When the focus of an event or a portion of an event should be on something other than the music, play soft, slower tempo music so as to not take attention away from whatever the true focus may be. For example, at an art opening, the focus should be on the art. During the dinner portion of a wedding, this time is usually used to get to know the people at one’s table. In these cases, slower, softer music without overbearing vocals should be used to keep the focus where it should be. Though your music should not be the focus at this time, your music is still an integral part of the event.
When the focus of an event is dancing or partying, make sure to play more upbeat music for the people to dance or sing along to. In this case, your music is the main attraction and your job is to keep people moving.
If you are playing at a lounge or somewhere where the music should inspire some movement, but also not overpower conversations, find a balance with music that gets people to groove, but is not so hard hitting that it will be a distraction. Depending on the crowd, melodic or soulful rhythms tend to work in this setting.


What type of crowd is it? This is perhaps the one case where a certain amount of profiling is not such a bad thing. Many times, it is possible to get a loose grasp on the crowd’s musical taste by looking at their clothes, hairstyle, the way they walk, talk etc. This should not determine what you play the entire night, but instead be used as a testing basis, allowing you to feel out the crowd and better pinpoint their likes and dislikes.;
, Now that you’ve found your starting point and have determined what genres might work best, it’s time to start honing in on what the crowd wants. The first few songs you play for a new audience are like an introduction, so it’s smart to play it a little bit safe until you get better acquainted. Depending on the crowd, top 40’s music is usually a safe bet, since most people hear these songs on a daily basis. Once you get a sense of which jams they respond to, you can decide what to play next to really satisfy them.

, Get them to crawl before they run. If you start off an event with too much excitement, there’s nowhere to go after that and everything else will seem a little disappointing. Also, people might not be ready for craziness right away. More often than not, folks are a little more reserved at the beginning of a party, so it’s important to use your music to stretch their social muscles and get them fully loosened up. As a DJ, you are in charge of bringing the party to its climax and sustaining it as long as possible. Make sure to build up the energy first so they have something to look forward to.

, Once you’ve managed to figure out what works with the crowd, you can start digging deeper into their musical tastes or even get them to fall in love with something they didn’t realize was missing from their lives. But, when you are attempting to expose people to something new, it’s important that you build a foundation of trust first. That way they’re more likely to accept something unfamiliar. If that has already been achieved, then its time to really make your mark and separate yourself from the pack. Remember that you will not always please everyone, but at the same time you can’t be great unless you take chances.


One thing you can do is playing a non-pop or “underground” song that has not received much exposure, but is a great song nonetheless. Nothing builds your reputation like having several people visit your booth asking you what song you’re playing.
Remixes of popular songs are also a good way of making yourself stand out while playing it safe at the same time. With so many producers out now, you can find many quality remixes of songs at record shops or all over the internet.
Creating remixes on the spot can get people to notice you by taking a popular beat or vocals from a song and switching them with the vocals or beat from another song with a matching tempo.

, A lot of times, the best part of a party is when the DJ plays something nostalgic that allows people to revisit a time or recapture old feelings. Nothing takes you back like hearing an old song that you have fond memories of. However, it is important to make sure that the song you’re bringing back has not been played so much that it continues to be corny to this day. Unless, of course, that’s what the crowd wants to hear.

, Just as it was your responsibility to build up the party, it’s your responsibility to cool it down. This is especially important when you are playing for a venue that wants you to help get everyone out at the end of the night. Make sure to play something down-tempo and non-danceable. At any club, a good exit song combined with the club’s “ugly lights” should be sufficient enough to get everyone to depart from the premises without any fighting or bickering.

First off, you should consider if you want this to be a full band or a one man project.,
If you choose to make this a real band, you should find your band members.,
The vocalist will have to be able of snarling (also called shrieking) and maybe growling too.,
Your guitarists should tune their guitar in either classical tuning (E) or D. Remember, this is not meant to be played as deep as death metal.,
The drummer should most preferably know how to blastbeat at a fast pace.,
Find a good bassist that has good timing.,
Some black metal bands use a keyboard to have different sounds integrated in their songs.,
An important part of black metal is the lyrics.,
A good name is also important, and the options here are endless.,
To accompany the band name, create a logo.,
Appearance is not everything.,
Write a song.,
A lot of black metal recordings are of poor quality.,
That's pretty much all you need to know, but if you need some more info about black metal, look around on Wikipedia and Google, then you'll find some.

,
Don't negotiate or come to terms.

,
Never bargain with your stuff...just release it!

",How to Start a Black Metal Band," If you choose the latter, you have to make clear what the advantages and disadvantages is. The advantage is that the creative side is all up to you! The disadvantages is that it will require a lot of skill from your side to handle the instruments and vocal all by yourself. But it can be done, take for example Burzum, Nortt or Xasthur.;
, There are really no limits of how few or many you can be. A good amount will be 3-4, with a drummer, at least one guitarist, a bassist and a vocalist. The vocalist can of course play guitar or bass too. Sometimes even the drummer can be the vocalist.

, The vocals in black metal are mostly mid- to high pitched. Depends on what you want to sound like.

, Heavy distortion is a must; get a distortion pedal or an amp with the ability to turn up the gain. They should know how to play in 16th notes (also called tremolo notes).

, He should also have a double pedal or two singles with 2 base-drums. China cymbals give you a good sound as well as bells. Blastbeats are essential in black metal, because they create the ""wall of sound"" effect. Remember not to blast all the time, unless you want to sound like Marduk. If you haven't got a drummer, get a drum-program and at least some basic knowledge about rhythm.

, The bass and drums are the foundation of your music. In heavy metal music, it is more common for bass parts to be more rhythmical. It would be good to have a bassist who can play a variety of different styles. Don't underestimate the importance of the bassist. One final note, your bassist should have a good ""music ear"". It is more difficult to hear the pitch of lower notes.

, Some use them only to create atmosphere, other almost rely on keyboards (ie. Dimmu Borgir).

, Black metal lyrics usually concentrate on topics like life, death, hate, nature and religion. Satanic lyrics are not essential, but you can write whatever you want. Just remember that black metal lyrics are very serious, and are some of the deepest and most contemplative lyrics found in music.

, Make something up, and use it. Avoid using names like ""Satanik Pervertor"", those are stupid. Also, if you choose a name in another language (e.g. Latin or Norwegian), be sure you know the meaning of it. Cities or districts with significance can be used (Whitechapel, for example, where the Jack The Ripper murders took place). You can also invent a new word to use as a name. If you think this is difficult, you can try to use a random word generator, such as NameDice.com, to get some ideas. In this case you should also find out if you invented a word that already exists in another language, or if it is a company or brand name and should not be used for that reason. It could be a good idea to Google for the name you choose before you start using it.

, You can do it yourself, or you can get somebody else to do it. Again, the options are endless. There are some articles here on wiki-how you can use, just get inspired and be creative.

, A lot of black metal bands dress up in corpsepaint, leather, Boots, Jackets, spikes etc, but this is not necessary. Do what you want.

, There's really no advice here. Make up some good riffs and lyrics, and record it.

, This is the result of musicians not having enough money to record it properly, or someone who just wants to stay ""true"". Try to get a decent quality, but avoid the polished sound of fx Dimmu Borgir. You can record in your room, in a basement, in a forest, whatever, it doesn't matter.

Search the band.,
Find the best albums.,
Get it!,
Listen to it!,
Love it or leave it.",How to Start Listening to a Certain Artist," Look your new favorite band up on Google or another search site. Check Wikipedia; get a brief history of the group.;
, Do some research, or ask someone: what is one of (blank)'s better albums? Check record charts. Which singles did the best? To which album do they belong?

, Get the album, maybe even two, but you shouldn't invest your life savings into the music, because you might not like it. Borrow music if you can, or get it through some...other means.

, For the next week or so, you will be doing nothing but listening to the music. Put it on your MP3 player. If you really want to listen to something else...don't. By exposing yourself to the music for a long time, you subconsciously learn lyrics, sing the songs in your head, and learn to love the music.

, If you like the music, keep it in your library. Listen to it when you want. You have just put another band on your list. You can learn more about the band if you really like them, but if you find that you really don't care for this group, just don't listen to them. At least you'll have something to talk about with a guy who likes a band that you don't.

Turn up the music.,
Get comfortable.,
Develop your alter-ego.,
Find the zone.",How to Rock Out1," No one can tell you what music you can or cannot rock out to. Sure, it's a little tough to jam to Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, but if you're up for a challenge, go for it. Whatever ""it"" is, turn it up.


Turn it way, way up. This is not to burst your eardrums or to attract the attention of neighborhood watch--this is to drown out all worldly distractions. In order to successfully rock out, you must clear your mind of everything keeping you from mastering the air guitar while simultaneously winding up in the drop splits. After all, these things are just holding you back.
Turn down everything else. That means turning off your phone, the TV, and anything else that could possibly awaken you from your soon-to-be rocking reverie.;
, These coming moments are for you and only you. No one else should ever be granted the privilege of witnessing your practiced methods of physio melodic expression.


Wear whatever the heck you want. Some may opt for their old, ratty Peter Frampton Comes Alive! t-shirt from 1975 while others may wish to be naked as a jaybird. Still others may have a red jumpsuit, blonde hair extensions, and light purple eyeshadow that does the trick. Pick your poison for the mood.
Close the windows, draw the curtains, and lock the door. You don't want Earl Hindman peering over his fence to watch you roaming about in your tighty whities or your baby sister walking in to think you're having a seizure. No emergency vehicles should be called during the making of this venture.

, Is he a head-banging, guitar-shredding maniac? Maybe a bootylicious, lascivious heartbreaker? Your identity determines how you rock out.


What instrument does your alter-ego play? Can he feel it coming in the air tonight? If so, would he do an appropriate air drum solo? Or would he dangerously dangle and spin a mic cord as he sticks his thumbs in his too-tight-if-he-weren't-a-rockstar leather pants? How often would he break his air guitar?

If you know how to play a rockin' instrument, or are learning, these same principles apply. However, it's a little hard to get down on the clarinet. Unless, of course, you can power-slide while playing a little diddy.


If your other half is a little more toned down and wouldn't be caught attempting to breakdance on a shag rug, fear not! One can rock out with dance, song, and crumping.

, The danger zone. You'll know you're there when time stops but the music continues. Don't think about it! Let it happen. Let it flow. You'll know you achieved a rocker's nirvana afterward.


Let your hair down. While you headbang, the freedom will wash over you like holy water on a baby's bare head. Not a hair on your scalp or a muscle in your body should feel restricted.
Climb on virtually everything that can be climbed on without breaking. Your rocking out should exist on all planes. That means you rock out on the floor, on the bed, on the tables, but not on your mom's collection of ceramic cows.
Close your eyes. You see that nothing in your hands? Nope, you don't. That's your own custom Fender Telecaster. And that Berber carpet? NO! That's a mosh pit. So be careful.

First tip is to Listen, the more music you listen to the more inspiration you'll get, the more creative you can be.,
Choosing an instrument:Start with an instrument you like, don't look for ""easy instruments"", there is no such thing, any instrument requires frequent practice and study, Choose the instrument that best suits the genre you want to go with, Piano and Guitar are great for many genres and are very popular songwriting tools so you can easily find lessons online and start practicing (I'm a guitarist so maybe I'll be posting a guitar guide too).,
Learning Your Instrument:Learning a musical instrument is like anything, It requires patience and the key to mastering it is nothing but Practice , Practice as much as you can and if you practice daily for at least 15 minutes everyday you'll get better results than only practicing 3 hours one day and not practicing others, so practice regularly.

,
If you can afford to have a private teacher do it, it the best thing as everyone can have a different experience with the instrument a teacher will prevent you from acquiring bad habits and can solve your problems, Joining a music class is also a good choice, You can also Look for lessons on the Internet , make an email account (a precaution) and join free newsletters of sites that offer lessons for free, read and watch, if you can pay, after checking the free lessons, go with what you feel has best helped you, one important thing.... NEVER GIVE UP!,
Now that You're Starting To Get Better At your instrument, you want to start composing, so I'll give you simple ideas to help you on your way.

,
Two important things to know :1-when you create a song try to make it have a theme not just a mix of unrelated stuff.,
Composing Music By Ear:For some people It's hard to get all these music theory things memorized, and if they already have a good ear for music, what a person like them would do, is to use this great tool (Their Trained Ears) To start making their tracks, They may have a certain song idea , riff or a chord progression in their minds, they transfer it to the instrument, and then continue building on it, For some people this is easier than music theory, It may not do well critically, but it can be popular with listeners, but even these composers know about music theory a good deal.

,
Composing to another Song:If you listen to a song you like, it could inspire you to make a song of your own, It may give you a musical idea or a certain beat or melody to start with, it's a very easy way to help you start making your first tracks, just listen to the music and get inspired, think of things you can add to it or a change you can make, it may turn down a completely different song!,
Composing to a sample:You can find many online sites that offers samples or loops like a drum beat or a riff, try some out maybe one of them can trigger your musical head to action!

,
Composing to a riff:Scales are the best ways to make riffs, if you jam with a scale you can come up with a riff, then use this riff as the base for your song , many artist make riff based songs, especially rock artists, even hip hop can contain a repeated guitar riff or bass loop.. try it.

,
Composing to a Scene or a situation:Imagine you were asked to make the soundtrack for a movie, and then imagine that movie, the scenes, the story , the atmosphere, what kind of feel does it give you?, try to express that in music..

,
Composing by Lyrics:If you experienced a situation that you want to express, write it, then rewrite it but try to get it more into phrases and try to make these phrases equal in length (musically) then you can try to put similar ending words...that's it, you have a basic lyric form!,
Building it Up:Now that you have some ideas , start thinking of the song's structure, the very basic can be
intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge or solo, chorus, outro
You can make it even simpler , be creative, you can make a song with no chorus, give it a strong structure, if you feel a part is weakening the song, remove it, add bridges and mini bridges, some variations of the verse and chorus will make it more exciting , the small things can be greatly useful, some mini riffs and melodies makes it more emotional.,
Keep it simple, Your composing abilities will get better by trying and listening.

",How to Start Creating Music," I guess if you want to make music you already listen to loads, but diversity is another cool thing that will make your music more appealing and exciting, listen to as many genres and artists as you can, Listening to more music makes your mind ready and can help you complete a 3 note pattern to a riff, it greatly enhances your internal metronome which is one of the most important things a musician should have, also by having a broad musical knowledge, you can easily attract more audience as music is a matter of subconscious as it is a matter of emotions. so You need to get your subconscious musically adapted!;
, So Choose your instruments, Don't spend a lot of money, it's not wise to spend a lot on something that you may not want to continue, Set a budget, buy a nicely built affordable instrument , if you have a friend who plays that instrument you may want him\her to try it for you he\she can tell you if it has something wrong, research before buying, if you have a certain instrument that you like and suits your budget, keep on researching for days and weeks for more info , reviews, demos about it and it's alternatives, Google it, YouTube it, look it up at musical stores' websites, as much as you can, be patient so that you can be sure you've got the best that suits your budget and don't regret buying this and not buying that instead.Enjoy!

,, there are time when you'll feel that you are not progressing, all musicians have this feeling often, but don't let this get you down, listen to some music it may re inspire you to keep practicing! hang out with musicians go to concerts, watch videos of your favourite artist, it's all good to motivate you, just keep practicing, challenge yourself and try new ideas don't bore yourself you must enjoy it, isn't this your passion?! be sure that the more you work, the more you'll get in return.

,, 2- Try to have your own sound, meaning, when someone listens to your music he/she should be able to know that's this is yours..Create your own sound..but that comes later on and takes some time.

,, you can change the key of the song (you'll need to know more about key signatures) , change the beat....etc , the point is to experiment with it.

,,,, what you want to do now , is to give it a melody, descend and ascend with them words, if you can make a musical phrase with them....Great! just get them feel like a song to your ears. then you might want to experiment with a chord progression, find a one that suits these words and the mood you want them to sound like, Happy (major), Sad (minor).

, Don't forget the hook, It's the part of the song that keeps on reminding you of the songs even when you're not listening to it, it can be vocals or an instrument that makes the hook.

Prepare the look.,
Crank the jams.,
Get moving.,
Be responsible.",How to Rock Out2," If there's potential to rock out, think like a Boy Scout. You may not be able to rock out as hard in flannel and suspenders (""braces"" for you British folks with your eyebrows all a-flutter). Think ahead. How much rocking are you capable of?


Jeans and a t-shirt is always classic for either sex.
Is this a party where you can gallivant discalced? Or will you be keeping your shoes on? Consider this when choosing your footwear.
Ladies, get ready to move. The last thing you want is to interrupt your metal horns to adjust your hemline. Wear something comfortable.

, If they're not already being cranked. But let's face it, you shouldn't be the one to have to get the party started. What kind of party are you even at? Your own? Ah, alright. Proceed.


Find music that gets everybody going. In this circumstance, rocking out is a community bonding session. You'll feed off their energy and they will feed off yours. As a result, a beautiful thing will become nascent. Take time to feel the vibes and let it brew.
Don't crank the jams too loudly. The police hate that.

Sting loves it, however.



, By this time, the party-goers should be in a distinctive yet morphing shape. Get in there! Show them your stuff.


Use your body. Don't be afraid to get on your knees or pop a handstand (you've been practicing after all, right?). Just make sure the area is clear before you risk popping someone's eye out. Then the fun and games just stop.
Jump up and down. And then up and down again. And possibly a few times after that. If no one else is jumping, start it. They'll wonder why they aren't jumping with you. And hey, calf workout!

, Rocking out can be a great release and is sometimes necessary, but it also can be incredibly dangerous or, at worst, fatal. Drinking and driving, smoking, and other illicit drugs get all the hype--think of rocking out like the Korean War (when was that again?). Just because it doesn't receive the appropriate anti-marketing campaign doesn't mean you should rock out carelessly.


Watch your elbows. Those things can be weapons of destruction if flailed about angrily.
Stay sober. Drunken rocking out is a recipe for disaster and a recipe for a trip to the temple of the porcelain gods. Besides, you'll want to remember this cathartic experience when it's over.
Don't judge other rockers. They may not have the skills you do and that's fine. They may be rocking out to One Direction...also...fine...mostly. Either way, these people are made up of the same stuff you are: stuff that's looking to rock out. Embrace them.

"
"
Choose your attire wisely.,
Carry only what you need.,
Get on the floor.",How to Rock Out3," Novices can make critical, rocking-out-impairing mistakes. Before you have the time of your life, you must be fashionably prepared.


Opt for the metal t-shirt. This DOES NOT MEAN the t-shirt you bought at the merch stand. Oh, no, no. Find your Pink Floyd: A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour tee (even if there are armpit stains) and mount the floor section with pride. You'll be the guy in the sweet t-shirt with cred and mystique.

The louder the better, generally. Stick to the same genre as the artist you're seeing. If that's not an option, bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Pantera, Guns and Roses, Ac/Dc, The Doors, Motorhead, etc. are a safe bet.


Don shorts or pants. If you'll be in the pit, you'll get sweaty, sticky, and hot very quickly. Keep this in mind.
Wear sturdy shoes. Let me repeat: WEAR STURDY SHOES. Do you want a bloody toe? Because your feet will get stepped on. Tennis shoes are okay, but leather boots are better.
Keep your hair out of your face. You'll be glad you did when the sweat is pouring down your brow. What's more, don't use dyes. Being one of 1,000 people with pink running down their faces at a Gwen Stefani concert is not what you're aiming for.

Girls: the same things apply. DO NOT wear a skirt. It may get torn.



, This means a bit of money, chapstick, keys, ID, and, of course, the ticket. That last part is pretty important.


You'll be in a crowd of a zillion people. Make sure your belongings are secure. If they're not, they may get lost or stolen. If your front pockets aren't big or safe enough, get a small bag to put under your t-shirt.

A camera may or may not be allowed. Check the ticket for details. If it's not, leave your phone in the car or at home.



, It's rocking out time. The time we've all been waiting for. Take cues from the crowd if you're unsure or rock out to the beat of your own drummer, so long as he's keeping time with the one onstage.


Master the head-bang and surging rock hand-gesture (metal horns). Along with jumping (which you can presumably already do), these are the fallbacks in any mosh pit.

Place your index and ring finger in toward your palm. Raise your hands in the air like you just don't care accordingly.


Keep an eye out for crowd-surfers. They're probably not concerned about keeping their elbows tucked. It's best to only become one of them if you're in a big group of people who literally have your back. Otherwise, you may get dropped, lose a contact, and get your wallet stolen.
Get close to the stage! The closer you are, the more hypnotizing the feel. Don't shove your way forward inciting irritated looks from those around you--but if you see a path, go for it.

"
"
Put safety first.,
Pump up the volume.,
Utilize your surroundings.",How to Rock Out4," Do not attempt to rock out while zooming down the Autobahn at top speeds. Intense jamming can be very distracting and endanger the lives of others if done incorrectly.


Remove all uncovered liquids from the rocking out area. Hot coffee on your lap is not a good look on anyone.
Only rock out when stuck in a traffic jam, on the open road, or at a stop light. Driving should be your first priority, rocking out your second. True, this makes for less than ideal rocking out conditions, but sometimes it just has to do.

, If a song comes on the radio and you find yourself squealing, let your inner rocker come alive.


If you're in a residential area, roll up your windows. Babies are trying to sleep! If you run into the cops, you could be charged with disturbing the peace.

If you're on the open road, roll 'em down and feel that breeze in your hair. Feel it? That's the freedom to rock out. Be grateful. Not everybody lives a life of such rocking privilege.



, Just because you're in a car does not mean your skills should be compromised.


Your steering wheel is your drum and your seatbelt is your guitar strap. The road is your home. Go ahead! Punch, headbang, shimmy, and grit your teeth.

Do these things with your eyes open. At all times. Keep your eyes on the road. Rocking out in a car requires the art of multitasking. Always put safe driving first.

Define rock music.Rock music has become so big that it's hard to define it in simple terms.,
Accept rock as an umbrella of genres.,
Get hold of a working system to play music on.,
Dive into the classics first.,
Listen to rock music on the radio.,
Listen to songs through streaming audio.,
Get hold of a few albums and listen to them.,
Listen to the latest rock hits.,
Look into genres that rock has spawned.,
Read up on rock artists.,
Attend live shows.,
Wear rock merch and fashion.,
Accept the potential stigma of enjoying rock music.,
Keep looking for new music.",How to Start Listening to Rock Music," However, most would agree that it is typically guitar-based music with a driving beat and a lot of energy. The definition of rock has changed a great deal over the years. Simply put, the more rock you hear, the better you'll be able to define it for yourself.


What counts as rock and what doesn't can come into question. For instance, the Beatles are generally regarded as the world's most famous rock band, but they're more often referred to as a pop group.;
, To start, it is important to grasp just how vast rock is before listening into it. While rock n' roll originally referred to a wave of American artists who injected a new energy into rhythm and blues music, the term could be used now to refer to the majority of guitar-based music to some extent.Because of how diverse it is, there is a style out there for everyone. Although it's generally recommended to start with the most well-known artists at first, the diversity means you'll find more specific artists for your tastes before long. Here are several of rock's best-known genres:


Pop rock uses rock instrumentation (like guitars) with pop songwriting. Bands include The Beatles and Coldplay. Listen to this if you want something light and catchy.
Progressive rock fuses rock instrumentation with ambitious classical songwriting and experimental song structures. Bands include Van der Graaf Generator, Yes and King Crimson. Listen to this if you want something intellectual.
Hard rock is an edgier, more distorted version of rock. Bands include Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Listen to this if you want something that's heavy, but still perfectly accessible.
Psychedelic rock makes use of lots of guitar effects to mimic the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Bands include Ozric Tentacles and Pink Floyd. Listen to this if you want something weird and atmospheric.
Heavy metal pushes the heaviness of rock to the point where it counts as another genre. Metal has its own diverse range of sub-genres, including black metal, power metal and doom metal. Bands from the original period of heavy metal include Judas Priest and Black Sabbath. Listen to this if you want something angry and theatrical.

, In an age of MP3 players and streaming audio, there have never been so many different ways you can listen to music. While a CD player may be the standard choice for some in this regard, a computer with working speakers and an internet connection is all you need to hear as much new music as you want. Other popular mediums include vinyl and cassette. Each of these mediums provides its own unique experience of the music. You should try a few of these mediums and compare the difference in the way the music sounds.


If you're going to use a computer primarily for your music, you'll need a working media player installed in order to play music. Windows Media Player and iTunes are the most popular.However, it's recommended you use WinAmp if you're looking for a digital media player.It is more customizable than the typical players, and takes up less memory than iTunes.

, Rock music has a lot of classic albums that are considered ""essential"" listening by fans of the genre. If you're looking for some of the most essential rock albums to listen to, you should read up on some best-of lists. Magazines like Rolling Stone have definitive lists that should get you started.Other user-based websites like RateYourMusic feature extensive lists by passionate music aficionados as well, if you're looking for something off the beaten path.Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen and Yes are all some of the most important groups you should start with. Their music is widespread and is likely familiar to you already if you listen to the radio.
Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" is commonly referred to as the greatest rock song of all time.This has ironically caused backlash of people who are sick from the song's overplay. If you haven't heard the song before however, it's a perfect way to get into the genre.

, Most cities have at least one radio station dedicated specifically to rock music.Rock stations can usually be divided into classic rock radio (hits from the 1960s-80s) and modern rock (playing contemporary hits). For many people, the radio is their first exposure to rock music. Tune into the radio and listen in. Most of the time, the DJ hosting the show will announce the artist and song title. This is a fast way to gain knowledge if you don't know much about the genre.


Satellite and digital radio stations are also available, and can offer a much more specialized (and ad-free) alternative to standard FM.

, Websites like Spotify and YouTube are an amazing resource if you want to listen to a lot of a certain genre.Provided you have a stable web connection, you can search up virtually any song you want, or play a pre-made playlist for new recommendations. YouTube is arguably the best way to hear a lot of new artists quickly, as it offers a list of recommendations as soon as any song finishes playing. The band and song name are also clearly visible, making it easy to mark something down if a certain tune really strikes you.


After listening to a few songs, you should start to get an idea of the kind of rock that will most appeal to you.
If you're trying to cover a lot of ground quickly, it's recommended you hear songs from different subgenres. Hard rock, pop rock, prog, punk and black metal all fit under the rock umbrella and have very different sounds to them.

, Unlike pop music, rock is best listened to in a full album form. An album can give a much more vivid impression on a listener than a single song. Once you've heard a few songs you like, you might want to check out those albums in full and see what you think. Buy the CD of the album from a music store, or get the album on the computer through streaming or download. Find a quiet time and listen to the album from start to finish. If you're looking for a place to start, here are some essential classics you should check out first:


The Beatles' Sgt. Peppers' Lonely Hearts Club Band

Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon

Led Zeppelin's IV

Yes' Close to the Edge

David Bowie's Hunky Dory


, Rock music is still alive and well today. There are lots of bands from all over the map who are making new music. If you're still getting the hang of rock music. You should check up on the latest Billboard posting to see what's currently topping the charts.Listen to a few of the songs and decide for yourself. Compared to the classics, the definition of rock as ""chart-topping"" music may be blurrier.


Some of rock's best-ever artists have emerged from the modern era. Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and the Mars Volta are a few of the most inventive groups to have come out of the last 25 years.

, While traditional rock music's apex was during the 1960s and 70s, there are subsets of rock that have swelled into complete categories of their own. Punk and metal have two of the most passionate fanbases of any music genre. Bands in these categories rebelled against rock when it got too comfortable, taking it to new heights. Rock has also been combined with every genre possible, including jazz (jazz fusion) and hip-hop (rap rock).


If you like other genres of music already, you should look for bands that combine it with rock. Some artists might make a gimmick of it, while others will break brave new territory in doing so.
Although rock is arguably less popular in pop culture than it used to, the culture for metal fandom is extremely vivid., There are some great life stories behind the making of the music. Once you've done some research and listened to the bands themselves, it can be enjoyable to look at the biography of an artist you're into and see what their story was. There are lots of documentaries based around rock culture that may be of interest to you.In the majority of cases however, it's easiest to type the band's name into Google and look at whatever links that appear interesting to you.


Knowing a bit about the artists behind music can help improve your appreciation of their music, especially if their lyrics are inspired by their life experiences.

, Some music fans would say the only way to truly appreciate rock music is to see it performed live and onstage. Bands frequently go touring, and play concerts at scheduled venues from city to city. If there's a band you really appreciate, it can be exhilarating to witness the band do their thing in front of you. There's a more immediate energy in live performances compared to the recorded version. In addition, you can meet the musicians in person and buy merchandise at the venue.


Hearing loss is a potential risk at concerts. If you go to enough shows, this hearing loss can add up and become significant. It's recommended you take some precautions at live shows to avoid this. Bring a set of earplugs with you, and make a point of staying at least 10 feet (3 m) away from loudspeakers., Music and fashion are closely linked, especially in rock subgenres.Many fans of this music will show their love for a band by wearing band shirts. If you really care about a band, you can advertise your passion by buying a shirt. A lot of fashion trends have been inspired and mirrored by rock musicians.


Wearing band merch can be the starting point for a friendship with a stranger who may approach you based on their mutual love for the band.
Don't wear merch for bands you don't like. This is not looked well upon in the subculture.

, From the very start, rock music has been about rebelling against the establishment. Although rock music has become institutionalized in the Western world, there are still more recent artists (like Graveland or Nine Inch Nails) that cause controversy for their beliefs, behaviour or lyrical content. Religiously conservative cultures may take offence to any kind of rock music.Being a fan of this music means you may be criticized by people around you.

, There will never be enough time to hear all of the music that's worth hearing. This is a good and bad thing. While on the one hand you'll never be able to experience it all, you'll also never run out of chances to be amazed by something new. The best thing you can do is to keep a healthy thirst for new music. Listen to the latest albums coming out. Look back on a classic record you haven't heard before. Dig deep into the underground and dish out something obscure. The possibilities are endless. A love of new music shouldn't be limited to one's youth. An appreciation of rock will last the rest of your life once it catches on.


Websites like RateYourMusic are a perfect way to stay up to date on the best (and worst) of new music."

, This could be GarageBand, Logic, Cubase, ProTools or even Audacity!

, Guitars? Bass? Drums? Make sure you have the necessary equipment to record these. For guitars and basses with your amp and one or two cables, it's okay. For drums you might need specific mics that are quite expensive.

, Take off the end of the cable that is connected to the amp.


You might need a little adapter to convert from a 6.35mm end to 3.5mm (standard headphone jack measure), then plug it to your computer's Audio-In port. (Usually next to the Audio-Out, or where you plug headphones or in newer Mac models, it's the same for Audio In & Out)

, Make proper adjustments for the DAW to recognize your guitar plugged and for the program to record from that line (either Mono or Stereo).

, You can also mic your amp, by putting the mic close to the amp and set the program to receive that signal.

, For the drums you can use Drum Machines included on some DAWs, like GarageBand or Acoustica Mixcraft.

If you've got an old model analog cassette stereo, pop a fresh cassette tape in, hit record, and play acoustic interments close to the input. For better quality, consider lining in a straight AV cable mic with the appropriate jack.

, On YouTube, there are many different backing tracks you can find for writing your own song to.

, Once you have it in your head what sort of melody you could sing, the whole process will be easy.

Rockstar!",How to Be Like Axl Rose," First things first, clothes of course! To be like great Rose, you have to dress like him. He wore a lot of leather, as did most rockers from the '80s. He wore tight leather pants, usually with a big old belt over top, and when not wearing leather pants he wore good ol' tight jeans. Any kind of skinny jean would be just fine. He also wore suspenders frequently, any plain, wide suspenders will do. He also wore cowboy boots with his pants. Rose has a famous pair of sneakers. They are Converse really and they say ""Axl"" on the the tongue and heel. He is often seen wearing these in music videos and such. On some occasions, he would wear kilts like those we associate with Scotland. A major Axl icon is his bandana, which he wore in videos and in public very often. He wore it on his head, with his sunglasses perched on top or a color-coordinated, straight-brim baseball cap backwards over top, and it is a huge contribution to Roses style as for shirts, they ranged from simple baggy t-shirts, to tight tank-tops, to leather jackets on top. He also wore a Thin Lizzy shirt frequently. Really, leather is a big thing involving Axl's style, and one strange outfit like white skin-tight shorts or an American Flag patterned piece of clothing is very ""Axl Rose himself"";
, Axl wasn't one of those glam boys, like Bret Michaels or Jon Bon-Jov;, who wore tons of make-up or a whole can of hairspray per show (normally). Instead, Axl had long, straight natural hair. His hair color is naturally strawberry blonde meets red, but any color hair will be fine as long as it's long, straight, and hairspray free. The only time you might catch him with teased hair is during certain concerts, especially in the earlier days. But, for the most part, his hair was long and straight. At some points, Axl's hair was parted down the middle and was all one length, but later into his career, it was parted more on the side and he had bangs. Figuring out how to cut your hair to be like Axl's is a) very simple since it's long and straight and b) easy since there are tons of pictures you can search for, and get an idea of how his hair looked.

, One of Axl's most famous trademarks is known as ""The Snake"", because he moves his body in a snake-like fashion, as a snake does when it slithers. It is also simply called the ""Axl Dance"". To truly be like Axl, you must master or come pretty close to nailing the Axl dance. You can see his dance in most music videos, including ""Welcome To The Jungle"", ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", ""Yesterdays"" and many others. The dance features Axl moving his lower body from side to side, usually holding a the microphone stand. Try your hardest to nail the Axl Dance, and it will be your instant ticket to being like Axl Rose.

, Axl Rose is known for being a maniac, constantly leaving shows early, coming to shows late, and getting angry very easily. He also holds the record for ""rockstar with most feuds concerning other musicians/celebrities"". However, he was actually a very nice person and to be like Axl doesn't mean you have to treat everyone you meet like crap and let your band/friends down. As long as you don't let anyone mess with you and you always defend yourself, you will do just fine. Besides, Axl had a softer side, and we can see that with songs he wrote for his girlfriends. He has also stated how devastated he is that he never had children. Truly, Axl is probably a good person underneath it all. Just be yourself and don't let people get away with talking bad about you. This does not mean starting fights constantly; you want to be like Axl Rose, not be him!

, Axl Rose is a musician, so listening to Guns 'N' Roses is obviously something that seems like it would apply to ""being like Axl"", however, having the look is most important. If you are in a band or like Guns 'N' Roses (and I mean earlier GNR, you don't have to like GNR now, Axl's style now doesn't apply) it is definitely a plus. If not, and you just admire his badass persona and rock n roll style, it's all good if you don't listen to or like GNR, because Axl's style is unique to himself. And there you go!

Write what you know.",How to Rock and Roll," If you want to rock 'n roll, you owe it to yourself to listen to as much rock music as possible. Every other concern, from style to attitude, should take a big second place to listening to rock music. From the classics to the modern masters, any good rock 'n roller spends a serious amount of time researching new bands, checking out records, and banging your head to the beat.


Lovers of any genre have a tendency to get territorial and petty. What is ""real"" rock music? For some people, there's nothing worth listening to after Hendrix died, while others think the genre was invented sometime in the 90s. Leave petty arguments to the YouTube comment stream. Great rock music is being recorded today, great rock music was recorded 60 years ago. Listen to all of it and ignore the rest.
Real rock 'n rollers just want to rock. Listen to everything, regardless of the genre, the style, or the sound. Only worry about one thing: whether or not it rocks. Try it out and see for yourself.;
, If you have any desire to be a rock and roller, classic rock is probably the cause. It's a hard-to-pin-down term, especially since classic rock radio stations play music that's barely 15 years old, but it most regularly refers to rock and roll music recorded between the mid-60s and the mid-70s.


Classic rock bands include Rolling Stones, The Who, Cream, Jimi Hendrix,Skid Row and many others. The specific sound and style of the music varies significantly. Most classic rock is guitar-based, predominantly featuring guitar riffing and solos, as well as howling vocals and fast rhythms.
Depending on who you ask, more recent bands as diverse as Nirvana, Guns 'n Roses, Bad Company, and Kansas may be considered ""classic"" rock. It's got less to do with a time-frame and more to do with an attitude.

, Rock's got a reputation for volume and intensity. Pete Townshend of the Who famously blew out his eardrums when he loaded drummer Keith Moon's kick drum with dynamite for an on-stage prank, setting new records for rock and roll volume. Fortunately, rockers have kept up the tradition. If classic rock just doesn't do it for you, check out the more extreme cousins of the classics.Punk rock blew up in the late-70s as a direct response to the bloat and pretension of the classic rock bands filling arenas at that time. No extended 30-minute James to be found here, just three chords and the truth. Check out classic punk with The Stooges, The Clash, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Damned, and the Zero Boys. More modern versions of the classics include the Black Lips, True Sons of Thunder, and the Oblivians.
Heavy Metal is the most extreme version of rock and roll. Originating with the dirge-like heaviness of Black Sabbath, heavy metal has spread and segmented into a nearly endless variety of sub-genres and styles, peaking and blowing up in the 1980s. Check out Judas Priest, Motorhead, and Metallica for an intro.

, Check out the grandfathers of the genre. Early rock or oldies refers to the birth of rock 'n roll, when country mixed with R&B and blues to create a new style of music. Check out early Sun Studios recordings by Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to hear the sound, as well as Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Ike Turner, and Gene Vincent to get a sense of the first practitioners. It's still super-cool.


If you want to go deeper, find the great-great grandfathers of the music by exploring the heaviest and most potent distillation of American music: the blues. A folk music sung and perfected by African-American laborers and sharecroppers throughout the South, blues music can be heavier than Zeppelin and spookier than black metal. Check out Blind Willie Johnson, Charley Patton, Geechie Wiley, and Bessie Smith if you want to hear some of the best music ever put to wax.

, Every rock fan owes it to themselves to visit the holy land. Memphis, TN is that Mecca. Memphis is a melting pot, where country music, blues, and R&B mixed together to form a unique new style. This is the land of Elvis, of Carl Perkins, of Johnny Cash, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Milton. Walk down Beale Street, the Las Vegas of blues music. See Sun Studios, where some of the most iconic rock musicians recorded, from Roy Orbison to Bono. If you're not big on the roots of rock, find other rock pilgrimages to go on and get up close with the rock and roll homeland. Try visiting:


Liverpool, the working class English shipping town, where the Beatles formed. Check out the Cavern Club, where they used to perform. Go see Penny Lane and Strawberry Field, which are real places.Joshua Tree State Park, the psychedelic desert region in Southern California where Gram Parsons was cremated and which provided the name for the iconic U2 record.
Jim Morrison's grave in Paris. Other than the Lizard King, the Père Lachaise in the Marais houses lots of notable historical figures, from Chopin to Proust. It's a spooky paean to the past.

, Every rock and roller needs to have the experience of standing in the crowd and feeling the rush of seeing a great rock band come on stage. When the stage lights go dark and the crowd comes to life, there's just nothing like it on earth. Show up early and check out the opening acts to get tips on new records and new bands to check out, then stand in anticipation for the headliners. Scream your head off.


You don't have to shell out mega-scratch to see a big band play live. Acts like Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones charge obscene ticket prices, but most towns have vibrant and great local scenes that can satisfy your rock fix. Seek out all-ages venues in your town to find out where you might see local bands that will help expand your taste and your opportunities to rock.

, The invention of the 12-inch 33 1/3 rpm vinyl record revolutionized the way we listen to music. Before vinyl, there was no concept of an ""album,"" there were just songs. If you're going to be a true rock 'n roller, you owe it to yourself to hear the classics the way they were meant to be heard, on vinyl records, played through a turntable, preferably at neighbor-disturbing volumes. You've never heard Dark Side of the Moon until you've dropped the needle into the groove on side one.

, Rock and roll is synonymous with cool. If you want to rock, or you want to develop a reputation as a rock 'n roller, which means playing it cool. Whether you're at work, at school, on stage, or hanging out, you've got to learn to kick back and go with the flow. The world is your living room. Relax in it.


Don't get excited about anything but rocking. Your partner's breaking up with you? Big deal. You've had a terrible day at work? Who cares? Rock and rollers can be chill in the face of dire situations. Be unflappable. Let nothing rattle you.

, Check out the cover of the Beatles Rubber Soul. From the perspective of years, they look relatively clean-cut, though at the time, those moppy-headed Liverpudlians were downright dangerous-looking. Hairstyle is intimately linked to rocking and rolling. The length and the style of your hair can be a political act, growing it long in direct defiance of the square-establishment, or cutting it all of in the face of traditional gender norms. Your hair is one of the best ways to identify yourself as a rocker.


For a guy, growing your hair long can still be a great way of rocking out. Head-banging with a full mop of rocker hair is one of the true pleasures of life. Alternatively, shaving it down, or cutting a mohawk is common among punk rockers.
For a girl, a variety of styles and cuts fit in with the rock and roll look. Depending on what you're into, a big streak of electric blue in your hair could do the trick, or cutting it super-short, or leaving the bangs long to grow a hippie-cut, like Joni Mitchell.

, Rock and roll style is one of the easiest styles to pull off. Inexpensive, basic, and cool, rock clothes don't even have to be clean to look totally rad. Cultivating a rock and roll wardrobe is easy by following a few basic steps:


Buy used clothes. Second-hand thrift stores are a great place to buy rock clothes. Old flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and funny t-shirts are a great way of pulling off a devil-may-care look. Be anti-mall.
When in doubt, go with Chucks. Chuck Taylor All-Stars are the most iconic rock and roll shoe, following up closely perhaps by Beatle Boots and Doc Marten punk boots.
Rep your favorite bands with their t-shirts. One of the best ways to identify yourself as a rocker is to wear the shirts of your favorite labels, rock bands, and artists. Seen a great band in concert? Get the t-shirt.
Don't be afraid of accessories. For rock guys and girls, necklaces, bracelets, and bandanas are always appropriate. Go easy on the tie-dye and the hemp, though. There's a fine line between ""rock and roller"" and ""hippie.""

, Check out old press photos of Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, and Elvis Presley. Sunglasses make the rocker. Indoors, outdoors, doesn't matter. Wear shades, preferably simple, medium-framed, and solid black. Turn up the cool-factor wherever you are by investing in a great pair of basic sunglasses.

, Rock in the footsteps of the rockers who've come before you by coming up with your rock and roll heroes, gurus, and saints. Every rocker will have their favorites, and you should be no different. Find a musician that speaks to you, that goes deep and makes a connection with you personally, and go deep into their back catalog. Read everything you can.


Read some classic musician and rock lifestyle biographies to help you get a sense of the mythology and the stories associated with rock and roll. Keith Richards' Life and Johnny Cash's Cash are two of the best books about life and rock ever written.
Check out documentaries about your favorite rock musicians. Featuring on-stage footage and intimate interviews, rock-docs can be one of the best ways to get up close and personal with your favorite rockers. Bob Dylan's Don't Look Back, The Band's The Last Waltz, and The Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter all show the ups and downs of rock stardom, showing their subjects at their best and worst.

, Rock and roll has a reputation for excess, and it's important to draw a line somewhere in your excursions and explorations. Substance abuse, promiscuity, and violence has absolutely nothing to do with rock 'n roll. You don't need to be self destructive to rock. Try to avoid the rockstar cliches and stop destructive behaviors before they turn into a serious problem.

, If you want to get rocking in a more formal setting, picking up an instrument can be a big step, signaling your evolution from rock fan to full-on rockstar in training. If you want to start a band, consider picking up up one of the following traditional rock instruments:



Guitar. To complete your transition from Jedi-in-training to full blown Skywalker, pick up the rock axe of stardom. Nothing is more wrapped-up in the style and soul of rock and roll than the electric guitar. Only one question remains: Stratocaster or Les Paul?

Bass. A few notable exceptions aside, a band without a bass guitar is like a meal without a plate. It just helps everything stay together. Providing a bottom end and a rhythmic foundation for the tunes, picking up bass will have you in high-demand as a player.

Drums. The drummer is the wild one behind the kit, slapping the skins and keeping everyone in time. Though it's one of the most satisfying instruments to play, drummers must have a natural sense of rhythm and internal time to be good. Are you up to the challenge?

, Clean out the garage, set up your amps, and warn the neighbors: it's time to start a band. Start spreading the word that you're looking for some rock and roll mercenaries for your newly minted pirate ship. Suit up in your jean jackets and your ratty sneakers and start changing the world three chords at a time.


Hang up a flyer with your contact info at the local guitar shop or music store if you're struggling to find willing players. Hit up open-mics at coffee shops or bars in your area and show off your skills to attract some attention and get people who'll want to play with you.
Classic indie rock band the Pixies was formed when Black Francis put a notice in the local paper that he wanted a bass player who liked both Peter, Paul, and Mary as well as Husker Du. If you can, make a demo of yourself playing and share it online to help find others to play with. Put the word out and keep your ear to the underground.

, When you first get started rocking, keep your expectations low and make your biggest priority getting on the same page. Tune up together, Try to play in time, and listen to what everyone else is doing. Start playing by jamming on a single chord or a single chord progression before you start trying to get fancy. Communicate together and try not to worry too much about whether or not it sounds great.


Most bands don't start out by writing their Bohemian Rhapsody. It's ok if you don't have your opuses in place when you first get started. Learn some cover songs first to help yourselves get used to playing together before you challenge yourselves to start actually writing music. Have fun with it at first.
Keep the volume at a reasonable level. Try not to get kicked out of your practice space before you even get a song together. Turn down so everyone can follow at a reasonable volume. If you think you hear trumpets going off above your guitar feedback, you're probably doing some hearing damage. Turn it done.

, When asked why he and his band played with such a chugging drive at such a slow tempo, one of the things that made his music completely fresh, unique, and listenable, Johnny Cash replied, ""We'd play faster if we could."" The toughest thing about forming a band? Finding a ""unique"" sound. Everyone wants it, but few bands actually achieve it. If you want your band to stand out from the crowd, learn to embrace your idiosyncrasies, faults, and quirks in your playing and your style as a band and make that the basis of your sound. Use your weaknesses as strengths.


Miles Davis could never master the technique of playing with vibrato, so he just quit trying altogether, and became iconic in part because of his long, clear, clean tones. If something gives you fits, embrace the other aspects of your playing. If you notice yourself relying on hammer-ons constantly during your guitar playing, make it your thing.
One of the oldest adages in rock is that if you can't play well, you should at least play fast, and that if you can't play fast, you should play loud. It holds up.

, If you stumble across a unique little pattern, or a catchy little hook in one of your jam sessions, it might be time to start writing a song. Where do you start? You don't have to be Shakespeare to write a rock song, and it's usually better to keep your expectations low and local when it comes to lyrics. Focus on your own life and write about what you know than trying to write abstract nonsense about ""society"" or politics. Keep it simple.


Study poetry and invest in a good rhyming dictionary to help your lyric skills. Try to write as a group, switching lines to help keep it democratic if you want. Some writers find it helpful to make up the melody first by singing nonsense syllables over the song and putting words to it later.
Alternatively, go wild. Do a William Burroughs-style cut up, throwing little fragments of cut-up newspapers into a hat and pulling things out at random. The Stones used to write songs this way. Or do the Led Zeppelin thing and climb into the misty mountains of Mordor to find your inspiration in fantasy, D&D, and other nerdery. Rock songs don't have to make sense or be ""cool,"" they just have to rock.

Add a strap to wear the mask.",How to Make a Mick Thomson Slipknot Mask," If you make the mask base using the instructions in this section, you'll have a mask that conforms to your face, letting you concentrate on building the Mick Thomson mask shape on top of it. You could skip this section instead, and purchase a plastic face mask from a craft stores or toy shop. If you do this, take notes on which areas of the mask are too small for you.This will help guide you as you build on top of the base.


If you have a friend to help you, you can make a plaster mask instead of either of these options.;
, Lay out eight to ten layers of aluminum foil on top of each other, in a rectangle large enough to cover your whole face.This may seem like a lot of aluminum, but a thinner stack is likely to tear before you're finished making the mask.


Since the Mick Thomson mask has a tall, exaggerated jaw, use a sheet of foil that extends past your chin to give yourself more room to work with.

, If the foil is smooth, crumple it slightly to give it a texture, then flatten it out again. Pushing in from the sides to make a few peaks in the foil should be enough; you don't need to crumple it into a ball.

, Press the foil over your whole face. Press down onto each of your features to turn the foil into a 3D outline.

, Cut the eye holes first, so you can look through the mask into a mirror and use a sharpie to mark where the mask needs to be cut next. In addition to the eye holes, make the following cuts:


Cut a flat line high above the forehead. If you don't have long hair like Mick Thomson, you might want to use a more rounded line around your forehead.
Cut the mask into two pieces. Cut the foil in half along the upper lip. This gives you more control over the shape of each section.

, Put on the top half of the mask and press the foil in under the nose, around your nostrils. Sculpt the lower half to the sides of your jaws, but extend the chin down in a narrowing rectangle, to roughly mimic Mick Thomson's mask.

, Use masking tape to keep the layers of aluminum together around the entire outline of your face. Tape the two halves of the mask back together again, now that the nose and jaw are sculpted more accurately. Continue on to the next section to start building your face mask into something worthy of a Slipknot concert.

, Purchase plaster cloth, or plaster tape, from a crafts store. Put a layer of newspaper over a table to catch spills, then lay out your mask base, a cup of water, and the plaster cloth. Keep the water in between the two objects, or off to the side, so you don't drip over the plaster cloth you haven't used yet.


You can use homemade papier mâché instead, but plaster cloth is usually easier to work with and less messy.

, Gently dip the cloth in water, then wipe it against the edge of the cup as you pull it out.This technique makes it less likely to bunch in on itself, and removes excess moisture that can make a mess and increase the drying time.


Cool or room temperature water is recommended, since warm water may make the plaster cloth stiffen up faster., Lay the wet strip of plaster cloth at any position on your mask base. Rub it onto the surface, until the strip is smooth and the fibers have flattened out along your base mask surface.If the strip is drying out before it is smooth, add a dab more water with your fingertips.
If water is pooling on your mask, soak it up with a paper towel. Try to use less water for the next strip, since the plaster can wash away and become less effective.
If the cloth rips or leaves loose strings, cut the fray off.

, Add more plaster cloth to the entire mask base surface. Repeat until you have a covering two or three layers deep. Once this dries, you'll be able to remove it from the foil base and use it as a sturdier, more comfortable mask.

, Use an awl or hole punch to punch a hole on each side of the mask, above the ears, so you'll be able to wear it. Cut two small holes for your nostrils. Let this dry until it no longer feels cold to the touch.If you are using a store-bought mask, see the next step for an additional instruction before you continue to the next section.

, This step is only necessary if you are using a store-bought mask base, instead of a mask base you made to fit your face. Before the plaster has dried, bend the areas of the mask that are too small for your face, such as the nose or chin. Crush the partially dried plaster in these areas, and use new wet strips of plaster cloth to extend the mask into a shape that you can wear.

, It's time to turn this generic mask into Mick Thomson's terrible visage. Keep several pictures of Mick Thomson's mask handy so you have something to base your design on as you work.


Mick Thomson has gone through several mask designs. Pick your favorite and use reference pictures of that model, or you might confuse yourself looking at multiple different designs.

, In most Mick Thomson masks, the bridge of the nose is raised and rectangular, and the sides are also flat and angled out sharply. You can make this using plaster cloth strips as before, but you can save time and reduce the masks' weight by building a rough base of this design using corrugated cardboard squares. Tape them on top of each to imitate this design. Cover them with plaster cloth as before, until no cardboard is visible.

, This portion of the mask is also made of flat, angled sections. Build up the cheekbones with overlapping strips, making them thicker toward the front. Make a significant angle change between the cheekbones and the cheeks, by building up the top of the cheeks beneath the cheekbones, then pressing them into a sharp angle.

, Use triangular strips of plaster cloth, pinched together at the wide end, to build the vertical strips of ""metal"" between the mouth vents.

, You can continue making as many adjustments as you like, to imitate the furrowed brow, the raised eyelid corners, or other features that have shown up on some Mick Thomson masks. Remember, when using plaster cloth, you are building up on top of the mask. To make a furrow, you'll have to build the plaster cloth around it, as you did with the mouth vents. You can also leave these finer details until the steps below.

, As before, let the mask dry until it is no longer cool to the touch. Since there are now thick sections of plaster, this could take several days, depending on climate conditions and how wet the plaster was.

, Use a paint brush to cover the mask with metallic silver paint. After this coat has dried, use a black or dark grey to fill in the ""holes"" in the mouth vent, and to make the furrows around the eyes, cheekbones, and cheeks more obvious. Continue on once this paint has also dried.


Optionally, you can mix streaks of grey paint into the silver to make a ""grittier,"" less shiny mask.

, Tie a heavy string through each hole on the side so you can wear the mask. To put it on, tie the other ends of the strings together around the back of your head.

Go to a concert.,
Buy a Meet and Greet Package ticket.,
Bring merchandise you'd like signed or a question you'd like to ask.,
Wait by the bus.",How to Meet One Direction1," The most common way to meet the band is to wait until they come to your area, purchase a ticket, and get backstage. Go to the One Direction website and read the events to find out when are they coming to a town near you.;
, On their future tours, One Direction offers a backstage package that includes a brief meeting and opportunity for photos with the band. This variety of ticket comes with regular passes for the show in any area of the hall, and the backstage portion of the evening.

, If you get the chance to meet the band, make sure you have a specific thing you'd like to talk about or something you'd like signed. You might freeze up from being star-struck, so it helps to have something pre-planned.

, If you can't afford the backstage pass ticket, it's common for groups of fans to wait around after the concert between the exit doors and the band's tour bus. Make sure you obey all the rules of the venue and leave if security asks you to. If the band is feeling up to it, they may sign a few autographs or take a few pictures outside the venue before they leave back to the hotel.


If you can find out where the band is staying in town, you can also wait outside their hotel and see if you can get a chance at meeting the band.

Check for book signings.,
Visit award shows or television performances.,
Sign up for the One Direction newsletter.",How to Meet One Direction2," Sometimes, One Direction have book signings at WHSmith or Waterstone. If you have the money to buy a book and get it signed, you can go wait in line and maybe get a photo.

, If you can't make it to a concert, try to get into the crowd when they perform on morning talk shows or on MTV performances and hang out outside.

, The fan club will keep you updated on concert opportunities in your area, and might even clue you into some meeting possibilities and VIP ticket packages that aren't made available for regular fans.

Find out when they're recording.,
Hang out in their neighborhood.,
Find out where they might be going on tour.",How to Meet One Direction3," People don't typically hang out around the recording studio, and you might have some trouble getting close by the kinds of studios the boys record in, but if you can find out when and where they've got studio time booked, you might be able to meet them when they're taking a break.

, Most of the band members live in London, which means that you can up your chances of meeting them if you hang out in the neighborhoods they hang out in.


Harry Styles has a condo in London, Louis Tomlinson has a house in North London, and Liam Payne has apparently been shopping for houses in the Primrose Hill sections of London. If you can find out where they live specifically, you can visit coffee shops or other hangouts nearby and hope to spot them.

, By keeping up with all the latest fan details, you can stay one step ahead of other fans and hope to run into the boys when they head out for a bite to eat on tour or go clubbing.

Keep motivated.",How to Survive Womad Festival,";
, Go for an extra special shopping extravaganza during which you purchase all the essentials for an extreme WOMAD experience. Buy such items as food, alcohol, wet wipes and dry shampoo.

, Check out the dates that you buy them as in some cases, the closer to the festival date you purchase the tickets the cheaper they are. You could always drive of course in which case, invest in a map. If you live next to the festival or fairly nearby then just have fun okay, and skip to step four.

, If there are several of you attending and between you you have several tents, put them in a circle with the entrances facing the middle. This way it's far more sociable. If you have one, perhaps place a gazebo in the middle. This is a good place to sit as people walking past may come and join you if you have made it all lovely and nice. It is always a good idea to have a tarpaulin to sit on for when the grass is wet in the morning and the evening then you still have somewhere to sit.

, Don't mix your drinks and try to be fairly sensible or you won't remember your truly fantastic WOMAD experience.

, Mornings may prove difficult at times, but keep pushing on. Showers are available but baby wipe washes and dry shampoo will suffice. Go and purchase a nice cold glass of orange juice and a slice of toast, or cook something up on a camping stove. Once you've got some food inside of you, you'll have plenty of energy to continue the day.

Wear practical clothing and footwear.,
Be cool.,
Moshing originated in the punk movement, and it definitely still goes on to this day.,
Crowd surfing and stage diving are dangerous, however some people choose to do this anyway.,
If you can't breathe, GET OUT.,
Stay hydrated.,
Guys AND girls: If someone's harassing you (verbally, physically, or sexually), tell the bouncers.,
Have fun.",How to Survive a Punk Show," Despite what you may think based on the looks of some punks, the movement isn't about fashion, so ladies, don't spend hours looking for the ""perfect outfit"" or putting on makeup, and guys, don't wear your ""favorite shirt"" or anything you don't mind getting beer and sweat on - and both of you, be prepared to have a shirt get ripped. These shows get very hot and sweaty after a while, and most of them stretch on in excess of three hours (most cities have a midnight - 2:00AM curfew though), so wear something that can breathe and not get ripped off easily. T-shirts, jeans/shorts, and good athletic shoes or boots are preferred. Tank tops, sandals, and skirts or baggy pants are not.;
, Whether you're talking to a bouncer, a band member, or another person in the audience, be polite and respectful. Strike up a conversation with someone between bands; who knows, you might find out about another cool band or even make a friend!

, If one begins to form, get out if you have no idea how to maneuver your way around in one. If you feel brave, however, know that it's mainly shoving and slamming into other people (slam-dancing) or running in a circle. Depending on the genre, some people (known as ""hardcore dancers"") will swing their arms and kick to the rhythm of the music. In all of these cases, nobody is intentionally hurt, and if you fall or want to get out, people will help you out. If you wish to leave, make your intentions known to the people at the ""wall"" of the pit by making a T shape with your hands to express your wish for ""time out"", otherwise, you may be mistaken for a slam-dancer trying to approach the wall and will be shoved back as a result. Do not take offense if this happens; just try to leave elsewhere.

, If you get hurt, it's nobody's fault but your own, since nobody forced you to do it. That being said, if you wish to crowd-surf, make sure that the people around you are cool with it, make sure your wallet, keys, and phone are someplace safe (to prevent them from being stolen) and keep your feet above people's heads. If you're a girl, you may get groped by a jerk in the audience; the people around them will usually retaliate for you, so don't go blindly kicking into where the person was. If you get dropped, try to protect your head and your back; your body can take an impact, but your brain and spine won't do that very easily. As for stage diving, don't stay onstage for more than three seconds, definitely do not touch the band members, and make sure that the audience will catch you. The bigger (height and weight wise) you are, the less likely they are to catch you. Other than that, just stick to the basics above.

, If you begin to feel dizzy or faint, get out of the crowd, get some water, and get into some fresh air. If you do pass out or even begin to get weak, you could lose footing and be crushed under the rest of the crowd. This has happened before (most infamously at a concert by The Who in Cincinnati and at a Smashing Pumpkins gig in the 90's), and you don't want it to happen to you.

, If water isn't free (it usually is at punk shows), conserve it as much as possible. If it's free, drink at least two glasses between bands or when you get tired, and maybe pour a little over your head to cool off if you feel hot enough.

, Retaliation will get you thrown out at best or assaulted at worst, so let the big guys do their job.

, Jump around like a maniac, scream until your voice goes out, go to school/work the next day with bruises and five hours of sleep, and have some good memories for the future.

Now that the concert is ""done"", what you do next is all up to you.",How to Survive an ICP Concert," They are sold online, but if you are unlucky/lucky, you could buy them at the show.;
, ICP concerts usually have a block-wide line before the show starts and the doors open, so do something to amuse yourself. The good news is the lines are quite fun, with chanting, yelling, photo-taking, and more.

, ICP shows are usually general admission, so there aren't any seats. Find your spot on the seating floor or balcony and wait.

, If you don't want to, you could go somewhere else and talk to friends, buy some stuff at the merchandise booth, or (if you are legal drinking age and have a wristband) go to the bar.

, It's sure to be crazy with music, soda flying everywhere, and random surprises (the band crowd surfing, videotaping, wrestling on stage, streamers, or more!)

, They usually continue spraying Faygo until a few minutes after the last song is over.

, You can chill with your friends, go home, go to an after-party (at Hallowicked,) or go to the bar until it closes.

Make sure that you are clean.,
Dress appropriately.,
Be prepared.,
Arrive early.,
Check the schedule.,
Go to your favourite band's stage early.,
Figure out whether you can handle the mosh pits.,
Stay hydrated.,
Try to meet the band.",How to Survive Warped Tour," You'll get sweaty and gross, so the least you can do is take a shower and put some body spray on. If you have long hair it's a good idea to wear a ponytail since your hair will get sweaty and will be in your face.;
, Wear sneakers to help protect your feet because you'll get stepped on in mosh pits. Girls should wear shorts instead of skirts, as skirts may fly up if you're jumping around. Leave the earrings, necklaces, or loose things at home as they will get ripped, pulled, or broken. Wear glasses in mosh pits at your own risk; they could get broken as well. Also, if you're wearing plugs or other loose jewellery it's a good idea to take them out in mosh pits or at least tighten them before you go in Remember to consider the weather - if you wear pants and it's hot out, it will make for a sweaty and uncomfortable day. If the forecast calls for a sunny day, it'd be a good idea to wear sunglasses. No matter what the weather, always wear sunblock because you're outside all day and it's easy to get burned even if it's cloudy. Don't forget to put it on top of your head and ears.

, Bringing the right items with you to Warped Tour can make the day go a lot more smoothly. It's important that you pack all of your stuff in a backpack or secure bag of some sort, because having to put all of your items in your pockets or carry a bunch of loose items around all day gets annoying and in the way. Make sure that your bag closes fully so nothing will fall out and so nobody can stick their hands in it to steal something from you. Some good items to bring are:


Money for the ticket and merchandise.






Paper and pen to write down the schedule.






Several water bottles.






A fully charged cell phone.






A fully charged camera (or an extra battery).






Sunblock and sunglasses.






Ponytail holder to hold your hair back.






Hand sanitizer or wipes.






Bug spray.






Sharpie (sometimes the band members don't have one).







, Make sure to get to Warped Tour early, so you can get inside right when the gates open at 11 am. Arriving early will give you enough time to look at the grounds and memorize where certain places, such as the stages, information booths, and restrooms, are located.


Try to go to all the booths. Most booths give out free items such as CDs and pins, and the Monster Energy Station gives away free Monster drinks.
Arriving early will also give you the best selection at the merchandise booths. The booths usually sell shirts, sunglasses, shorts, CDs, etc. Buying merchandise is a good idea because you can't get a lot of those things in stores and sometimes the band will be selling their own merchandise.

, It is a big wall with all the stage names that have the bands and the times. Instead of running back and forth to see who is playing when, bring a piece of paper and pen with you to write everything down, or write it down on your phone. Sometimes they sell schedules at the front, so you could buy one there if that's easier.

, Give yourself a lot of time to get to the stage they're playing at so that you can get a good spot before they start. How early to get there depends on how popular they are, so use your best judgement. Secure your spot and make sure you're able to see the band and that you aren't surrounded by people who could obstruct your view or get rough., Mosh pits can differ depending on what band is playing. For example, if it's a metal band, a circular pit will usually form in the center where people like to dance hardcore. Mosh pits are intense, so prepare to be rubbed up against a lot of sweaty people, including some greasy shirtless guys. If you can't take a pit, don't be in one. If you get in and then decide that they're not for you, or you accidentally get pushed in, edge away as fast as you can. If you feel like you're about to pass out or someone is about to crush you, put your arms in front of you and leave the pit through the side, saying ""excuse me"" as you go.

, Mosh pits combined with hot weather will wear you out and make you sweat, so staying hydrated is super important! Water can get expensive, so be sure to bring your own water bottle. You will be able to fill it up whenever you need to. Many venues will not allow you to bring an open water bottle into the grounds, so ensure that your bottle's seal hasn't been broken yet, otherwise they might just throw it away. Also, avoid freezing your water bottle as frozen ones might be taken away as well. If your bottle gets taken away, find the Medical Tent and tell them you feel dehydrated. Most of the time they will give you a free bottle of water. As desperate as you might be for water, don't accept a drink from anyone except venue staff - you never know what that person might have put in it.

, There are casual signings where you can have a brief moment with them, or you can try to meet them in front of the gates where their buses unload. If you are not allowed through the gate, this means that only the performers are allowed, and they will go through at some point (usually after they play, when they're going to get food, or when they've finished eating).


If you do meet a band stay calm. Avoid screaming, crying, or jumping up and down. Just walk up to them and say hi, and they will most likely say hello back. If they appear to be in a hurry, be as brief as possible and ask them for a quick picture, hug, or a signature. If they stay and talk to you, have a genuine conversation with them. Ask if they're enjoying themselves and what future events they're playing at. Don't brag about how big a fan you are. Instead, say something that will make them laugh, smile, or remember you in a good way.

Go to the concert venue a day or two before the show.,
Take note of the various entrances.,
Chat up the bouncers or security guards.",How to Sneak Into a Concert1," It is best to familiarize yourself with the surroundings as much as possible. You don't want to be confused and wandering around when it is time to make your move. If you know where you're trying to go it won't look like you are attempting to sneak inside.;
, Look for alternate entrances the band and crew might use to access the venue. These can be easier to get inside than the main entrance.


Check any perimeter fences at larger venues. Look for any spots that are ideal to climb over or go under to get inside. There may even be a back gate or entrance that will provide easier access.

, You may be able to make a friend and get them to sneak you into the concert.At the very least you can take the opportunity to talk about your upcoming gig here. That way when you attempt to sneak in the next day, the security guard may see your familiar face going past and not think anything about it.


Listen for codes and clues to help get you in. If someone walks in while you're chatting pay attention to any things they say or names they might mention to get inside. Find out if they have a guest list, and the name of the person in charge of the guest list. The more you seem to know if you're caught, the better off you'll be.
Some buildings have doors with keypad locks. If you see one, try to keep an eye out and catch someone using the code.

Arrive early for the concert.,
Climb a fence.,
Impersonate a roadie.,
Wear adhesive wristbands.,
Walk in with a large crowd.",How to Sneak Into a Concert2," You may even want to arrive the day before while the staff is setting up at a large concert venue. You might be able to slip in unnoticed and hide under a truck or stage. Musicians usually arrive earlier in the afternoon at smaller venues to load their gear and perform a sound check. Security is pretty low before the concert, so getting in early is often your best chance at success.

, Big music festival venues usually have large, high fences. You may need to bring in a tall ladder to even have a chance at getting over. You can try to rig up a rope ladder to draw less attention to yourself. If you do make it over without injury, be prepared to run away from security and try to lose them in a crowd.


Climbing over a high fence is not easy or safe. You could fall or get injured, which will also mean getting caught.

, Look like a roadie by carrying an empty guitar case, walkie talkies, and papers that could pass for set lists or event schedules.


Wear an ID badge. Have a forged ID ready if possible to identify you as 'crew.' Most security guards don't look closely at them and you might be able to get past. Be careful though, if caught with false credentials you could be charged with a crime.

, Many large concerts give out wristbands to ticket holders that allow them to get in and out of the venue. Save your old concert wristbands to try and find one that looks similar enough to get you inside. If you are at large outdoor venue, you can have someone inside remove their wristband, attach it to a rock or water bottle, and throw it over the fence to you.Then you can put it on and calmly stroll inside.

, Go for it. Don't turn back, don't hesitate. When there's a break, go for the doors as stealthily as possible. You're best off to wait for a distraction before trying. If you need to, make the distraction yourself. Tell the security there is a fight going on around the corner, or get a friend to ask a security guard some questions while you try to slip by him.

Wear dark, casual clothing.,
Act natural.,
Head to your destination.",How to Sneak Into a Concert3," The less attention you draw to yourself the better.If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong.

, If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on. Play it cool. You can try to look busy or bored. If you want to fit in, it should seem like it's just another day at the office for you.


Talk like you belong. If a crew member walks by, casually say hello. A simple nod works well, too. Don't overdo it and end up drawing their attention. If they stop you and question you, laugh it off. Then tell them you work at the venue, or you're with the band.
Make eye contact. Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you aren't doing anything wrong, the better the chance you have.

, Don't stop or slow down too much. Keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. Watch where the staff and band members go and observe what they do. Pick up on it and follow like you belong there. By watching enough people, you'll figure out how to blend in and seem inconspicuous.

",How to Survive a General Admission Floor," Jeans or shorts are the basics and that's probably what everyone else will be wearing. Make sure nothing you wear is too short or tight, as you don't want to be mistaken for a groupie. Skirts are acceptable, but it all depends on the show and how brave you are. If you do wear a skirt, make sure it's not a micro-mini and wear opaque(solid) tights underneath to avoid any peeks at what you don't want to be seen. T-shirts of any kind are the best to wear, and maybe a tank if you're up for it.;
, Flip-flops, sandals, heels, and huge boots are a mistake. Wear some sort of sneakers (i.e. Vans, Converse, Nike) to not only protect your feet, but keep them from hurting by the end of the night. Remember that you'll be standing up for four or more hours (depending on who you're seeing) and you don't want blisters later on.

, If you want the best vantage point at the venue, don't arrive half an hour before the show begins. Since there aren't seats, it's a first come, first served situation. If you're a real stickler about getting right at the stage, get there about six to seven hours early. Really. And don't be that person who pushes through to the front when everyone else has been there the whole day. You'll just get screamed at and told to go to the back.

, Make sure wherever you are in the crowd that you keep your feet a shoulder's width apart. That way, you'll have a little space for yourself and won't get off balance when the crowd moves. Plus, if a friend has to go to the restroom, you can leave a little room for them without being obnoxious.

, If someone pushes, kicks, or elbows you, keep a cool head. Though it may be a knee-jerk reaction to retaliate, don't. You can get kicked out or start a brawl that no one wants to happen. And be sensible about it. If you can tell that they're not doing it on purpose, don't get angry. They might be distracted.

, If you've been there for hours keeping your spot and someone comes and stands about an inch away from you(because this will definitely happen, especially with younger ones and people who are new), kindly ask them to either move to the front or to the back. Most likely, they'll realize they're being rude and move on. If they don't, don't shove them, just speak with a firm, authoritative voice.

, You know that there are people at the show who have been to 20+ concerts and know the rules. Be respectful and don't act like you deserve the best spot. If someone asks you to to move for a real reason, not just because they can't see or something that they can adjust, be courteous and move.

, Nothing is worse than Paul Bunyan over there blocking your vision. If you are standing behind someone extremely tall, either move or politely ask them to move if you can't. And if you are the really tall person that blocks people from seeing the stage, move to the back or to the side.

, With whatever is happening onstage, don't get distracted by your surroundings. You came there to have a good time and to see some bands you love, so enjoy it and have fun. Keep your eyes on the band playing and follow according to what they're doing and what the rest of the audience is doing. Even if you're not a huge fan of one of the opening bands and are only there for the headliner, don't be rude and just stand there. Try to be involved as much as you can.

, Remember that a General Admission show is bound to have its ups and downs and changes. Things can happen, things can go wrong, people can get injured. Stay aware while you're in the crowd and watch out for yourself as well as your friends. If you can see that they're getting pushed around by someone, help them out and they'll do the same for you. Also, be courteous to the bands. No matter if this is your first time or not, never do anything to make their night uncomfortable. Remember that they're here to have a good time, too, not just you. Plus, they want to you to have a good time and get engaged in what's going on onstage.

Make sure that you have room to breathe.,

If you have no choice but to be swept up by the crowd, make a cage around your chest with your arms to protect your ribs and your breathing, then use one foot at a time on the ground to keep yourself upright.

At the end of the concert, try not to get in anyone's way.",How to Stay On Your Feet at Concerts," If you only have one foot properly on the floor, you will be easier to knock over.;
, Not only will you have better balance, but there's a much better chance that you'll keep a little space between you and everyone else. Stand your ground.

, If you are at the very front, place your hands on the barrier and don't let go.

, It doesn't matter if they think you are a freak because of this next step. Shift one of your feet so that it is firmly in between theirs. This will make it easier for you to steady yourself if you are pushed.

, A simple way to ensure this, is by bending both of your arms out in front of you, and resting your wrists against the back of the person in front of you. This allows your chest room, and so nobody will be able to crush you.

, If you do, it is very likely that you will lose your balance, and an excited fan will knock you over. Make sure that, if you do go with the push, that you keep your arms out, and your feet flat on the floor.

,, That way, you can jump higher, and be sure to land on the ground.

, Hold hands, or link arms with he people you went with, and walk to the exit.

Meet bands!",How to Survive a Warped Tour Concert," You don't want to be tired all day long, you won't enjoy the concerts as much and chances are, you're going to get crabby out in the heat.;
, This is very important. The temperature is going to be extremely high, all day. Warped tour is crowded, there's sweaty people everywhere. The best thing you can do is shower. If your hair is long, it'd be a good idea to put it in a ponytail, otherwise it'll stick to your neck, forehead, and back all day. Another good plan, is wear sunblock! You're under direct sunlight all day long, you don't want to look like a lobster.

, Think about the weather, it's almost always going to be over 90 degrees. It's probably not the best idea to wear pants or a long sleeve shirt. If you're a girl, dresses and skirts aren't a good plan unless you wear shorts underneath, especially if you're going to mosh. Flip flops and sandals, also not a good idea. Even if you don't mosh, crowded shows are going to be packed, people will step on your feet. Earrings, necklaces, or any loose jewelry shouldn't be worn. It could get pulled at or broken.

, Consider not only the drive, but also if you have to stop for gas. You'll have to wait in line to get into the parking lot, the earlier you're in that line, the closer parking spot you'll get. The parking lot opens around 8. Then you wait in line at the gates, which open at 11. You want to be pretty far up in line to have time to check out where everything is.

, Get a basic idea of where all the stages are, bathrooms, places to get waters, etc. Also, check out the schedule, it should be right near the gates on a big wall of some sort with all the band names and times they'll play. Write down when everyone's playing or buy a printed schedule for a couple dollars near the gate.

, If they're a bigger band, you'll want to be up closer, so get there a few minutes earlier than they start playing. Realize that you'll have to sacrifice seeing some bands, to see others play. Make sure that when you have spare time, you map out which bands you want to see more than others.

, If you want to mosh, know what you're doing. If you don't want to, be assertive and get out. Stay near edges and away from the mosh. If you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or crushed, push your way out of the mosh pit.

, It's better to go with at least one other person, so you don't have to waste time meeting up with everybody when you're there. It's a good idea to stay with at least one person all day, in case you're feeling sick, get hurt, etc.

, Some booths give out free things like stickers, pins, CDs, sunglasses, bracelets, etc. They're always nice and sometimes give you discounts on different things, or give you free items for buying something. Some booths have contests to win free things, and some let you listen to their band so it's a good chance to hear new bands that aren't that big yet.

, It's a lot easier than it sounds. Sometimes you can see different members of bands walking around, seeing bands, or at the booths. You can also see them at the front at the gate, normally whenever they're done playing. A couple bands normally do signings, and if they do, you want to be one of the first people in line, so try to get there fast. You can get something signed and a chance to meet them. If they look busy, don't bother them much. Ask for a quick picture or signing. If they're busy, don't try to converse with them way too much, you'll annoy them. If they want to stay and talk, don't ask for them to give you something, don't ask overly personal questions, don't ask for kisses or anything like that. You can give them a gift or ask nicely for a hug. Do not cry or freak out, it's going to freak them out. Act nice and casual, and they'll be nice back.

, If kids are coming with you, have them at your side at all times. Children get lost very, very easily at these things and your child/children getting lost can be a very traumatic experience. But if you do get lost, make sure you report it to one of the festival tents; these should be located in several places around the grounds. Also, a good tip is to write your mobile/cell phone number on your child's arm so if someone can ring you if they find your child.

",How to Sneak a Camera Into a Concert," Is it your average point-and-shoot pocket camera? If so, there's a chance it will be allowed inside. Check before taking measures to sneak it in.;
, Most cameras now are going for a thin feel and look, and this works to your advantage. Fatter cameras are generally not as tall; use the dimensions to help you feel out places it can go.

, It can be in a pocket, purse, concealed in clothing or strapped to your body. Here are a few methods.


Wear a large, baggy sweatshirt with nothing underneath (this is particularly effective if you are female).Use your camera's strap or strap from somewhere else to sling it over your shoulder. Secure it so it hangs right in the pit of your back where it curves in before your buttocks. Put your sweatshirt on over it. If the guards ask you to remove your sweatshirt, lift the front up a bit to show them that you can't, as you have nothing on underneath.
Take your purse (or the purse of a female accompanying you, if you are male). Either cut out the lining on the bottom, or find material like it and cut a piece that fits. Lift it and place your camera in the bottom. Fill the remaining space with soft material, both to protect your camera and solidify the bottom again. Replace the lining. Throw some tampons on top. Most bouncers will not dig around very thoroughly.
Wear a somewhat baggy long sleeve shirt. If your camera is small enough, strap it with some tape or a strap to your underarm. Be warned, if you are going to an establishment with a gun threat, you are likely to be frisked and this is easily found through touch.
Crotch it. Similar to the underarm technique, wear baggy pants and strap it to your inner thigh, very close to your private area. There's a very good chance you won't be searched thoroughly here. If you are a female, wear a mid-length fluffy skirt. Not only will you not be touched there, a skirt looks open enough to allay suspicion, though it conceals very well. You can also unbutton your pants, hang your camera from your button, and then re-button your pants. Then simply slip the camera down into your pants and let it hang. It may be uncomfortable,but holds your camera securely and you don't have to worry about it being found, even if you're frisked.
If you have a small and thin wallet, empty most of your wallet and tape it to the inside of the wallet. Keep your wallet in a large pocket and if frisked, when they ask what's in your pocket, immediately say its just your wallet. If you do this you should get in fine.
If you're using a professional grade camera with a lens, this may work for you. You'll need a friend. Take your camera, a separate body you won't be shooting with, and two lenses. Have your friend conceal one lens well and one lens very conspicuously, so that it will be found with a simple search. Do the same with your two camera bodies. Have your friend go first. When the lens is found, have them give it up obligingly and apologize to you, where you will step up, possibly curse or look abashed, and hand over your dummy camera body. These will be tagged for pickup after the show, and it is unlikely they will search you for a second camera. The same can be done with small pocket cameras. Conceal your real one well, and then use a disposable or cheap other camera as your dummy.
Ladies: Fluff and tease your hair up to a nice volume. Get a poofy sort of hat, like the ones Britney Spears is fond of. Pull some of your hair into a poof on top of your head, and conceal your camera inside. Top it off with your big hat and you're good to go. This is also easily reversed once inside, so you don't have to walk around with bad hair. Security may ask you to remove your hat though, counteracting this technique.
Use your gloves. Get one pair of gloves, and a third of the same or a similar type. Place your camera inside one glove, and wear the other two. When in line, place your camera glove someplace inconspicuous but where you might set your gloves normally. When in plain sight of a bouncer, or right before being searched, obviously take your gloves off and place them on top of the third, then pick them up in one hand or set them on the table with your jacket and umbrella, or something of the sort. Then when you have been searched, pick up your gloves, tip your hat, and enjoy the show.

, I doubt that the guard would ask you to take off your shoes. When in there, go into the bathroom and take the camera out of your shoe; put the camera in one of your pockets or any other easily-accessible area and enjoy the show.

, Go through the whole process with the guard and get in. During the concert, play, show, etc. rip open the seam and take out the camera.

, Be apologetic and act ignorant.

, if the guard asks to see your bag give it to them most guards don't check in the hoodie. Put in some cash, a phone, etc. to make it look inconspicuous.

Head to your destination.,
Talk like you belong.,
Ask someone casually what to do, as a last resort, if all else fails.",How to Sneak Backstage at a Concert1," The less attention you draw to yourself the better. If possible, pick up attire similar to what the crew is dressed in so you look like you belong.;
, If you start freaking out and talking about how excited you are to see the band, people will begin to catch on.

, Don't hang your head down or try to stay unnoticed. The more you act like you belong, the better the chance you have.

, Most security guards don't look closely at them and you will be able to get past if caught lurking around

, Don't stop, don't slow, keep moving like you know where you're going, even if you don't. By watching enough people, you'll figure it out sooner or later.

, If a crew member walks by, try to say hi to them or make a quick comment such as ""The band sure are hyped up tonight"" or ""Man, the fans are crazy.""

, But be smart about it. For instance if there's a code on the door, ""What's the code? I forgot it, AGAIN!"" or if you're in but not sure where to go, ""Shit, where's (name a band member) dressing room again? All these venues start to blend in after a while.""

Wear foam or silicone earplugs.,
Consider purchasing custom earplugs.,
Stand away from the speakers.",How to Protect Your Hearing at Concerts1," Foam and silicone earplugs are the most common means of hearing protection at concerts, and an effective method to block harmful levels of sound from your ears. Foam or silicone earplugs can protect you from serious hearing damage, and serve to block out harmful levels of sound.You can compress foam earplugs before you put them into your ears, and then they will expand to fill your ear canal. You can shape silicone earplugs to conform to the shape of your ears.
If you’re at a concert without earplugs, never improvise by stuffing tissues or wadded cotton balls into your ears.Not only will these materials fail at blocking sound, but they may cause physical damage to your ears if you shove the tissue or cotton in too deeply.
You can purchase earplugs at a grocery store, drugstore, or in larger stores, like Walmart or Target.;
, If you attend concerts frequently or would like earplugs that offer more protection than everyday foam earplugs, consider being measured for a pair of custom earplugs. These are designed to fit the dimensions of your ears, and are made of a higher-quality material that blocks a higher number of decibels.Another benefit of custom earplugs is that they will not simply mute all levels of sound (like foam earplugs will), but they’ll effectively filter the music so that you can still hear well and not feel like you’re listening to the concert from underwater.There are multiple business that create and sell custom earplugs. You can start looking for one of these companies with an online search: check out companies such as Radians, Ear Peace, and Decibulls.

, Regardless of the type of earplugs you’re wearing, you’ll be at a greater risk of hearing loss if you stand right in front of the speakers and amplifiers, or right in front of the loud band. As a general rule, the back of the room will be quieter than the front. If you’re able to choose your own location at the concert, opt for a setting as far as possible from speakers and amps.Always sit at least 10 feet (3 meters) away from any speakers.
If you’re at a concert with assigned seating, consider purchasing seats farther away from the stage. As an additional benefit, these seats will likely be less expensive.

"
"
Make sure that you have been practicing to prepare for the concert.,
Practice with a metronome whenever possible, and set it to the tempo you will be performing at.,
Attend rehearsals.,
Make sure you have your wardrobe ready before the day of the concert.,
Have your instrument ready the day of the concert.,
Be on time to the concert so as to tune up your instruments with the group.,
Perform and enjoy it even if it is your first time.",How to Prepare to Perform in a Concert," The more you practice the more the music and the notes become easier to play.;
, You want to be at the right speed and not buzzing ahead or dropping behind, you and others would get confused!

, Go to every single rehearsal, or as many as you can to help your group get used to playing with each other.

, What you're wearing to perform is very important. You might have to wear something specific, such as a tuxedo. Get all this stuff before the day of the concert.

, Try not to do anything last minute, like changing the strings the day of the concert.

, Remember you are the ones in the concert, and not attending it.

, Have fun and do not think about how many people are watching you. Just make believe you are only practicing with the band. The audience usually claps no matter what.

"
Moderate the number of concerts that you attend.,
Give your ears time to recover after a concert.,
Protect your ears if you work at a concert venue.,
Be aware of the signs of hearing loss.,
Take hearing protection seriously.,
Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about hearing loss.",How to Protect Your Hearing at Concerts2," Even if you wear earplugs at every concert, you only increase the risk of hearing damage with every concert that you attend.Try to limit the number of concerts that you attend, and consider decreasing the number if you attend concerts frequently. If you attend over 12 shows a year, try cutting the number back to 5 or 6.


Drinking alcohol at concerts presents a further risk to your ears. Intoxicated individuals may not feel the painful effects of hearing damage, or may dull your sensitivity to the ringing in your ears.
For this reason, avoid intoxication at concerts. If you want to drink, do so moderately, and be sensitive to pain and ringing in your ears.

, If you’ve attended a loud concert, your ears have doubtless been exposed to loud sounds for an extended period of time. Even if you wore foam or custom ear plugs at the concert, it will help your ears recover to give them a “hearing detox.” This is a period of time during which you avoid all loud noises to give your ears time to recover from the concert. Give your ears about 16 hours without any exposure to loud sounds after every concert.When on a “hearing detox,” avoid listening to loud music—whether at live shows or through your headphones—and avoid loud construction zones, heavy traffic, and seeing movies in the theater. It may seem surprising that movies can damage your hearing, but many action films reach peak volume above 100 db.

, If you’re employed by an amphitheater, sports arena, jazz or rock club, or other type concert venue, you will frequently be exposed to potentially harmful levels of sound. Plan to purchase yourself a high-quality pair of custom earplugs as soon as possible; considering using a pair of earplugs similar to those that professional musicians use. Check out—online or in-person—the HealthDoc HiFi earplugs or LiveMusic HiFi earplugs.You may also decide to purchase a pair of over-the-ear hearing protectors to wear even when your earplugs are in. Avoid using foam earplugs, as these will provide inadequate protection to someone who works in a music venue., If you’ve ever been to a loud concert and afterwards (when in the quiet of your car driving home or in your bedroom that night) still heard a ringing sound in your ears, you’ve experienced hearing damage. This phenomena is called “tinnitus.” After the first several times you experience tinnitus, the ringing sound goes away after a while. However, tinnitus can develop into a permanent condition, which can diminish your hearing permanently.Having a full feeling in your ears may also be a sign of hearing loss. This may feel similar to the pressure feeling you get when you are flying on an airplane.
Ear discomfort after exposure to loud sounds, such as a concert can be another sign of hearing loss. This discomfort or painful sensation can include an aching deep inside your ears.

, Your ears are sensitive, delicate instruments that can be damaged when exposed to sound volumes higher than 85 decibels (db) for long periods of time. The volume at most concerts registers between 100 and 140 db, meaning that your hearing is at risk at nearly every show you attend.If you don’t take measures to protect your hearing, you risk causing permanent damage to your ear drums or to the fine hairs in your inner ear.

, Hearing loss is a serious issue, and its effects are irreversible. If you attend concerts frequently or are worried about your own hearing, talk to your doctor. Also you’re your doctor if you notice hearing-related symptoms, including: some sounds sounding louder or quieter than they usually do, you have to keep turning the TV and radio up, or if people’s voices sound slurred or indistinct.Your general-care doctor may refer you to an audiologist (ear specialist) if the doctor fears that you’ve already suffered from hearing damage. If you’re referred, set up this appointment immediately.

Research the music.,
Find a good campsite.,
Bring the right equipment.,
Keep your money safe.,
If you're alone, make friends.,
Make sure you feel safe.,
Forget about the outside world.",How to Prepare for a Music Festival," If you want to get to the front of the crowd for a certain band you love, you might have to see one or two of the bands in the line-up ahead of that band. You might be lucky enough to already know their music, but if you don't, it might be a good idea to research these artists and get to know their music. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it, if not, you make the decision to endure the music you may dislike. Even if you don't particularly like whichever band may be ahead, try to find a song that appeals to you by this band. This is a good idea to research the band because if not, you'll be standing in the middle of the crowd without a clue and when you may enjoy the atmosphere, you won't have as much fun as you could do if you listen to the music. It's always best to know the music.;
, Take time to find a camp suitable to you. If you love the wild nightlife and don't care about not getting much sleep, it's best to be out in the open and where everyone seems to be. If you prefer a quiet campsite, try to find a closed off field. Some campsite sections are lucky to have their own small field. If you find one, try to find a good spot in a small field. This way, it'll have less people, therefore quieter and, whether you feel safe to, you have more of an option to leave all of your belongings in your tent whilst you head off into the middle of the crowd.

, Of course, the obvious thing to bring is a tent. However, there are many things that would benefit you that you might not think to take. These are listed below in the ""Things You'll Need"" section.

, A lot of the time, if you take a debit card, you can take out money at the festival (there should be ATM machines there) although you will, most likely get charged. If you want to take cash with you, make sure you find a place on your person to keep it safe. The first place you would most likely think to keep it is in your bra. Don't! You'll be jumping up and down and moving around so much in the crowd it will fall out and get lost. A tip for you girls is to buy a cheap padded bra you won't intend on wearing much. Cut a line across the inside of the cup and sew a zip onto the split material. You'll have made yourself a zip pocket. If you keep your money inside, with the pocket zipped, you'll keep your money safe throughout the festival. You're not likely to take off your bra the entire time. If you're a guy, try to find an alternative piece of clothing that's either padded or with double material so you can cut through one layer.

, Music is only half of the enjoyment. If you make friends, you'll double your enjoyment. At festivals, the fun never stops but if you're on your own and don't make friends, it can be difficult to enjoy yourself. If you're shy, try to pluck up the courage to talk to people. Most of the people at festivals are often friendly, out to have a good time and you'll most likely find people talk to you at random. If you see and like the look of a few people enjoying a few beers at their camp, introduce yourself and ask if their having a good time. Before the festival, try to find someone who's also going and ask if you can camp along with them.

, If you're on your own in an overwhelming crowd, and don't feel safe, get out. You won't enjoy the artists performing, you'll be concentrating on trying to breathe and feel comfortable. It takes a lot of effort to be at the front of the crowd, particularly for a highly popular band, and it can be very overwhelming. If you feel like you can't handle it, don't panic. Just make your way out and find a spot that feels right for you.

, Festivals are one of the greatest forms of escapism. If you forget, you'll have the best time of your life. You most likely will forget instantly, there will be so much happening. Nothing matters on the outside; once you're in, that's all that matters. Enjoy yourself. Don't fuss if you haven't had a shower, don't be too bothered about having to pee outside and don't worry if you even get an ignorant hooligan deciding to throw a cup of urine in the crowd. In the end, you're messy anyway and you'll get nice and clean once you get home.

Use a proxy server.,
Buy tickets early.,
Choose a suitable price.There is much debate as to how much a scalper should charge for an upmarked event ticket.,
Sell via an generic online marketplace.,
Use a ticket resale website.Ticket resale websites, colloquially called ""fan-to-fan marketplaces"", have emerged specifically due to how much money there is to be made in ticket resale.,
Consider hidden fees.,
Track your profits.",How to Scalp Tickets1," Ticket scalping is most likely illegal where you live. Although the chances of you being caught are slim, you should look into getting a proxy browser like Tor if you're any bit worried. Proxies will block your IP address and make it difficult;
, If you're going to be using an online outlet to sell, you won't be doing yourself any services if you wait to strike. Keep your eye out for presales and wide-release sale dates.The sooner you buy tickets, the better tickets you'll have at your disposal. Better tickets will maximize the likelihood of being to sell them off to a potential customer.

, Ultimately, it depends on the original price, quality of seat, and predicted demand for the ticket in question. Generally speaking, if a show has sold out, it becomes a seller's market. Many professional scalpers tend to upmark resold tickets by 50%.Don't forget to factor in service fees (including fees from the online marketplace) into your final price.
If your ticket price is way over the face value on personal ad sites like Craigslist, you run the risk of getting your post flagged., You can sell tickets online as you would anything else. Websites like eBay and Craigslist are known hangouts for online scalpers although the police are wise to that now.Both of these sites allow the resale of tickets, and you can do so without incurring the major fees of ticket sites like StubHub.

, Websites like StubHub will allow you to post your tickets in a trusted setting.These marketplaces are helpful because they're relatively safe and the buyers on that site will be there specifically with what you're selling in mind.


A ticket resale website also allows you to browse your scalping competition more conveniently. If you're unsure how much you should mark up your ticket price, you can look up on what other scalpers are charging for the point of reference.

, If you're using an online marketplace like StubHub, you should keep in mind the fees you may incur.StubHub typically siphons 15% of your profits, plus a service charge. If you're selling enough tickets and cutting enough of a profit margin, this shouldn't be an issue. If you're a more small-time scalper however, you may be better off with using a site like Craigslist or selling the tickets in person.

, While scalping tickets in person tends to be a casual affair, purchasing and reselling tickets online for profit is more of a business than anything. Because the logistics are easier, you can think more about it in terms of supply-and-demand, market value and probability. With that in mind, keeping a spreadsheet of your profits and losses is essential for success in the long run.If your tickets are selling fast, you may want to buy more tickets next time. On the other hand, if you're not getting enough sales, you could lower your upmark a bit to attract customers.
Not everything will work the same for each category. Sports events may see different rates of success than an avant-garde metal concert. It may be a good idea to split your spreadsheet into different types of event. That way, you'll be able to see where the most money is."

Determine whether a show will sell out.,
Aim to buy higher quality tickets.,
Get to the venue early.,
Make sure the buyers have the cash beforehand.,
Be loud.,
Make the exchange.,
Lower your prices if necessary.",How to Scalp Tickets2," Especially if you're selling a ticket in person, you need to make relatively sure that there will be a demand for the upmarked tickets you're trying to sell. There is only a promise of demand if the event sells out. You can usually have a decent idea whether or not a show will sell out based on other shows that artist or team have put on. Look online to see if earlier events sold out.


Artists who charge the least for tickets are your best bet as a prospective scalper.It's a good idea to look up on the artist performing as well, specifically their history for pricing. Some artists may charge as much as they can for tickets, while others will purposefully undercharge with the hopes of capitalizing on merchandise sales once their customers are inside the venue., Unlike selling online, you are probably not going to be able to sell to a large amount of buyers while scalping in person. Realistically, a dedicated scalper may only sell to a few parties in one night, so it's important to make those sales count with higher quality tickets. Buy your tickets early, and make sure the tickets themselves are part of a tier that's bound to sell out fast.

, It doesn't hurt to get to the venue early. After all, fans who are desperate to get tickets aren't going to wait around to head over. For the highest demand events, you may have all of your tickets sold hours before the show starts. Getting to the venue will also give you a time to gain some selling momentum before the majority of ticket-holders show up and things begin to get chaotic.

, Because of the illegality of scalping tickets, you won't be able to go to the police if you're cheated by a prospective buyer. Before handing anyone your tickets, make sure they actually have the cash to pay for it.

, You don't exactly need to have a brilliant marketing scheme when it comes to scalping tickets, but you do need to make people aware that you're selling them. Be loud, and shout what you're selling. including the type and number of seats. You can repeat this information loudly. If there is a demand for what you're selling, people will eventually come up to you and ask.


For example, if you were selling great tickets to a sold-out Dream Theater concert, you could say something like this: ""Dream Theater, front row! Pair of tickets.""
You don't need to shout out the price as part of your repeated mantra. Some people who approach you may be more likely to accept a price once they've already opened a dialogue with you, as opposed to hearing a high price before approaching.

, Once the interested buyer has agreed to your price, its a simple matter of exchanging the tickets for the cash. The exchange itself should be fast and painless. There may be reason to be suspicious if the buyer is procrastinating or wasting time. In the vas majority of cases, buyers looking for scalped tickets are in a rush to get inside the venue, so an interaction shouldn't take very long once the price has been agreed upon.


Don't expect the buyer to show much in the way of gratitude. Scalpers are looked down on, and although they technically getting into a sold-out show because of you, the opportunism isn't going to get you into anyone's good graces., Like so many things in business, there is an element of financial risk in scalping tickets.Sometimes, a show will not sell out near as much as you thought you would. The tickets you are selling may not be quite as demanded as you had hoped for. If you're having bad luck, don't be afraid to lower your ticket prices. If there is no hope of selling them for a profit, you should cut your losses and sell the tickets at face value or below. It will be a defeat, but nowhere near as much as if you let the tickets go to complete waste.


On a brighter note, selling tickets at their face value is completely legal, so you won't have to worry about infringing upon the law if it turns out you have to lower your prices."

If you are concerned about the effect that earplugs may have on sound quality, you can purchase high fidelity earplugs that dial down the volume of the music rather than muffle it like foam earplugs tend to do. , What you wear will depend on the concert and venue type, but there are some basic strategies for concert dress that will help you as you decide what to wear.


Dress comfortably. Even if you have a seat, you’ll be on your feet a lot and you may even want to dance or mosh during the concert, so don't wear something that is extremely tight or difficult to move around in. Don’t over accessorize. A tried and true strategy to avoid over accessorizing is to take one accessory off before you leave your house.Account for the weather if you’ll be outside. If it’s going to be sunny and hot, wear a hat, sunglasses, and shorts. If it’s going to rain, bring a rain poncho. If it’s going to be cold, dress in layers. Think about what you’re going to be doing after the show. If you have plans to go out for drinks after the show, wear something that can take you from day to night. Wearing black, navy, or other dark tones is one way to accomplish a day to night look., (Posterboard, markers, glitter, etc.) Making your own sign is an easy, fun way to get psyched for the concert and it might even catch the attention of one of the band members., If you plan to buy a t-shirt, hoodie, or CD at the show, you will want to have plenty of cash on hand. Merchandise is usually expensive at concerts, but the revenue from merchandise goes straight to the performers unlike ticket sales and other aspects of the concert that are divided among multiple parties. , If you are planning to go to the concert with friends, decide who is going to drive in advance. If you need a ride, check out a rideshare service such as Uber or Lyft to see if they are available in your area. , Even if the concert will be inside, you will want to check on the weather to make sure that you will be comfortable while you are waiting in line to get into the concert.

, If you are driving or riding with a friend, find out what kind of parking is available. If you are going to an outdoor concert, see if you are permitted to bring any food/beverages into the venue with you.

, Plan out your sign design before you begin. Outline your design in pencil first and then go over it with marker. Decide whether you want to make a heartfelt sign or a funny one. , Put necessary items (TICKETS, lip gloss, ID, cash, earplugs, comb or pocket brush, etc.) in your wallet or purse the night before the concert. If you plan to bring a purse and you don’t have a small purse or wrist clutch, you may want to invest in one because you will not want to be lugging around a large purse all night.

, (Maybe even go out and buy a portable charger) Make sure to begin charging your phone at least a few hours before you leave. If you will be waiting in line for a while or waiting around between bands, you are going to want your phone to stave off boredom. Plug your phone in a few hours before you have to leave to make sure that it is fully charged. You may even want to invest in a portable phone charger if you anticipate a really long wait in line. Some portable phone chargers cost as little as $20 and most of them are slim enough to fit in your pocket., Since food and drink are often pricey at concerts, you can save money and make sure that you are well hydrated by drinking plenty of water on the day of the concert. You will probably sweat more than usual at the concert from dancing and moving around, so drinking plenty of water during the day will help protect you from getting dehydrated. , Make sure you leave yourselves plenty of time to get to the concert, park the car, and walk to the venue. Remember to account for traffic and road conditions as well. Plan to leave in time to arrive at least an hour before the concert begins, much earlier if you want to be the first ones in the door.

, Give yourself plenty of time to shower, get dressed, do your makeup, and style your hair. Give yourself even more time if you plan to paint your nails as well.

, Eat something healthy and hearty so that you don’t get hungry during the show. Whole grains, veggies, and lean proteins are all good choices. , Double check your purse or clutch before you leave the house to make sure you have remembered everything. Before you hit the road, triple check that you and all of your friends have remembered to bring your tickets!!

, Most concerts provide an option to purchase a VIP package, which often includes an opportunity to meet the band and get autographs. These packages are much more expensive than the basic ticket price and they usually sell out early, but they will give you an opportunity to go backstage and meet the band. This option is good if you don’t really like the idea of sneaking backstage and you can afford to buy the VIP package.

, The earlier that you show up to the concert venue, the better your chances of getting backstage will be. Lots of people try to get backstage at concerts and as the evening progresses, security guards become more cautious and selective of who they allow backstage. If you show up early, you will have a better chance., Since they are the ones blocking your entrance to the backstage, you will have a better chance of reaching your goal if you are nice to them. Don’t overdo it. Just be pleasant and polite. Make casual conversation with the security guards and try not to act like you are dying to get backstage, even if you really are! , If you notice a roadie lugging some equipment onto the stage and ask if you can help. If you are allowed to help, work really hard and thank the roadies for letting you help. This strategy may get you backstage and it can also land you an awesome on-stage vantage point during the concert.

, You are less likely to get backstage with a group of three or more friends, but if its just you or just you and a pal then security will be less likely to bother with you. , Trying to sneak backstage at a concert is risky because you can get kicked out of you are caught. If you do get caught sneaking backstage, don’t get angry or try to run away. Just be pleasant and apologetic if you get caught and you will have a better chance of not getting kicked out. , Although you may be freaking out inside, you will need to act casual if you manage to get backstage. If you seem way too excited, security will notice and they might kick you out. Instead, take a deep breath and enjoy your time backstage. , Stay calm if you bump into your idol while you are cruising around backstage. It's okay to act a little excited as long as you avoid gushing too much. If you have something that you were hoping to get signed, ask politely if he or she would mind signing it for you. If you want to pay your idol a compliment, go for it! Just remember to keep it simple and things are less likely to get awkward. Try something like: ""I've been a fan for years. Thank you for creating such awesome music!""Talking with your idol in the laid back manner is also less likely to catch the attention of security, which will increase your odds of getting to stay backstage.

, Depending on the size of the concert venue, there might be one large pit or multiple smaller ones. Look around and see where the closest one is and head towards it. You may have to wriggle your way through the crowd to get there.

, When you get to the edge of the pit, hand back for a minute and survey the action. There are several different ways to mosh. You can jump around, skank, run, push, or simply walk in a circle in the pit.If this is your first time in the pit, you may want to mimic what others are doing to start and develop your own moves as you get more comfortable. If the pit looks rougher than you expected and you change your mind about joining, there’s no shame in manning the sidelines!

, Once you feel ready to join the action, step into the pit and mosh around! Keep your arms out and moving around to protect yourself. Run, skip, or walk around the pit, bump into other moshers and push them around.

, Even though the mosh pit may seem like an anything goes sort of situation, it’s not.If you are too aggressive in the mosh pit, you may even get kicked out of the concert. To avoid having an unpleasant mosh pit experience, stick to these simple rules.


Help people who have fallen to get back up. If you notice someone on the ground, help them up and then keep moving. Don’t pull people into the pit from the sidelines. The people standing on the sidelines are there for a reason and they may get angry if you try to push or pull them into the pit. Don’t punch or kick people. The pit is not about seriously injuring people, it’s just a rough form of dancing. It’s okay to flail your arms around and kick your feet, but don’t direct your kicks and punches at people intentionally. Also, be careful not to whack anyone in the face while you are flailing your arms around. Don’t bring drinks into the pit. Take a break if you want to have a drink. If you bring your drink into the pit you will most likely end up dropping it or sloshing it all over yourself and other people. , Moshing is hard work. If you start to feel out of breath or overheated, retreat to the sidelines and take a break. When you feel ready to go again, jump right back in!

, Festivals are usually long, so it's best to schedule them over a weekend to ensure a large crowd. Also, paydays are on Fridays so more people will be able to afford a weekend festival.

,, Always be sure to get every detail, especially concerning money, performance dates and times. Get each performer's set length in writing through a contract to secure the deal. This contract protects both you and the artist.

, Do these things 6 to 8 weeks prior to your music event.


This is also when ticket distribution and sales begin, so finding outlets to promote your music festival is crucial at this time.

",How to Perform a Rock Concert," If not, it will fall apart during the first few songs.;
,, This part is not easy. A good bet is to simply hold a free concert right outside of your garage. This way you can play in the garage. Meaning you don't have to move any instruments, the people can listen from the driveway, and you don't have to charge anything.

, But you're still putting your name in their mind, so if they have a party chances are they'll let you play it.

, Their guests will see you and start spreading the word about your band.

,, If they need a band to open for them, they might just call upon you.

, It is an excellent way to get to know bands and even venues because most of them have one.

, Musicians always have a plan of what they're going to play, even if they act like they don't. A set usually consists of 4 or 5 songs. A concert usually has 3 sets. Encores are 2 songs, but don't expect an encore your first concert. The reason that concerts are split into sets is so the musicians can get a short rest and do something -besides play- to entertain the crowd.

, First tracks on any rock CD's are good. Then another heavy song, then a lighter one, then finish off the set with another heavy song.

, Same for the last set. Except for the last song. Play a really powerful song that will make them want to come back for more, like a ballad with really heavy distortion.

, The crowd will usually be easy-going. The best way to connect with them is through casually conversing and joking around with them. Who hates conversation, right? Don't go overboard until you know the crowd is on your side! Once you start playing shows where you know the people came to see you, feel free to go crazy, but otherwise, going too far will make you look like an idiot. Still move and jump around of course, but setting stuff on fire for example, can be too much depending on the circumstances.

Decide what you want to do.,
Round up the people you'll need.,
Choose music.,
Fill out the paperwork and turn it in.,
Practice.",How to Participate In a Solo and Ensemble Festival1," Fees, regulations, rating systems, and requirements vary from district to district, but for now, you're just deciding if you want to do a solo, ensemble, or both. Different districts might have different limits as to how many things you can do, but doing more than two in any situation probably isn't a good idea.;
,


If you're doing an ensemble, you'll need to find other people to be in it. Some places are stricter about ensembles than others, but many areas require that you have ""normal"" ensembles, such as a flute duet, woodwind quintet, brass quartet, etc., with the exact instrumentation used in a standard one of these. Unfortunately, that can cause roadblocks - for instance, if your band doesn't have a bassoon player, you can't do a woodwind quintet. Ask about what kinds of ensembles you can have, but even if you're free to do whatever you want, keep in mind that you don't want to be too weird. A baritone sax, an oboe, a piccolo, and a trumpet may be just a little too bizarre, and good luck finding music for a group like that.
If you plan on doing a solo, you'll probably need a piano accompanist (unless the piece you choose ends up not having a piano part). In most cases, you can sign up someone you know, like a parent, grandparent, church music director, etc., or if you don't know somebody who can play, you can ""borrow"" someone else from your school or the district.

, You'll want to make sure you choose something that isn't too hard to learn (but one that will challenge you slightly is good), and that you actually like. A good way to pick is to narrow it down by difficulty, for starters. Ask what grade music your band usually plays, and if you think you can handle it, ask to see some music a grade higher, or stay around the same grade. Then, it's just a matter of flipping through books, sightreading, and making a choice. If you're doing an ensemble, make sure all the members agree on it, even if you are the appointed ""leader"".

, On most registration forms, you simply have to provide the name of your piece, the composer and/or arranger, and your name/the names of people in your ensemble, as well as the name of your accompanist if you're doing a solo. Generally, the rule is one form per entry, which means if you're doing a solo and an ensemble, you need two separate forms, and if you're doing an ensemble, your ensemble only submits one piece of paper. Keep in mind that there also may be a fee, which can vary a lot in different areas. Be sure to read the rules on that very carefully and have your money in on time.

, This is the most important part, as it's the whole point of Solo and Ensemble - to practice a piece and strive for the highest rating possible. If you aren't offered an opportunity to practice at school, find a way to get together with your ensemble or your accompanist after school, as much as possible.

"
"
Put on your band uniform.,
Get your stuff together.,
When you get to the location (probably a school) where the event will take place (at least half an hour before your designated playing time), sign in to get your room information, and head to the cafeteria or other designated warm-up room to run through your music a few more times and wait for the rest of your ensemble or your accompanist to show up.,
Once everyone else you need has arrived and you've warmed up for a few minutes, find your room at least 15 minutes early and wait for your turn to play.",How to Participate In a Solo and Ensemble Festival2," This usually isn't required, but it should go without saying. The band uniform is an easy way for other people to see which school you're from, and it also makes you look more professional and prepared. Judges will sometimes give you the benefit of the doubt on little mistakes if you look good. If you're performing in an ensemble, make sure everyone knows to wear their uniform and which one to wear. An alternative to wearing your band uniform would be to color-coordinate your ensemble - be creative. You can all wear, say, a red shirt, dark blue jeans, and white shoes, or you can really be creative and try something more unusual, like having everyone dress as a different color of the rainbow and stand in the correct order.

, You'll want to have your instrument, a music stand (if you've been told to bring your own), extra reeds (to be put in your pocket in a reed case) or whatever else your instrument might need, the original copy of your piece (as in, the book or the piece of paper that came right out of it), if you have it, and your copy of the music. You may also want to have a backup or two of all the parts of your ensemble, including yours, or the piano part for your solo, in case someone else in your ensemble loses their music or your piano accompanist somehow doesn't get a copy of their part.

, Now would also be a good time to scout out your band director, if you don't already have the original copy of your music - if he didn't give it to you, he should have it.

, If you're nervous, just calm down... you're going to be fine.

"
"
Get used to the room.,
When the judge tells you to play, take a deep breath, and start playing your piece.,
Stay put.,
Take the original of your piece back from the judge and exit the room, when you're completely done.,
Pat yourself on the back... you've done a great job!

",How to Participate In a Solo and Ensemble Festival3," The judge will probably give you a minute to tune with your ensemble or with the piano, and it would be in your best interests to do so.

, Focus on the music, not the judge, who should remain still and quiet so as not to disturb you.

, After you finish playing, the judge may need time to finish writing on the scorecard, and then they often will tell you how you did, and may ask you to play certain parts of your piece over, with instructions on how to make it better. Don't take offense to this, and keep in mind that you may still get the highest rating, The judge is just trying to leave you with something to keep in mind for the future that will make you a better musician.

, Then, you can either wait around for your scores, which, depending on how many people are participating, could take from a few minutes to hours and hours to appear, or go home and get them from your director later.

Be prepared to pay annual membership fees. Some clubs limit the number of meet-and-greets you can have each year., Follow the band on social media. Get involved in chats or “follow-back” parties they host. Make sure you're chatting with a verified account. On Twitter and Facebook, verified accounts usually have white checkmarks in blue circles.You could say:

“I can't believe you wrote that guitar solo in just 15 minutes. That's amazing!”
“I was so psyched to find out you like rock climbing. I've been doing it for a few years now. If you're ever in my city, I can show you the gyms with the best climbing walls.”

, Do this if you're lucky enough to have a friend or relative in the music business. You'll probably have the most luck if you know a roadie or someone who works in a recording studio. However, it never hurts to ask your friend who writes for a music magazine or cousin who works as a DJ., Listen to your local radio stations when tickets go on sale. Be prepared to answer a trivia question or call in at exactly the right time. If you don't have time to surf the radio for hours, search online. Many stations will announce these contests on their websites., They cost extra, but you'll be guaranteed to briefly meet the band. Don't get your hopes up. You won't be able to hang out for too long. Most sessions only last long enough to get an autograph or quick snapshot., Many bands sign tee shirts, CDs, autograph books, etc. at music festivals like Coachella or Glastonbury. On the day of the signing, check the band's website or social media page for a specific time and location at the festival. Get there early, since most signings last for a short time.Bands also have signings at music stores when their new albums launch. If you have a music store in your community, keep an eye out when you know the new single is being released.

, If the concert doesn't have reserved seating, this is your chance to get as close to the stage as possible. If there is reserved seating, you might still be able to catch the band arriving for their soundcheck. Make sure you're standing at the back entrance reserved for the band. Do this with a few friends, since many back entrances are in dark alleyways., Find out ahead of time from crew members or other fans where the band will be exiting. You don't want to be behind the venue if the band will be exiting through a side door. Leave the concert a bit early to get a good spot. Just stick to legally designated areas to avoid getting arrested!, Older, more established bands sometimes play at local clubs, bars, and casinos. Of course, you must be old enough to legally drink alcohol and/or gamble to enter. If you're under legal drinking and/or gambling age, some bands might still play at state and county fairs. Smaller venues like these can improve your chances of meeting the band., Look up the band's information on their official website or in magazines (or their companion websites) like Rolling Stone or The NME. Read up on the band's history, backstories behind your favorite songs, and the band members' likes and dislikes. This will give you something to talk about.Choose your sources wisely. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone. Third-party blogs and fan sites aren't always reliable. You don't want to embarrass yourself by talking about a rumor as if it were true.

, Use it as an experience. Focus on the moods or emotions each song evokes. Listen for interesting changes in chords or keys. Pick out any catchy symbols or metaphors in the lyrics. Use these as something to talk about when you meet the band., Don't worry about memorizing a script. Just have a few handy talking points ready. Point out how one or two of their songs have made an impact on your life. If they influenced you to pursue a career in music, mention that. Avoid over-the-top statements like declarations of love or anything else that might make you seem like a crazed fan. You could say:“I really love the riffs in 'Stairway to Heaven.' That's what inspired me to start playing the guitar.”
“After I saw you profiled on 'Behind the Music,' I decided to pursue a career in music journalism.”

, Eat energizing foods like leafy greens, fruits, and whole grains to keep you going through the excitement. If you eat right before the concert, avoid garlic, onions, or other foods that can make you gassy or give you bad breath. To be on the safe side, pack some mints to chew before you meet the band., Unless you're a seasoned pro around famous musicians, you'll be nervous, which will make you sweaty. Pack a travel-size deodorant to apply right before you plan to meet the band. If you wear makeup, bring your facial powder to touch up shiny spots. Have a makeup sponge on hand to blot any eyeliner or mascara that might have smeared (unless, of course, that's the look you're going for)., Don't scream or coo. Talk to them the way you talk to your friends. If you get too excited, they might think you're just a crazed fan. Famous people are just as human as you are. Most of them prefer fans to treat them like everyday people., Don't interrupt them if they're eating or talking to someone. Ask permission before making any physical contact. An unexpected hug might freak them out. Finally, show other fans the same respect you'd expect by not hogging the band for yourself., This includes still pictures and video. The last thing you want is to embarrass your favorite musician by recording them in a touchy moment. If you give them a heads-up, they'll have a chance to straighten up before you snap a picture or record a video.Be respectful if they don't want to appear in a picture. Everyone has a bad hair or outfit day. If that's the case, opt for a short conversation. That memory might be greater than a picture.

, Compliment their performance if you're talking to them after the show. Give positive feedback about past performances you've seen for pre-show meet-and-greets. If possible, talk to them about their work or side projects, especially if they write or produce for another band., Ask questions about their approach to music, how they warm up, or what inspired them to start performing. Even if you're their biggest fan, there's always something new to learn. However, you should avoid asking personal questions, especially about their love lives or family lives. This will only make them uncomfortable."

Just because you're going with a group of ten people, this doesn't mean you can try to run in before security or the guys taking tickets and stamping your hands won't notice. They will. That's their job and if you're caught, you'll be out on the sidewalk while your friends stay inside and meet your favorite drummer.;
, This cannot be stressed enough. If you're at a venue which stamps your hand, you're covered, but otherwise, keep your ticket handy just in case you have to go outside and come back in. Otherwise, you're not getting back into the show.

, If something bad does happen (i.e., you get kicked in the face, defend yourself, and then the person who did the kicking acts like they're the victim), you'll have someone to defend you. Most of the time, the other people around you will help you out, but just in case, keep your friends close.

, This will only increase your chances of doing something to get kicked out. Alcohol dims common sense and your ability to judge things clearly. Therefore, you could end up doing something you wouldn't normally do without being intoxicated. And really, really don't do this if you're underage. There could be far more serious consequences than getting thrown out of a show.

, Though this can be tempting, just don't do it, especially if you don't know what you're doing. Security can and will drag you out if you're causing a pit to form when it's clearly prohibited. Plus, you could end up injuring fellow concert goers.

, If someone hits, slaps, kicks, steps on, or violently shoves you, leave them alone whenever possible. This can get you kicked out, depending on the thickness of the crowd and if a brawl ensues. But still, keep a cool head and walk away. If the person continues to bother you, tell security. Don't end up getting thrown out for something you didn't start.

, If you're underage, don't attempt to get a drink from the bar or get a friend to get one for you. Don't attempt to steal merch, vandalize the venue, or harass anyone, especially the bands. All of these can get you kicked out and definitely worse.

, Some venues, depending on who's playing, will not allow SLR (professional grade) cameras or video recorders into a show. Majority of the time, camera phones and regular digital cameras are allowed, but don't try to sneak anything else in. Either you could be thrown out or the item will be confiscated and there's a good chance you might not see it again, especially if you've already taken pictures.

, Just don't. It's insensible (otherwise there wouldn't be security to block you from getting back there) and the bands will probably get annoyed. There's a reason for an area for the general public and a specific area for the bands and crew. Though it could start out as the greatest moment of your life, it could end up horrible.

, This is pretty common sense. Don't bother, pester, back-talk, or provoke a security guard or anyone else who has authority at the venue.

, This corresponds with the rule above. If you're the sort of person who wants to cause a problem and has a fight to pick with anyone within talking distance, don't go to a show. You don't need to be there.

, If you have the courage to go back in, make sure you have the know-how to sneak around security without being seen by the same guys who took you out. Otherwise, you could be charged with trespassing or spend your night in the back of a police car. No show is worth that.

, Know the rules of the venue. Look them up online before you go or if there's a list of rules somewhere within the venue, read them, follow them. Most of the required behaviors are common sense, but if you feel the need, do so because sometimes, there are specific rules which aren't so obvious.

Go downtown and find a small pub or club that would be interested in holding an event like a Hip Hop open mic show.,
Do this first event for free.,
Decide on a name.,
Get an MC.,
Get a DJ.,
Choose a date.,
Design the promotional material.,
Make a flier.,
Promote well.,
Get the fliers out there.,
Post your recruitment fliers around town and see what happens.,
Sell the event.,
Check all is in place.,
Be early.,
Be sociable.,
Lead.,
Keep the spirit of the occasion flowing.,
Be confident.",How to Organize an Awesome Hip Hop Open Mic Show," Make sure the venue has a functioning PA system and at least 4 - 5 mics at the ready.;
, Eventually you may want to charge but for now just build your name up.

, With a venue on board, you must now think up a name for your event. It needs to be something cool and kind of iconic. My open mic shows are called Fight Night Open Mic. Everyone seems to like that. Make sure it's something that will roll off the tongue easily.

, The show will require a host to MC the show and keep it going along well. This person needs to have charm and charisma that the crowd and the artists will warm up to. If this person is you than the issue is resolved. If not, you will need to find someone you know that will be willing to be the host of your event.

, The next person you need to find is a DJ to play the music the artists will perform over. Since your artists will be bringing Cd's, this DJ is, in effect, just a person that will cue the songs up and play them for the artist. This can be done with a CD player connected into the PA system if necessary.

, Now that you have a name for the event as well as a venue, a host, and a method for playing your artists' music, schedule a date for your event with the venue that is at least two (2) months away. You will need every bit of this time to prepare you event.

, You will need to design two (2) different fliers; one to recruit performers for your event and the other to promote the event.

, The recruitment flier needs to be something that catches the eye but has room for a lot of important information at the same time. This flier needs to have the events name (written largely), an email address (yours or, preferably, one that you make especially for the event that contains the event's name in the title), a phone number (a number where you can be reached at all times), the address of the venue, the date of the show, and a basic description of the event you are hosting. Include on the flyer that they will need to sign up via phone or email and that there are only a select number of spots available. This will create a sense of urgency.

, The Promotion flier needs to do just that: promote. This flyer need to really catch the eye and pop off of the page using a wide range of colors and textures. Include the name of your event, the address of the venue, your phone number, and your email address.

, With these two (2) fliers designed, you can start promoting for the event. Take the first two weeks of your two month lead-time to prepare as many copies of your two (2) fliers as possible. You can save considerable time and money if you make just as many copies of your recruitment flier as places you can think to post them and devoting the rest of your money into making an insane amount of the promotion fliers. Make many full color promo fliers but remember to make a ton of quarter sheet black and white version of your promo flier just to pass out and leave everywhere you can.

, When people start to call, ask for their name, phone number and email address as well as how many songs they wish to perform. Try to limit the performances to about three or four songs. It also helps to get your friends out about town to search for talent that would wish to play your show. With any luck you should get a good amount of people who wish to perform. Focus the next two weeks to just recruiting your artists for the event.

, This should bring you to a month before the big show. This is when you start blanketing the area with your promotional fliers. Put them everywhere you possible can. Record stores, malls, musical instrument stores, clubs or anywhere music lovers are found are great places. Get all of your friends to hand out fliers where ever they go and make sure that they will show up to support you at the event. Do this for the next three weeks. Don't forget to keep signing up artists to perform during this time.

, With all of this done, you should now have one week left remaining until the show. Visit the venue and let them know you are still on board for the event. Try to strike a good relationship with the booking agent or club owner as this could be a valuable friendship down the road. Also be sure to keep promoting the event heavily.

, On the day of the show you should be at the venue at least two hours early to make sure everything is in order. Make sure your host (and DJ if you have one) arrives with you so you have plenty of time to discuss the game plan.

, Eventually your crowd and your artists will begin showing up. Introduce yourself to the artists and be sociable. As they arrive, take the CD with the music they wish to perform and write down the track numbers and order that they would like to perform them in. The order that the artists arrive will be the order they perform in. This will make the whole line up issue easier to resolve. First to come, first to play.

, About 10 minutes before the show, have your host grab a mic and call all of your artists to one corner of the club or outside so you can address them all at once. This is the time to be a leader. Tell them you appreciate their support and you wish them all luck. Get them excited to take the stage. Think of what a football coach says to their team before a game. This needs to be your attitude. Ask if anyone has questions before things get started. Once these things have been addressed, kick off the show.

, With any luck things should go well and everyone will have a great time. As the show closes be sure to thank everyone for coming out and let them know that there will be more of these events. Now that you have everyone's email addresses you can notify the artists directly about the next show.

, If you follow these steps and stay humble and confident, you should be able to make your fledgling open mic show grow into a staple in your city.

Applying special occasion makeup.,
Dress creatively.,
Use your accessories.",How to Look Good at a Concert1," A concert is a great time to break out your makeup and go for a look that is more dramatic than usual. It’s a special occasion and you will want your makeup to both accentuate and add intensity to your features. There are thousands of makeup tutorials available to view on YouTube if you are unsure of what to do or want to mimic a certain look. Simply search for “makeup tutorial” and thousands of results will be at your fingertips.


Apply makeup that will be impervious to sweat. When it comes to hot and sweaty concerts, the best choice for applying makeup is to ditch the liquid foundations and makeup and use powder. If you do use a liquid foundation, use a translucent powder over the top when you are finished applying it to set the makeup. This will prevent it from rubbing off when you start sweating.
Opt for a matte lipstick for a concert. You don’t want to sweat off your lipstick while you’re there. There are plenty of long-lasting matte formulas that will help keep your lipstick intact the entire night. Kat Von D’s line of liquid lipstick is a great example of a high-quality, long-lasting formula.;
, Attending a concert is the perfect excuse to dress to impress. Since music is all about creative expression, you should also feel free to express yourself through your wardrobe choices. When deciding what you should wear, remember to be true to yourself and wear whatever you want.


For a rock concert, you will want a look that is cool and doesn’t look like you are trying too hard. Dark colors will blend in well with the crowd. A leather jacket, some distressed jeans, and combat boots are the perfect way to achieve this!
For a pop concert, think bold yet cute. Wear a dress that is an eye-popping color, such as red, paired with some stylish black heels or flats, and a chunky necklace. Bright colors are great for flashy pop concerts.For a country concert, wear something that is classic country with a contemporary twist. Try a denim skirt or jeans, a top that has some sort of embellishment, such as a fringe or rhinestones, and a pair of snakeskin booties.
If you’re attending a hip hop concert, something laid back and athletic will do just the trick. Many hip hop artists and their followers are into sportswear, so tennis shoes and workout clothes are all the rage. Wear your favorite pair of sneakers with some fitted sweatpants, and a bomber jacket overtop a tank top or t-shirt. You could even wear your favorite pair of workout leggings., Play up your outfit by adding accessories. You can do this by adding a chunky necklace, a pair of earrings you adore, or a funky bracelet--or even all three! You will also want to pick out a good purse or bag for a concert. Use a crossbody purse so that you don’t have to worry about carrying your purse around and dropping or losing it along the way. A concert isn’t a time to be shy--get creative and show off your style.


Choose a hair accessory to accentuate your outfit, such as colorful clips, a headband, or barrettes. A hat may also be a good choice to show off your personal style and give your outfit some flair.

"
"
Wear layers.,
Choose comfortable, closed-toe shoes.,
Apply sweat-proof makeup.",How to Look Good at a Concert2," It is difficult to predict if the venue will be too warm or too cold, though you can usually bet on it being hot if it’s going to be a huge, crowded concert. To keep warm on your way to and from the concert during colder months, wear layers, such as a t-shirt with a bomber jacket over it. The bomber jacket is lightweight but will keep you warm if you need it. It can also be easily tied around your waist if you choose to ditch it in the middle of the concert.If you are attending a more subdued concert, it may be cooler inside the venue than you may expect. Wear either a lightweight jacket or a thick sweater over a shirt to ensure you stay warm during the concert, if you need to.
Attending a concert is a great excuse to break out one of your favorite band t-shirts.

, Lively concerts will often have everyone dancing and even moshing. Protect your feet and toes by wearing a pair of sturdy, yet stylish boots. If attending a rock or pop concert, try a pair of combat boots, which are stylish while still being heavy duty enough to protect your feet and keep them warm, if necessary. If you are attending a country concert, you can simply wear your favorite pair of cowboy boots. A concert in which everyone will be seated for the majority of the time will not necessarily require you to wear closed-toe shoes.

, You will want to incorporate powder into your makeup routine to stay looking fresh throughout the concert. Stay away from liquid and glossy products, as they will fade quickly as you sweat and could even smear. Finish off your look with a translucent setting powder to ensure that your makeup stays and does not rub off as you sweat. Keep the powder with you in your bag so that you can touch up as needed.


Opt for a powder foundation, such as Bare Minerals, to ward off shine throughout the concert.

Wearing a hat can also save you time styling your hair if you choose to use the hat as your main accessory. It can either accentuate or distract from your hair, depending on how you style it (or don’t).

, If you have long hair, hot weather makes wearing your hair down uncomfortable and sweaty. Remedy this problem by styling it into a bun or ponytail. If you have short hair, you can style it as you normally would or tie or pin it back to keep it away from your face. By tying or styling your hair up and away from your face, you will be able to keep your hair getting sweaty or getting messed up during the concert.

, For fall or winter outdoor concerts, you will want to dress in layers. You can pair a flannel shirt with a down vest or a bomber jacket with a long sleeve t-shirt. If you are opting for comfort as well as warmth, wear a sweatshirt with a pair of jeans and your favorite pair of sneakers.

, Summer concerts great time to break out your cute summer clothes. Opt for a pair of high-waisted shorts with one of your favorite band shirts. For a trendier look, wear a crop top with your shorts. You could also choose to wear a tank top to keep you cool yet stylish, or perhaps a cute sundress you’ve been excited to wear somewhere.


Wear light-colored fabrics, which will reflect the sun, thereby keeping you a bit cooler., Unless you will be sitting the entire time, it won’t be comfortable or practical to wear a pair of high heels to an outdoor concert. You may have to walk up or down a hill in the grass if you will be in the lawn seating of an amphitheater. Most people will be using this time to relax and let loose with friends; you should let your shoe choice reflect this. Choose a pair of comfortable sandals, flats, or boots (depending on the temperature outside) to keep your feet comfortable and ready to dance at a moment’s notice!

Pick bottoms that complement your shoes.,
Pull the outfit together with a fun top.,
Consider a dress instead.,
Add some accessories to your look.,
Do your hair and makeup.",How to Look Fabulous at a Concert1," While you usually start by finding a shirt to build off, for pop concerts try starting at your shoes and working your way up.


Heels (or wedges) are a great look. Only wear heels that you are comfortable enough in that you can stand for five hours straight without needing to sit down.
Comfortable flats are a better choice. Keep in mind you will be on your feet most of the time and might be dancing. Go for some colorful ballet flats or bright sneakers.
Boots are a more conservative choice but are still very fashionable. These are great because they are comfortable, fashionable, and look fabulous with a pair of jeans.
Avoid open toe flats or sandals. Venues are crowded and full of people moving and dancing. You are likely to get your toes stepped on and closed toed shoes will protect them!;
, For example, you want to build off the look you choose for your shoes.


Start by creating a chic-casual look with a pair of skinny jeans. These are comfortable for wearing to a concert.
If you wear boots try a pair of skinny jeans. This is going to create a fashion forward, sophisticated look. But be careful on this choice because it may be too tight and you will most likely be walking around a whole lot.
For an extra burst of color, try pairing your boots with a pair of bright or pale colored jeans.
You could also choose a pair of leggings in a complementary color and tone to your shoes. If your heels are more strappy or you want to dress up the look even more, try a fitted miniskirt or peplum skirt. Wear this in a color that complements your body and personality., You want to create a look that is feminine and sophisticated.


If you are wearing jeans, adding a white tee is always chic, especially when they are extra loose, have detailing or ruffles, or have an interesting cut.
If you are wearing a colorful fitted mini or a peplum skirt, a tucked in looser tank top is going to create a feminine look.
If you want to stand out, try wearing a sparkly shirt or something in a bright color.
Make sure your top is made of cotton. You will be dancing and moving around in a hot room and you will likely get very sweaty. Cotton is best for absorbing sweat. , Many popular looks encourage short simple dresses that you can accessorize.


If you decided that you want to wear a dress for a fun girls night out, try wearing a fitted dress or a cut-out heavy dress. Wear shorts under a dress because it could be windy,
Throw on a colorful pair of heels, or a pair of sultry boots to add depth to your dress.
Try wearing something a little bit more fitted than a Daytime or maxi dress. However, these kinds of dresses can be worn to a pop concert in the summer if it is going to be hot.
Popular stores for concert dresses and accessories include Top Shop and H&M.

, Wear some jewelry to complement the style of shirt, pants or skirt, and shoes you have chosen.


For earrings, chose a pair of earrings that make a statement. If you have multiple ear piercings, choose one statement earring and wear simple studs in the others.
A couple of leather bracelets are always a good choice. You can usually find leather or plastic bracelets engraved with the pop artists name or logo. Layered necklaces are all great accessories that don't overpower your outfit, but provide a nice fashionable twist.

, These looks should complement your outfit.


Usually a bold lip (red or coral) and/or a thick layer of liquid liner on the top of your eyelash line are enough to make your look fashionable.
Hair should always be done and look polished. That means blown out straight, worn in loose curls or a cut fishtail braid are all viable options.
Paint your nails or have them professionally done to really add sophistication to your look.

Get the right shoes.,
Build the look with accessories.,
Hair and make up can be worn to personal preference.",How to Look Fabulous at a Concert2," The unspoken rule of metal concerts is, however, not to wear the shirt for the band you are going to see. Find a band shirt for a similar band in the same genre as the one you are going to see.

Plaid miniskirts are especially popular at punk rock concerts.
If you are going to a heavy metal concert and plan to be in the mosh pit, wear jeans rather than a skirt. , Military boots, and dark sneakers are all rocker-chic.

Earrings should be minimal studs.

, Concerts are very crowded. There will always be smokers, druggies, crazies, and drunks. If you are by one of these people and are uncomfortable, talk to security and explain the situation. Most of the time they will understand and move you.

, The concert has ended and it's time to leave. This is a very dangerous time. Lots of people trying to go to one place is crazy. Make sure everyone has their cell phones or is with someone who has one. Make a plan. Tell whoever is picking you up a very specific place to get you. If anyone gets separated from the group, then they know where to go.

Take care of personal hygiene.,
Bring water.,
Bring sunblock.,
Be vigilant for mosh pits.,
Check the weather.,
Don't stand too close.,
Buy a shirt.,
Bring a backpack.,
If a band you hate is performing, don't scream at them to get off the stage, or that they need to die.",How to Have Fun at an All Day Outdoor Rock Concert," Remember that this is going to be outside with a bunch of hot sweaty and smelly people so before you go take a shower, you're probably going to want another one when you get home.;
, Almost all amphitheaters let you bring in at least one sealed bottle of water. Some people have entered with a gallon jug of water because it was sealed.

, If you burn easily bring sunscreen and don't wear black clothes or long sleeves, especially in the summer. People wearing long sleeves have been known to beg friends for cash to buy a shirt because it gets so hot.

, Mosh pits can get pretty dangerous and they form fast. Keep watching the area around you. A mosh pit is pretty scary if you've never been in one before or if you just don't like being in them. The area around them for a good 15–20 yards (13.7–18.3 m) can also be bad to stand in as you could get hit or trampled of people wanting to be in it. If one forms around you and you have to get out, get out fast and don't worry about your blanket, trying to get it will more than likely end up in you getting your head stepped on.

, If it rains enjoy it as it really cools you down.

, Try not to get too close to the front of the stage. Seeing as that's where most people go, it's way hotter there and that's where mosh pits like to form and you will get hurt it's also very crowded.

, Rather than blowing your money on that $10.00 cheeseburger, save it for a shirt. If you don't have enough for a shirt, you could possibly buy one in the parking lot for about $10.00. Some people had the experience of buying t-shirts for $4 each, instead of the usual $20.00 because they waited to buy them. But be aware that if you wait too long for that price to go down, you might not get the shirt that you wanted: as t-shirts sometimes sell out very quickly.

, Check online or phone to see if the venue allows backpacks. Concerts sometimes have free stuff and you don't want to carry it around all day. You also might bring a notepad and a disposable camera (outdoor venues usually let you bring one) to get pictures with bands you might be able to meet because wouldn't it suck to meet a great band with no paper for them to sign and no camera with which to get a photograph?

, It's rude to other people who may be enjoying the band - it makes them hate you. People can be very touchy about the musicians they like.

Think and be serious about this.,
Dress appropriately and comfortably.,
Be nice but don't be a kiss ass.,
Being a kiss ass is the no.1 most obvious and dangerous thing to do at a club or being out in general.,
If there is a short cut to the front of the bar line, TAKE IT!,
If you can't dance, then don't.,
Be weary, club environments are a stage for people to be whoever they want to be.,
Flashy stories, clothes and faces can deceive, remember the people at clubs probably aren't even really like what they seem once the night turns into day.

,
Finally, make the club your stage.",How to Go to a Club," What KIND of club are you actually going to? Clubs these days serve ( even if they don't say it outright ) for a type of person or scene. Of course, clubs are there to be enjoyed by anyone and everyone who want to go, but keep in mind what kind of environment and backdrop they are exhibiting. Is it a gentlemen's club, an emo club, a hipster club? These factors are important for your comfort and enjoyment.;
, Remember it's always good to stand out but you must feel comfortable and confident otherwise you stick out like a sore thumb. Going clubbing is a really good way to illustrate yourself to the people around you. If People don't like it, then f*** them, it's your night and it belongs to you. Dress codes are common at clubs these days. Flip flops, and jeans aren't always prohibited but may be frowned upon.

, Yes even to the bouncers who are one of the most important people to not cross the lines with.

, Remember, being easy going and acting interested will take you far. You're out and there are so many different types of people within a small radius, become immersed in these different arrays of people and listen to their stories *Note : Don't believe anything a drunk person tells you, and be aware of sleazy men trying to con you into sleeping with them

, Most likely the people behind you are too busy chatting away with someone they have met or whatnot. Going clubbing isn't cheap and it is wise to take a sizable amount of money that will accommodate your needs such as drinks, taxicab, entry etc. The bartenders are busy working people and if they don't get to you in a short time, be patient. If you piss them off, you'll end up sober for the entire night and it won't be good.

, I'm not going to put it lightly, bad dancing equates to embarrassment, hushed laughter and mockery from behind. However if you don't care about being humiliated and really feel the need to dance, then blatantly go for it. Sometimes something so bad can translate into something admirable and so good.

, This works for your advantage but also hinders it.

,, This is your chance to have a good night and be someone else. Forget your life and know that you are actually a popular and entertaining socialite inside. You have everything you need to make people drawn to you tonight, use it to your advantage!!

Pay attention to when tickets go on sale.",How to Get VIP Tickets," Most of the time you can find VIP packages on sale through ticket retail services such as Ticketmaster. You should also check websites that deal exclusively with VIP packages., Fan club members occasionally get access to tickets before they actually go on sale. These ""presales"" give you the chance to shop for tickets before anyone else. Be on the lookout for VIP packages if you get a presale notification.Joining a fan club may cost you some money, but it usually comes with a fair amount of perks. By joining a fan club, you may also have the option of entering contests to win prizes, including VIP packages.

, Radio stations often have ticket give away contests. While it isn't a guaranteed way to get VIP tickets, it rarely costs any money. You can win anything from concert tickets to film festival tickets depending on the station you listen to.Check different radio stations for different contests. Visit the website of each radio station and look for a contest schedule.

, Call the venue that is hosting the event you'd like to attend. Ask them if they offer any VIP packages. If the tickets are sold through a third party, the venue will likely be able to point you in the right direction.

, Some ticket retailers post valuable information on social media. Follow these websites to stay updated on the availability of VIP packages and ticket presales.You will usually be required to enter a special code to gain access to these sales. If you're not a part of the community, you won't be able to shop.Keep an eye out for contests run through social media. If you find out about a contest, make sure you read all the rules. Not only will the rules let you know how the contest works, you may find out ways to increase your chances of winning., VIP packages are a hot commodity and are likely to sell out fast. Familiarize yourself with various online ticket retailers to ensure you get the tickets you want.Make accounts with different websites to make the check-out process easier. Stay logged in while you're waiting for tickets to go on sale.Buying tickets online can sometimes be difficult. A lot of vendors give you a set amount of time to purchase tickets. If you run out of time, you have to start all over. It might be helpful to practice buying tickets to make sure you know how each website works. You don't have to buy anything, but you can still get familiar with the check-out process., VIP packages are not cheap, and some are well over $1000. You may need to start saving well in advance to make sure you can afford the VIP package when it goes on sale.Some events will cost quite a bit more than others. For example, if you want VIP tickets to a farewell tour, you're going to spend a lot more than if you were going to a standard show. Likewise, VIP tickets to a special sporting event, such as the Super Bowl, will be much harder to get than VIP tickets to a regular season game.
Plan ahead to make sure you know how much, and how long, you have to save.

, If you're serious about getting VIP tickets, you need to get them soon. The good seats are usually the ones that sell the fastest, sometimes within the first few minutes. If you know that tickets go on sale at 10 AM, make sure you're logged in and ready to buy a few minutes before."

Look in the local newspaper for up-coming shows.,
Make sure you get right up by the stage and participate when you go to their local performances: clap your hands, dance, disco, head bang, or play the air guitar.,
If they ask for volunteers, raise your hand, and try jumping a little, but don't bounce, or squeal ""pick me, pick me, oh oh, pick me!"",
If they let you come up on the stage to help them, look excited about it, and have energy with whatever they have you do.

,
After the show, make sure to go over and tell them that they were really good, and that you're interested in their music.,
Once you've talked to them for a while, it's very appropriate to ask for their Myspace/e-mail address.,
When you get home, visit their Myspace, but don't send your friend request for a couple days, even a week or two.,
Make sure to post friendly comments on their Myspace from time to time, or ask them where they're going to preform next.

,
Don't get hyperactive when you meet them.",How to Make Friends with the Local Bands," To meet bands, you need to go to their shows.;
, You just need to be active in the show.

, You just need to let them know you're excited, but not hyperactive.

,, If you have a band that plays similar music, this would be the time to tell them, and ask if they have any pointers (this is good if the show is not too crowded)

, Most bands have a Myspace, so if you have one, this is appropriate. If not, e-mail is okay, but don't give them yours. Just make sure they know who you are so when your e-mail arrives, it's not a surprise.

, You don't want to seem like a stalker, just interested and friendly. It would be appropriate to e-mail them in about 5 days or so.

,, That will only cause a bit a trouble.

If you're just too bored or can't get into it, follow the next step.



 

;
, Then you can take a short walk. However it is rude to walk out during a performance; you especially should not walk between the performance and the audience.

, Most phones have games, if not, explore its settings. You could even scroll through social media to see what people you know are doing e.g Facebook, Instagram. Keep the light down if it is dark in the audience. Keep the sound down or you will look like a jerk. It is better to refrain from looking at your phone for very long, though; try diverting your attention to the performance from time to time, especially if a friend/loved one is on stage.

, Look up at the ceiling and count the tiles or wooden planks. Do isometric exercises which are not obvious. You do not want to embarrass anyone., Look at the performance and analyze how the set was built, how the tech works, and how you would do it. You could also look at how the seats are set out., How would you escape (assuming you can run, jump and climb)? Imagine if a crazy gunman came in; how would you escape or defend yourself? How would you barricade and defend the room if you knew hordes of zombies were approaching?

, If you know you are going and you have a hoodie and an iPod, hide the iPod in your hoodie's pocket and run the cord through the inside of the hoodie, put the earphones on and jam. Some jackets have hoods with speakers in them, specifically made to play iPods. If anyone overhears this it will be very offensive.

, If you have a program, count the number of words in it, then read it backwards.

, This always works for me. Time will go by quickly. Just think about school, friends, what would happen if...., and such

Make an impression as soon as you step on stage.,
Check that you know your songs.,
Plan ahead.,
Be prepared!,
Develop your stage presence.,
Engage the audience.,
Look awesome.,
Enjoy yourself and have a good time!",How to Have a Good Concert," Don't run on stage as if you're at Glastonbury, just walk onstage and look like you're there to play through your songs and to have a good time as well. Don't creep onstage either. You need to let the audience let you know you're there.;
, Play through each song until you know what's happening each second. Learn each song so you can play it by heart while concentrating on what everyone else is playing.

, If you want to add a guitar solo to one of your songs, start working on it at least two months before showtime. The last thing you want is to mess up part of the song and watch in horror as the crowd boo you off stage and bring on another, more prepared band to completely outshine you.

, Make sure you have all the equipment ready and spare strings ready. You don't want to forget your guitar and struggle along using someone else's guitar that you feel uncomfortable playing.

, Don't stand at the back of the stage looking like you've just watched The Grudge. Have your guitar strap at a comfortable length and move about onstage. Also, if you're a drummer, try to get your body into it-the more movement, the more people will properly see you. Maybe even throw your sticks up in the air at the end of a song, just to show how much you're enjoying yourself.

, Don't start interviewing the front row, asking each one what they did that day and what they had for dinner, just talk to them. E.g. after the first couple of songs, just say ""how is everyone, you all doing well?"" if the audience scream and start clapping (or any other sign of having a good time), then you've got the crowd going and they will practically follow your every move. If not, just enjoy what you are playing and try to get the audience to enjoy it too.

, Wear clothes that suit the style of your music, and make sure that you are naturally looking good. Also, if you are a drummer and want to go onstage topless (due to getting hot), then make sure you have a decent body. I'm not saying you need a six-pack (although that can be good), but try to avoid going onstage topless if you are big and fat, as people might find it objectionable to watch your big fat belly throughout the entire gig.

, It doesn't matter if you can't get part of the crowd to enjoy it. Don't be discouraged by it. If some don't like your sound, it's probably because your style of music isn't their thing. Just relax and have fun!

Bring earplugs.",How to Get Great Seats for a Concert," You don’t want to purchase seats that you think are great and end up having a blocked view. See if the venue’s online seating chart mentions where obstructions of view occur. If it doesn’t, contact the venue.


Try asking, “Which seating areas have obstructed views? Could you tell me where I can find a map that marks which parts of the seating chart have unobstructed views of the stage?”;
, The internet is full of articles and reviews about the best places to sit at specific venues. Go to a search engine and type in the name of the venue. Then add the keywords “best seats” and search the web.


There are interactive seating charts online for many venues. Open a seating map through a website like SeatGeek or Ticketmaster. When you select a specific seating area, the chart will open an image of what it will look like from the vantage point of those seats.

, Box seats are generally better in the middle; if they’re off to the side you may only be able to see part of the stage. Box seats offer the advantage that there won’t be audience members ahead of you blocking your view. Typically there is more room in box seats as well. Well-placed box seats can be the best seats in the venue.Box seats may even be closer to restrooms and refreshments – consult with a map of the venue.

, If so, the balcony will be higher up and further from the stage. The balcony seats will probably be the cheapest choice, but won’t be great seats. You would probably need to bring binoculars or opera glasses. If the theater has just a single upper level, it’s usually called the “balcony.”The first couple of rows in the mezzanine are usually closer to the stage than orchestra seats. From the mezzanine you can see the entire stage.

, Venues that are designed like classic Greek theatres, for example, have upper balconies that protrude out over the last several rows of ground floor seats. This design actually muffles the sound those ground floor seats receive.It can also obstruct your view of the top of stage sets., If tickets are tough to get, you might have to opt for whatever seats you can snag. There can be advantages to upper level seats. You may not want to choose upper level seats if you have vertigo or a fear of heights that’s easily triggered.


You should be able to see the whole stage, although it will be a distance away. There may be a big screen where you can see up-close shots of the band.
You’ll likely be on an incline so that the people in front of you won’t block your view.
Sound floats upward well to balconies.Snag a side view. Tiered riser sections in front of the stage on the right or left can offer good views and sound. Being on an angle helps you to see when you’re sitting and other people are standing., If you’re short and get floor seats, you may not be able to see with people standing in front of you. Avoid orchestra seats in the center if you’re short. You could be blocked by large or tall people in front of you, and without an angled view you won’t be able to look around them.If you’re tall, floor seats and centralized orchestra seats should be fine for you. However, consider getting an aisle seat if you have long legs, as it might be difficult for people entering and leaving their seats to get past you.

, Floor seats are usually the most expensive seats, but are also considered some of the worst seats – it all depends on your personality. What is the vibe of the crowd that the performers attracts? Is it likely to be a laid back or highly energetic crowd?Would you expect a mosh pit to occur up front? For example, heavy metal, rock and rap concerts often have moshing, as well as some hip-hop concerts.
People in the floor seat area may crowd together, sweat, and even be pushy. They will often be holding up cell phones to capture footage. If you want an active, electric feeling and don’t mind the scene being intensely social, floor seats may work for you., If all you care about is being as close to the performers as possible, and price is no object, then front row seats may be your preferred choice. Keep in mind that if you have seats up front, you may not be able to see everything. The stage’s height is one factor: it can be high for shows at big stadiums. The stage may be obstructed by production equipment.If you’re sitting in the front row, you’ll probably be looking up most of the time and may get a sore neck. The second or third row is often better than the front row. If you want to choose the front row, consider sitting to the right or left instead of the center, as you will likely have a clearer view of the stage., If your top priority is sound, consider middle central seating. Surfaces towards the front, back and sides of the venue can break up the acoustics, especially by walls. Look for seats near the soundboard: engineers will mix sound for the entire location based on what they’re hearing.Sound waves mostly project in the direction they’re pointed, so if you find out where the speakers are, aim to be in their line of sight for the best sound.

, Check for presales, for example through the band’s fan club, or promotional offers on the artist’s website. Find out exactly when the tickets will be going on sale to public. That way if you can’t score presale tickets, you’ll be ready to try the public sale as soon as it opens.


Sign up for email lists of local radio stations, venues, and the band’s website so that you’ll be notified about any upcoming contests or special offers. You can also opt to get notifications from any of those sources’ official social media profiles.

, You have a better chance to get good seats if you buy less tickets, especially if you’re buying just one. You could always carpool with other concert attendees and then split up to your different seats at the venue. Make sure to have a plan for where to meet back up after the show.

, Don’t reload the page on the same device. If you get a “wait” icon that indicates your computer is connecting to the site, you should wait. If you reload the page, you can lose your place in the virtual line. You can, however, try connecting with a different device while you’re waiting for the browser to load.Avoid sharing a Wi-Fi network, which can slow you down.
Don’t try to use multiple browsers on the save device, or the website may think you’re a robot and block your IP address.

, If you can afford them, get VIP tickets. These are often the best seats in the house, and come with extra perks. For example, you might get an autograph, a meet-and-greet with the artist, or a fan club membership.

, Generally, seats become less expensive the farther they get from the stage. However, that’s not always the case. Sometimes seats are priced higher just so that they don’t appear to be bad seats to the buyer.If there are different prices for seats in the same section and row, go with the cheaper tickets., You may want to get more than one phone ready to call with. Practice hanging up and redialing with each phone. Landline phones will have a different way of disconnecting and redialing than cell phones do.

, If you’re willing to buy tickets for another, unrelated show, it can give you a leg up on the competition. Call a bit before ticket sale time, and select the option that lets you buy tickets through a human operator. When the sales representative answers, order tickets  for a show that is available already, since the tickets you really want will not be on sale for another few minutes.


Since you’ll already have the representative on the line, you can ask her for tickets to the other concert once the proper time is reached. This way you won’t have to spend time trying to get through on the phone when ticket sales begin, because you’ll already be connected to a live representative.
Say that you want the best tickets available for the second show.

, If you haven’t been able to get tickets by the day of the show, find out from the theater if there are any unclaimed house seats. These prime seats are reserved for creative teams, producers and artists, and if any are unclaimed the VIP seats may be sold to the public.This sale can happen as early as when the box office opens, up to as late as an hour before the curtain goes up.

, It’s important to arrive early because general admission tickets may not be a guarantee of seating. Also, they are first come, first serve, and you want to get the best seats you can! General admission tickets are seating or standing areas without assigned seats. There may be section, row, or seat numbers on the tickets, but if they say “General Admission” than the numbers are for inventory purposes and don’t represent your actual seats.The doors may open an hour or even several hours before the show begins. Plan to get there as early as possible and wait outside for the venue to open if necessary.

, “Seat poaching” happens in places like concerts and airplanes, and is discouraged by the respective authorities. It isn’t fair to other people who are staying in their assigned seats. Furthermore, you can be tracked down by ushers and get in trouble with the venue.


Empty seats may be meant for accessibility for disabled people, or reserved for employees who will come and go., Sometimes tours, fan clubs or venues will have seat upgrade contests, which you can search for online. In some instances, tour staff may approach people who are already seated far away from the stage and give upgrades to loyal fans who can answer band trivia. You can also install an app, such as Pogoseat, that gives you the ability to request concert seat upgrades.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but earplugs can actually help you to hear better at a concert. They take the edge off the sound so that you can enjoy it. They also reduce your chances of ringing in the ears and hearing loss."
"
Cold call.,
Work at the venue.,
Say ""I'm on the list."",
Go as press.",How to Get Backstage Passes to Any Concert," Most freelancers start out the same way. They cold call a media outlet to inform them of their status as a freelance photographer or writer. Next, the freelancer will pitch an offer to go to the event and interview and photograph the band, crew or venue manger. Many media outlets frequently make use of freelancers to achieve wider coverage. They’ll be used to these calls, so when you call, sound like you’ve done it before. Most people will use the Ultimate Backstage Book which is the industry standard.;
, There is always a need for volunteers to direct backstage traffic, to provide security or janitorial services at big events. Stage production companies need people to lug cases of instruments and sound or lighting equipment on and off the trucks. You may even be able to hand out promotional flyers. Staging a large event is a coordinated effort that requires a lot of manpower. They always welcome an extra hand -- especially if it’s free. You may want to contact them a few weeks in advance to volunteer your time and get a free concert in the process.

, If you are inconspicuous enough, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the guest list. Once you have been able to do so, pick a name of a person that you could pass as. Try to select a corporate sponsor if possible, as many don’t attend and they often receive passes as a courtesy. This is a little sketchy and can get you in trouble.

, This is probably the most effective way to get backstage passes. When artists have concerts, usually in the contract, the concert promoter is required to give comped passes to the artist. The artist uses the comped passes for friends, family, and press. In order to get on this list and get comped passes, you will need to contact the manager or publicist of the artist in advance of the concert. Sometimes you can find the contact info for their manager or publicist sometimes through their Facebook page. Once you get the artist's or manager's contact information, then you will need to send an email with information about the publication that you are representing, and what exactly that you are looking to do.

Decide on where you want to be in the crowd when purchasing tickets.,
Depending on the band's popularity in your area, you may have to queue since as early as morning of the day, or even the day before.,

, If you're planning to queue, don't tire yourself out before the actual show begins.

, If cameras are not allowed, don't take them unless you know you'll be able to avoid security. Most venues say they don't allow cameras and video recorders, but it's usually only a restriction against professional grade cameras.

"
"
Be firm but fair.,
Get up the front well before the opening song.",How to Have Good Concert Manners2," No doubt you will not be the only one wanting to get up close and personal with your favorite musicians. If your aim is to get to the front row in the mosh pit, there is no need to jump the queue, push people out of the way or resort to petty violence (kicking, pinching, pulling of hair and in extreme cases: biting). These acts of desperation just rub everyone the wrong way. You could also be asked to leave the venue completely.

, It is a hassle to everyone if you push and shove your way from the back of the crowd to the front just as the band starts playing. People who have been there for hours on end will not appreciate you pushing past them for a better spot. A good concert spot is earned.

"
"
Wait for an intermission before making phone calls.,
Use your cellphone/camera sparingly.",How to Have Good Concert Manners3," Texting during a show is fine, just don't make calls and make an issue for other people.

, Taking pictures with your cellphone is distracting; not to mention it blocks the view for the people behind you. Those who spend the entire show recording the gig on their cameras or phone are not living in the moment. Though you might want to capture an amazing shot, you'll most likely miss out on something better by being distracted with your camera or phone.

Avoid song requests.,

It is rude to talk about anything other then the concert.,
Be supportive of other support acts.,
Assess the crowd.",How to Have Good Concert Manners4," Only request a song when the band has asked the audience to do so. Many times, they will not as they already have a setlist that they try to follow. Don't be 'that guy/girl' and ruin the show for everyone else.

, Everyone is there to enjoy themselves, just like you are. If in the mosh pit and the people around you start jumping up and down, go with it. If you stand still you are likely to get knocked around and annoy those dancing by you. If seated, stand only if everyone else is standing. There is nothing worse then having your view blocked by the person in front of you.

, In mosh pit situations you will make contact with other people's limbs, drinks and handbags. Take it with a grain of salt. If you get whacked on the head by a flailing arm, ignore it. Same goes for those in the seats, accept that the leg room is minimal and that knees will press from time to time into your back. It is nothing personal. Same also goes for General Admission.

, If someone mistakes you for the guy who shoved them roughly out of the way and punches you in the stomach, ignore it. There is nothing to gain by retaliating unless you are sure that you will not be the one to come off worse. But if someone continues to harass you, go to a security guard and leave the area.

, Even if you are an amazing singer, no one paid to come and hear you.

, Save the talking about your day between sets or until after the concert. Don't have long, loud conversations about things that are completely irrelevant to the show.

, You may not like them or feel they compliment the sound of your idols, but they're there for a reason, too.

, If they aren't crowd surfing you shouldn't be either.

Do a few test runs to see how you can call the radio station’s number the fastest. Test your phone to see if it’s faster to manually input the phone number or call it from a saved contact. If you have more than one phone available to you, test which one dials and redials the fastest.
Try calling in on multiple phones at once, and listen to multiple radio stations for more giveaways., Look out for contests or giveaways on social media sites of radio stations, music venues, or bands themselves.

Use your contacts.,
Take advantage of presale events.,
Check Craigslist.,
Check a ticket broker on the day of the show.,
Try a seller at the music venue.",How to Get Concert Tickets Cheap or Free3," Get to know people in the music industry, whether they work at a venue, in marketing and advertising, or in band promotion. Hint that you’d love to get to see a show sometime, or outright ask if they have access to freebies and are willing to sell them or give them away.


Get well known among your friends and co-workers as the person who will take extra tickets off their hands at the last minute. If you send them a thank-you note or email afterwards and say how much you enjoyed the concert, they will likely think of you the next time they have spare tickets.

, Check far in advance of a show for when tickets go on presale and may have a reduced price. Join a band’s fan club or mailing list to hear right away when tickets are on sale. Check music festival sites for very discounted “early bird” tickets. Look into credit card companies that offer discounts and advance tickets to cardholders before they go on sale to the public.

, Get on Craigslist or another site where individuals can post items for sale. Look a day or two in advance of the show or on the day-of to find sellers who can’t make it and try to sell their tickets at the last minute. Avoid scams by always meeting with a local seller in person and never giving out any of your bank information., Check out ticket resellers or brokers to see what they’re offering tickets day-of. Many times the broker will be willing to sell at a loss to recoup some of their investment if the show didn't sell out.


Always find a broker that accepts credit card payment, and choose this option to pay for tickets. If the tickets turn out to be fake, you have proof of your payment to get reimbursed. Also make sure they have an 800 number to be reached by., Head to the venue about an hour before the concert starts, and look for anyone openly calling out, holding a sign, or obviously holding tickets to their chest to advertise that they have extra tickets. Feel free to haggle a little with them to get a cheaper price. Sometimes a desperate or just kind concert-goer will simply give an extra ticket away right before the show.


Before you arrive at the venue, put the amount of cash you’d like to pay for a ticket into your pocket, with a little extra cash in another pocket in case you need to sweeten the deal. Make sure you have small bills so you can make exact change.
When a seller tells you their price, tell them you’re on a budget. You can even say, ""Oh, I can only pay (x-amount); you should sell your tickets to somebody who can pay what they're worth."" They might end up offering the tickets to you for your price, or you can use your extra money for an offer that’s close.
If you’re not finding tickets at your budget right away, sellers are apt to come back to you when the lights flash and they realize the show's going to start without them. This time they might accept your budgeted price.

If you’re not sure of their trustworthiness, look the company up through the Better Business Bureau’s website. You can also confirm that they belong to the National Association of Ticket Brokers, which means they agreed to practice basic consumer protection.Some examples of well-known ticket sellers are StubHub, Ticketmaster, and Live Nation.
If you’re buying online, get on the website at least 15 minutes ahead of the online sale and make sure you are logged into your account.Have multiple devices ready, in case the website is overloaded with many other users vying for the tickets.For example, try using a computer with a wireless router and a mobile device that uses its own network. Don’t use multiple devices through the same internet network, because your requests will be coming from the same IP address and you may get blocked by the website. Similarly, don’t use different web browsers on the same device., Go to the venue’s box office when ticket sales open. If there is a reasonable number of people standing in line, physical box offices will often count how many people are there and subtract that number from the public sale., Ticket distributors and venues often host contests that offer the public a chance to win tickets.

A concert ticket search engine – for example, SeatGeek – allows you to search through multiple ticket sellers at once.

, Auction sites like eBay can have a great deal of tickets offered for sale. Ticket prices will generally be higher than face value, because the holder of tickets may sell at any price they wish. Also, the show is sold out, so most if not all of the tickets will be sold in auction format, where the price is determined by the highest bidder.


Reviewing the seller’s feedback first is a good way to gauge their trustworthiness. You should also familiarize yourself with the auction site’s terms and conditions about refunds, in case you don’t receive the ticket on time or it does not grant you access as it should., Search online classifieds in your local area, such as Craigslist. You can also look in the “For Sale” section of classifieds in your local newspaper. Individual or season ticket holders may be offering their tickets for sale.

Season ticket holders do sell seats back at the last minute., If all else fails and you aren’t able to get tickets to an event in your area, check the artist’s tour schedule for stops in other cities. There may be a nearby city on the agenda next that isn’t sold out. Alternately, you may want to make travel arrangements to see the performer in an even further locale if it is easier to acquire tickets for it and you don’t mind getting away for a couple of days.

, People who resell tickets on the street outside venues are referred to as ticket “scalpers.” As a last resort, you could try to buy tickets that way, if it’s allowed in your area. Check with the laws of your state first. Some states allow this practice, but in other states it is illegal.Even if buying tickets from a scalper is legal in your area, it is still a risky practice. Counterfeit tickets can appear very real, and there is no definite way of verifying them until you present them at the gate of the venue.

,, If you stand at the front all day you'll miss the interaction further back. If you never get up close you'll miss the adrenaline. It's a good idea to just go with the flow, see where the day takes you. It saves you getting upset at missing the perfect view, or at having to leave your spot for the toilet or some food. Some of the best festival experiences are to be had further back in the crowd, singing and dancing with total strangers.

, They enable you to sit on the ground when it's wet and can be used to protect your bag from rain. Don't bring chairs or stools as they block people's view and create an obstruction, which is rude. Don't feel you have a right to any particular space - festivals are a free-for-all and you need to be laid back otherwise you'll find the whole experience very stressful.

, This will keep it well refrigerated and you don't have to sample any of the fast food stuff! But if greasy spoons (which are quite nice as an occasional treat) are your thing then go for it; just be prepared for horridly long lines and the possibility that someone will snaffle your great spot while you're gone. (Have a friend guard it if you go with someone; take it in turns to seek food, bathroom breaks etc.)

, Long ponchos are a good idea because they keep your bag dry too. Don't take an umbrella though because they are dangerous in a crowd as people jostle about and it's easy to accidentally poke somebody. Just expect to get a little wet. Water won't kill you. You should also make sure to take sunscreen because it's occasionally sunny, and a warm jumper in case you get cold.

Prepare yourself mentally and physically for the concert.,
Most importantly ENJOY YOURSELF.",How to Enjoy a Rock Concert," Is it metal? which involves intense guitars, drums and loud vocals? Mainstream, radio friendly rock? or even classic rock? Your behavior depends on what kind of concert it is.;
, Now, I know what you're thinking. What if I don't know the words to every song? It's perfectly alright to not know every word. But try to know the majority. To do this, do some research on the band playing months ahead. Look up the lyrics. Buy the CD and listen to it a lot. Then when you go to the concert, you'll be able to scream/sing along with everyone else.

, Wear old clothing. Old jeans and shirt. Band tees are good, too, but don't wear a tee for a band the total opposite of the one playing. For example, do not wear a Jonas Brothers tee shirt to a Bullet for my Valentine concert and vice versa. Do not wear anything that you don't want to get dirty. Bad idea. So, new, expensive and valuable clothes are out.You may get dirty at concerts.

, A mosh pit is a section, usually near the front of the stage, where people can vent their adrenaline to the music, which usually involves colliding with other people. It may get violent at times, and it's best you stay out in order to prevent serious injuries. Also, mosh pits don't happen at every concert. For example, there wouldn't be a mosh pit at a Jonas Brothers' concert (except maybe a pushy little girl or two). There will be moshing at heavy metal bands and especially at death metal band concerts.

, Don't go alone. You need to be able to laugh and sing and dance with people you know and love. The more people you bring, the better. Then you can surround yourself with people that you know and you'll worry less about being with a crowd. Make sure you know where your group is and try to stay with and close to them all times.

, About an hour or two before the concert, prepare. Take a hot shower. Watch TV. Relax. Read a book. Do not listen to any music or anything too loud. Just sit and relax. Get a back massage from a friend or family member. I also suggest taking a nap; that will refresh you.

Pick various parts of the orchestra to see if you can hear their particular sound qualities and to identify them. Marvel at how so many different sounding instruments can come together and sound so harmonious.

Go to the toilet locally 30 minutes before the doors open, and have a friend hold your spot, then swap. This will also save time.

, Plenty of people make up the front row, plus those in front of you will be eating their time by not following the above tip.

, O2 often have a priority queue in some places. Find out what you need to avoid being held back whilst others get in.

, Unfortunately some venues have gendered queues, meaning queues are divided to get the same gender security to search you. If you and the person/people you're going in with are mixed genders, consider meeting at the barrier rather than waiting for each other. (Apologies for this binary explanation).

Stand somewhere in the middle/back and watch the support acts.,
The second your artist comes on, go ballistic.,
Use Natural movement.",How to Get to the Front of a Crowd at a Concert2," Enjoy them, perhaps have a drink, etc. Wait for your favourite act to come on. Don't try to get to the front now, or you never will.

, Run as fast as you can, jumping about to get to the front. Give all your energy, jump, sing, and dance. Give 10 times the energy of everyone around you. There's a psychological trick going on here. When you make people believe that you want to be there more than they do, they will just let you pass them. If you're getting in late and they're already performing, just follow this tip as soon as you get in, but it may not be as effective.

, After following the above tip, you should be as far as you can get (which should be just a few rows from the front). This is a hard place to be. Embrace the pushing and shoving, the natural movement of the crowd, and use it to your advantage. Slip through the cracks to get closer. Know your limits though, accept water from the bouncers when it comes. If you're lucky, you'll find your way to the very front.

Prepare.,
Dress casually.,
Don't layer.,
Do not wear your best clothes.,
Solid shoes are essential.,
Lay off the accessories.,
Keep the makeup simple.,
Tie back the long locks.",How to Dress and Look Like You Belong at a Rock Concert (for Girls)," It might seem like a good thing to wait until the last minute to dress and leave for a concert, but try to avoid this common mistake. The night before, or even before that, pick out what you'd like to wear, compare to other things in your wardrobe, then decide on a final outfit. You'll want to be in something that's comfortable yet stylish according to who you're seeing.;
, You can never go wrong with a plain black t-shirt and some form of jeans or shorts. Avoid wearing a shirt from the band you're seeing (this can make you seem a tad obsessed or like a newbie). Instead, if you'd like, get some friends together to make unique shirts for the headlining band. The band will appreciate your efforts and you'll look like you really put some thought into the night.

, No matter what the weather is (this depends on if you're at an inside venue) it will get hot when you're smashed up against hundreds of jumping fans. During the winter, it might be slightly better, but an inside summer show can and will get unbearably hot if you're in the middle of the crowd. Try to wear light fabrics (without them being sheer enough to see through) and avoid thick denims for jeans.

, They can get dirty, smoky, sweaty, and possibly ripped if it's a harder show. Look nice and stylish, but don't wear that new pair of $200 jeans you bought the same morning.

, The number one rule of concerts is to never, ever, ever wear any other shoes than sneakers or boots. Flip-flops, sandals, heels, backless shoes = big mistake. Not only can they come off or give you blisters, but people will purposely (the 'veterans' of concert goers) step on your shoe just to see it fall off.

, Some people tend to over-do it when it comes to jewelry and such at concerts, but try to avoid this mistake. Large rings can cause injuries to you and others around you when you're all jumping around. Long necklaces will get tangled and hit someone or even get broken. Dangling earrings are a very bad idea (the last thing you'll want is a ripped earlobe by the end of the night). Just keep it simple. Braided, fabric, and those rubber bracelets from bands are good alternatives to your usual garb. They won't injure anyone and will most likely stay on much better than anything else.

, (unless it's a rock concert because they are all about the heavy eye makeup ) Since you'll be there for at least four or five hours, depending on who you're seeing and the venue, you'll want to keep the makeup to a minimum unless you're just willing to risk smears. There won't be a lot of chances for touch-ups unless you want to chance losing your place in the crowd. It will also sweat off eventually, so if you are wearing any, waterproof is best.

, If you have long hair (below the shoulders) you'll want to either already have your hair up securely somehow or have a hair tie with you. During the first half of the show, it shouldn't be too hot or crazy so you should be alright, but later on, you'll want to be able to keep your hair out of your face.

Select a top.,
Find bottoms to complete the ensemble.,
Pick a jacket.,
Choose the right footwear.,
Style your hair.,
Do your makeup.,
Pick a bag.,
Try some bold jewelry.,
Opt for the right style of accessory.",How to Dress for a Rock Concert," Before choosing what to wear to a concert, you should figure out what type of concert you'll be attending, such as whether it’s inside or outside, if it’s a large or small venue, and what time of year the concert will be taking place.The type and location of the concert can help you dress appropriately, and will guide you when selecting your outfit.


Even for indoor concerts, the time of year still matters because you’ll have to comfortably get to and from the venue. If it’s the middle of winter and below zero outside, you may have to reconsider wearing sandals and shorts. Similarly, if it’s summertime, you may not want to wear a full leather outfit, even if the concert will be in an air-conditioned building.
Indoor concerts at a small venue will get hot very quickly, while concerts at large arenas may stay cooler.
Outdoor concerts usually only happen in warmer weather, so make sure you go prepared with hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and plenty of water.;
, Wearing a layered outfit is always a good idea when there are possible weather and temperature variables involved, because layers mean you can take clothes off if you get too warm, and can put them back on if you get cold.


To dress for a rock concert, think about your layered clothes in terms of a cohesive outfit. When choosing colors, opt for a mostly dark outfit with a few accents in a bold color. For instance, you can wear black pants and red shoes with a black sweater layered over a bright red tank top or T-shirt.

, There are a few different styles of tops or shirts you can wear to a rock concert, but one of the main things to keep in mind is comfort. Especially if you'll be dancing or moshing, you want to choose breathable clothes that are easy to move around in.


A classic shirt for a rock, punk, or grunge concert is a dark T-shirt or tank top.
For a slightly more fashionable look, consider a fitted V-neck tee in black or dark gray.To achieve a more goth or glam rock look, consider a corset, or a fishnet top for men or women.
If you're going to wear a band T-shirt to the concert, wear a shirt for a band other than the one you're going to see.You may want to avoid a dress, skirt, or kilt if you plan to stage dive or crowd surf,or consider wearing shorts underneath.

, Weather can be a big factor when choosing bottoms for a concert, but jeans or basic black pants are always a popular choice. Other options include:


Shorts
Cut-off shorts, a skirt, a dress, or a long sweater paired with leggings
Black, gray, or dark blue jeans or skinny jeans
Leather or pleather leggings (best reserved for the cooler months), A top layer over your shirt is a great way to layer your clothes for a concert, and gives you the opportunity to add more style to your look. If you get too warm, you can always check your top layer. Good top layers include a:


Cropped and fitted pleather or leather jacketThin and unlined blazer
Knit sweater
Hoodie

, Footwear is key at a concert, especially if you're going to be standing for the duration of the event, dancing, or moshing. Ideally, you want sturdy shoes that are comfortable to wear for long periods of time.Boots, such as Dr. Martens or combat boots, are a good choiceRunning shoes, sneakers, or skater shoes can be comfortable and stylish when paired with the right outfit
Avoid dress shoes, which may be uncomfortable after hours of standing
Avoid flip flops, which don’t provide any support for your feet, and instead opt for sandals if you want to wear warm-weather shoesAvoid high heels, but if you must wear them, opt for shoes with a chunky heel., There are many ways you can style your hair that will be appropriate at a rock concert, and you can be a little more creative than you might otherwise feel comfortable doing.


Sticking with your natural hair is always a safe bet, especially if you're going to be getting hot and sweaty. For instance, don’t try to straighten curly hair or curl straight hair, as the heat and humidity at the concert may ruin your style.For a more hard core or punk look, try teasing out short hair or spiking it up.If you’re a dancer or mosher with long hair, consider tying your hair into a ponytail, bun, or braid to keep it out of your face.

, There's no rule saying you have to wear makeup to a rock concert, but if you choose to, you have several options. Keep the makeup to a minimum, though, especially if you plan on dancing, or you may just sweat it all off!Thick mascara and smudged black eyeliner is always a safe choice for a rock look.For the lips, try a pale or pinkish lipstick or gloss.
If you're feeling bold, go for a lipstick or nail polish in black or bright red.Guys at rock concerts will sometimes sport black lipstick and thick, smudged eyeliner in black or dark gray.

, Clothes with deep or zippered pockets are great, and mean you can get away with not taking a purse or bag. But if your clothes don’t have such pockets, you may need a bag to store important stuff, like your keys, phone, and wallet.


Opt for a small and sturdy bag that goes over the shoulder or across the body, like a messenger bag. This will ensure it stays out of your way if you're dancing, and makes it harder for someone to steal., Thick, metal, and chunky jewelry is optimal for rock concert chic. For durability and the aesthetic, avoid delicate or fine jewelry, and for safety reasons, stay away from anything too long or dangly.A metal bracelet or bangles can be a nice touch on a concert outfit, but chunky wrist cuffs work just as well for guys and girls.
A short necklace with a bold design or pendant is also a great choice, or a thick metal chain with a symbol or emblem hanging from it for guys.

, When it comes to dressing for a rock concert, you can't go wrong with clothes and accessories that are pleather/leather, metal, studded, or decorated with skulls.This includes:


Thick, bold belts with lots of metalStudded leather jackets, boots, and bags
Scarves and shirts with skulls

"
Consider the weather and dress accordingly, but do take into account the fact that all of the bodies crowded together will create heat.,
Wear dark colors so as not to draw attention to yourself.

,
Wear a T-shirt featuring a respected metal band.,
Pair your tee with a non-baggy black or blue or baggy black jeans and possibly a studded belt, but take care that it doesn't look trendy or cheap.

,
An option is to wear metal band wristbands and fingerless gloves.

,
Wear leather: Leather has always been very heavy metal, and also very warm.,
Denim Jeans: Jeans are a metal classic.,

, Wear blue or black jeans.

, More importantly these items can get easily caught in things and grabbed by people.
95% of the times spikes and similar objects are forbidden, so avoid problems and refrain from wearing potentially harmful accessories.

, You'll want sturdy footwear for a concert, especially a crowded metal concert, to protect your feet from crowds.


Boots are good.
Sneakers are OK. Black Converse shoes are good because they can be done up very tightly
Sandals or flip-flops are a big no.
Make sure that your shoes are tied tight, due to the fact that its pretty easy to lose a shoe or two inside a mosh pit.
Van's high tops are still worn by the old school metalheads.

If you don't feel like dancing too much, crowd surf.",How to Dance at a Rock Concert or Mosh Pit," If you plan on headbanging stretch your neck a little so it's not so hard on your neck to start with. Do some neck rolling and arm, knee, and leg stretching. If you're at a mosh pit, keep to the sidelines to warm up. Remember to keep your fist outstretched. At a concerts it may be a little harder, but if you have the chance, stretch your limbs discreetly.;
, If you're at a pit, give the water to a trustworthy friend in the sidelines. Remember to never get dehydrated. This can lead to headaches, lack of concentration (so disregarding other people in the pit), and especially if your dancing and getting hot, fainting.


At a concert don't be surprised when you have to pay quite a bit of money for some water. If you really need water, some concerts have security guards that will give you something to drink. Also, energy drink might be a good idea to start off with, but don't just drink them for the sake of drinking it.

, Wear clothes that fit well, but are slightly loose because you will get hot in the pit. Shoes can also come loose so wear tightly laced sneakers or boots. Nothing with spikes, studs, points, sharp edges, and no dangling earrings, because you can injure yourself and others. Simple studs or no studs. Face and body piercings look cool, but will be a liability in the pit. You would hate for half your eyebrow to be ripped off because some particularly violent monster wasn't paying attention, right? Right. It would totally mess your day up.

, Do not leave any valuables like money, cell phones, jewelry etc in your pockets because they will probably, or (depending on how violent the pit or concert is), definitely fall out and will be near impossible to find again. Leave them at home, or with a friend on the sidelines.

, There are some basic rules of etiquette that you'll need to know, some of them you can apply to a rock concert, too. The following three steps are the basics.


Copping a feel - don't do it, this is horrible, especially for the girl you're doing it to. Girls can get totally freaked out by it and will usually call out whoever did it. If you were guilty, you will be outnumbered and in for an unpleasant experience. If you see someone else do it to a girl, call out what happened and who did it and that guy will get singled out and targeted. You may get some thanks in return.
Hitting - you're not at the concert to start a fight. If you see someone trying to stir things up, either leave if you feel uncomfortable and stand on the sidelines, or move out if the way if at a concert. If you do accidentally hit someone, mouthing a SORRY! over the music or shaking the person's hand is very much appreciated.

, If they're on the floor, or have just been hit, help them up. They will probably smile and thank you. If they are seriously hurt (you may have to scream at them over the music to make sure), a simple ""can you get up?"" or ""are you badly hurt?"" is easy to reply to with either a shake or nod of the head. If they can get up and they just have a nosebleed or something, take them to the nearest medical place. Security guards may have a first aid kit on them. If they can't get up, ask some other people to help and go get some help from security ASAP. If you are hurt, ask someone to help you or go to security and ask to sit somewhere.

, Depending on what kind of rock music it is, you'll need to vary your dancing style. Let's say it's something like Fall Out Boy. Easy to dance to, since a lot their songs have a very good beat.

, Do this to that if you are knocked, you won't fall over so easy. Find the beat, and nod your head with it. Let's say the song F.O.B are playing is This Ain't A Scene (It's An Arms Race). Obviously if no one else is dancing, dancing crazily is probably not going to be a good way of upgrading your ""social agenda"" if you know what I'm saying? If the crowd are jumping around, putting up the ""horns"", or just got their arms up, copy them. Okay so just pogo around the the first verse and Patrick goes ""-but I digress..."" and then you know that bit where there's that wiki-wiki guitar riff? And then ""I'm a leading man-"" that's where you start to dance- and go crazy!

, Be careful if others are head banging too- since you could end up banging heads (you know what I mean) with them which would be horribly painful, and maybe fatal if it's hard enough. Regard others, and others will regard you.

, If you're in a mosh pit and it's pretty crowded, find a friend or complying fellow mosher, cross your arms so they form an X, elbows facing the side, not down, and firmly clasp hands with your friend or fellow mosher. Using your weight to build momentum, spin around. This will make space in the pit, and other moshers or dancers will be thankful, too. But be careful!


Make sure other people see you coming, you could end up hitting lots of people. If there is a lot of space, one of you could let go and go into a high jump, but it's not recommended since you could end up either falling onto the ground, crowd, or front of the stage, if you're close enough, and that could be fatal, or at least extremely painful. As I said, be careful and thoughtful, don't hurt yourself or others.

, Hayley Williams from Paramore uses it a lot. Just think jumping, while moving around, while bending your knees and then kicking your legs out, scuffing your shoes on the floor lightly as you go. Check out some of Paramore's live performances on YouTube. You'll know the dance when you see it. Still, keep to the beat.

, What's the point in dancing with your arms glued woodenly to your sides? But don't wave them around maniacally, you'll look slightly stupid. Bending your arms very slightly and holding them loosely will allow them to ""flail"" slightly and look natural.

, Jumping looks cool, especially in a mosh pit. Jump as high as possible, with your left leg bent left, and the right leg bent to the right. It looks really awesome.

, It's great fun, and even if it only lasts for ten to fifteen seconds, it will be an awesome ten to fifteen seconds! If the venue allows it, climb onto the stage, being careful not to disrupt the band or any of the equipment, and jump, tensing your body as you fall, which will make you easier to catch.


Make sure people see you coming, otherwise you could get a face full of dirt, blood and teeth. Your own teeth. Alternatively, you could use two taller people to hoist you up, using their shoulders, not standing on their cupped hands. After all, not all venues allow stage divers and you could be ejected from the concert. Again, make sure people see you coming.
Keep your arms and legs elevated, you don't want to be booting or slapping anyone in the face! Also, keep your head up, it would be extremely painful if your head is hanging back and got caught. You could break your neck. If you feel yourself starting to go down, point your feet down so it's easier to get back on the ground, plus more comfortable.

Learn everything you can about the financial side of promoting concerts, from artists' fees to ticket receipts to the percentage that a concert promoter or venue takes.

,


If you plan on promoting concerts of a certain type of music, meet as many performers and managers in that field as possible. Focus on the city or region in which you want to work: get to know the owners and managers of concert venues, talent agents, record label representatives, and radio station managers.

,


Depending on the size of the concert and the act performing, you will need to use a variety of marketing strategies, such as posting flyers, buying radio advertisements, hosting ticket giveaways, and using social networks.

,


Because you need to hire many one-night employees for putting on a concert, it is a good idea to have an idea of your labor pool. In some cases, you may need to hire these people at the last minute.

,

Start with the venue website.,
Go To TicketMaster.,
Use The Secondary Ticket Market.",How to Buy Concert Tickets Online," Make sure you know exactly who you want to see before hand. Then go to their official website to see where they will be performing. If you don't know the official website of the artist you want to see you can always Google their name and the official website should show up. From there you can find their tour schedule and decide on which date works for you. Try to pick a venue that is close to you and make sure that they are performing on a date that doesn't conflict with anything you have going on.;
, Once you have found out where the artist you want to see will be performing look at the venue website. The website should have tickets listed so you can purchase them directly from the source that is selling them. If the event you are looking for isn't listed don't worry. Just move on to the next step to find tickets. Usually an event isn't listed on the venue website because it is either sold out or too far ahead in the future.

, Ticketmaster.com is the official seller of most venues and sports teams. If you can't find tickets on the actual venue website you can easily find the tickets you are looking for on TicketMaster. If the event is sold out or doesn't have the seats you want then you can move on to the last step which will almost guarantee you to find the tickets you want.

, If you can't find the tickets you want by using the above methods the next step is to go to the secondary ticket market.

Enjoy yourself.",How to Behave at a Rock Concert," In some stadiums or civic centers, you may have a half mile hike to arrive at your seat, and threading your way through a line of people can cause a lot of stress.;
,, These may be a very real part of the rock scene, but you should be concerned enough to behave responsibly.

, Again, this may not be the ordinary attitude for concert goers, but it will tend to make it easier to enjoy the show. Here are some things which you should note.


Do not push and shove to get to a merchandise table, food and beverage vendor, or restroom. Rock music fans are like any group, they can be laid back and mellow, or volatile and edgy.
Do not throw things, insult people, or complain to people sitting near you. If the band stinks, walk out, or if there is another group coming up, chill out and wait for them.
Don't block the view for other concert goers. If the crowd gets up and start screaming or waving their arms, join them, but don't try to do a one person show in the stands for your own entertainment.

, You may be stoked and overjoyed with the show, but you should still allow others to enjoy it in their own way.

, Some rock concerts, usually the best ones, do get a little out of control, and if you are into it, it is fine to get involved with the crowd.

, People can get very touchy on the subject of bands they like.

, Generally the best clothing to wear is that of similar bands to the headline act but as long as it's in the style of the music it's okay (e.g. black for a metal band, checkers for a ska band etc.) for most styles no-one really cares what you look like and for the ones where people do you'll probably already know the dress code.

,, Your main aim in the gig is to have fun. This depends on what your idea of fun is, if you want to be a barrier boy then you need to get onto that front barrier right at the start and never let go no matter how squashed and deafened you get. If you want to sit and not be squashed then go upstairs. If you want to be a demon of the pit then you need to rip your shirt off and start acting like a gorilla in heat. Choose where you want to fit into the gig.

Boiling Laba porridge is one way to celebrate the harvest and show appreciation by sacrificing to the ancestors and heaven and earth.;
, This is a tradition for every Chinese family to thoroughly cleanse the house as well as their clothes, bedclothes and all their utensils in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for good incoming luck. Get debts paid or repay them, get your hair cut and sew or buy new clothes as preparation. Decorate windows and doors with red color paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of good fortune, happiness, wealth and longevity.

, People in northern China will eat jiaozi, or dumplings, for supper on the Spring Festival Eve, as ""jiaozi"" is homophonous to the word phrase “to bid farewell to the old and usher in the new.” Also, the shape of the dumpling resembles gold ingot from ancient China. So people eat them and wish for money and treasures. Meanwhile, people in southern China eat niangao (New Year cake made of glutinous rice flour) on this occasion, because as a homophone, niangao means ""higher and higher, one year after another.""

, The Spring Festival gala is an essential entertainment activity for the Chinese both at home and abroad. Most families will stay up to see off the old year and welcome the New Year with their TV turned on. There were 51 galas broadcasted by local television networks throughout China in 2012.Due to varying tastes, the gala shows are often a favored background noise while people in front of their TV enjoy other family activities.

, After extending greetings to their parents, children will receive money as a New Year gift in red envelopes. In most cases, these hongbao are given to children by their elder relatives or friends of the family.

, Setting off firecrackers and fireworks is the most practiced custom during the Spring Festival. People think that the spluttering sound helps to drive away evil spirits. Once in the mid-1990s, the government took safety, noise and pollution factors into consideration and banned fireworks in major cities. Now, however, almost all cities have lifted the ban to give way for such a long-held tradition.

, Everybody dresses up. First they extend greetings to their parents, then to their grandparents and other relatives, neighbors and friends.

, The first five days after the Spring Festival are a good time for relatives, friends, classmates and colleagues to exchange greetings, gifts and chat leisurely. Friends meet together to share what have happened in their lives during the past year, talk about their plans for the coming year, and otherwise enjoy their time together.

, Most families play card games or mahjong for fun over the Spring Festival. A small sum of bet is usually placed to add excitement. Playing mahjong or poker is not only for entertainment, but also a ritual for cathartic release traditionally at the social gathering of peasants, completing the leisure activities during the holiday break.

Or tickets to major league sporting events? Where do you want to base your operations? These decisions will impact everything from which licenses you apply for to how much startup money you will need.


Think about why you will succeed. Is your local music venue not successful at advertising? Do you notice that a sports team regularly sells out their games? You should find a market you can compete in that is also profitable.;
, Once you have decided which tickets you would like to sell, you need to check into which licenses you will need. States have different laws concerning the regulation of ticket brokering. Planning out this phase will make it easy for you to begin buying and selling tickets later.


Some states require you to have a ticket reseller’s license if the concert venue is in their state., Unless you have a lot of money tucked away, you will need money to start a ticket reselling business. First, it costs several thousand dollars just to apply for license. Second, you will need to have the capital to buy tickets, even though the return is relatively fast.


Banks and credit unions are a good place to check into loans for starting businesses. See this guide for ways to find out your credit score and optimize it.
You can also try to find investors in your area. Local businesses may be interested in low-cost investments or the perks that come with having ties to a ticket broker. If you keep it small and personal, you may be able to keep lawyers and accountants out of it. See this for more tips on starting a small business.

, You should know by now where you want to list your business address, and which venues you want to sell tickets to. This varies state by state, so a simple web search will tell you where to fill out and submit the application. You will need to have a good amount of cash for any fees and bonds.


To give you an idea, the application fee for New York is $5,000.It will vary by state.
New York also requires a surety bond held by at least two sureties for the sum of $25,000. This money is on the line to ensure you fulfill your contractual obligations.
Additional information may be required. For example, New York needs to know the status of any child support payments.

, First, it requires its members to live up to some ethical standards while conducting business. It also lobbies to expand the rights and privileges of ticket resellers, so they are on your side. It is also a good way to network and have access to a pool of resources.

, There are a few sources typically approved by most states. It is important not only to follow laws when selling tickets, but buying them as well. There are hefty fines for buying tickets for resale from an unauthorized source.


The most obvious source is the venue itself.
Authorized or official resellers are businesses that the venue contracts to sell its tickets for them. This is typically a cost-cutting measure for the venue.
You can also typically buy tickets from other licensed resellers. They might be looking to reduce a surplus or believe that demand for the ticket will be lower than they had predicted.

, If you are becoming a broker as secondary or part-time job, it shouldn’t be as difficult to hold yourself back. Before you know how well you can expect certain tickets to sell, don’t sink as much money into each event. Do some shopping around and keep your profits and, more importantly, losses minimal at first. It is important to have enough capital to make it through these initial learning stages.

, This is a general rule you should always follow. It may seem like common sense, but there is no use for a ticket after the event occurs. You can’t sell them later, like day-old bread. This is where experience comes into play.


Events like the Super Bowl are a feeding frenzy for ticket brokers. If you are lucky enough to have a chance to buy tickets, grab all you can. It has proven to be a lucrative event for ticket resellers for decades.
Local music events are more hit-or-miss. You probably want to be more cautious about buying these tickets. The good news is that you will be out less money for each one you don't sell - especially compared to the Super Bowl.

, It has been regular practice for ticket brokers to buy season event tickets and resell them by the game. This may still be a viable option for some venues, but keep in mind that many sports teams and others are starting to place restrictions on this activity. Look into the rules for season ticket ownership before buying season tickets.

, In most situations, you will need people to be able to easily shop and pay for tickets from home. The most difficult aspect of this will be creating a secure portal for financial transactions. There are online payment systems that will interface fairly easily with your website. You might also look into directly taking credit card information. Check out this guide for more tips on setting up the financial part of your website.

, With social media platforms numerous and free, it is easy to spread the word about your tickets. You can also buy ad space on websites and even search engine sites for relatively cheap. If you are engaged in the local music scene, you probably want to focus on your community. If you specialize in events that attract patrons from farther away, focus on fan pages in their online community.

, Now that you have found some buyers, point them to your website. Make sure you keep up with the purchases and get them their tickets on time. Luckily, if your website interfaces with an online payment system, much of the organizational and financial work will be done automatically.

, You may have an official business address, but not want it to be open to the public. The easiest way for you to get your tickets to their buyers is probably by mail. It is inexpensive and secure. Look into business rates for sending envelopes. There are commercial prices for businesses., This is a popular way to sell certain tickets, but it is usually associated with illegal scalpers. If you are a licensed broker, you have nothing to worry about legally. There are additional laws determined by the state to control this activity, however. Check out all the laws that apply to ticket brokers in your state.


For example, in New York, you must be 500 feet (150 m) away from venues with a capacity of 5,000 or less. You must be 1,500 feet (460 m) away from venues with a capacity of more than 5,000."
"
Dress appropriately.,
Be seated before the concert begins.,
Follow all rules or guidelines set up by the concert organizers.,
Keep your cell phone switched off or on silent.,
Make sure children behave properly as well.,
Show your appreciation with applause.,
Show respect for the performers.,
Try growing your concert experiences.",How to Behave in a Concert," What you should wear varies greatly with the type of concert you're attending. For example, wearing a tuxedo to a rock concert will make you look and feel just as out of place as baggy shorts and a ratty, old T-shirt at an opera. Do your research if necessary or talk to more experienced concert-goers to figure out what you should wear before you show up.;
, Come at least fifteen minutes early to guarantee that you can arrive, claim your ticket, and find your seat well before the concert begins. If you do arrive late, then never seat yourself during a performance. Wait for the break in between songs, or for when the Emcee takes over, and only enter the concert hall or performance space when guided by an usher.

, Find these rules on your ticket or program, or ask an usher if you have questions. For smaller performances, there will often be an announcement at the beginning clarifying any rules you will be expected to follow. For example, many performances allow photography as long as there is no flash, and most prohibit video recordings.

, Having your cell phone ring loudly in the middle of the performance is a great way to disrupt the show and infuriate performers and audience members alike. Don't let this happen: keep your phone on silent, or better yet, turn it off completely. Being disconnected will also allow you to focus more on the music and enjoy the concert more fully.


Texting or otherwise using your phone during the concert is also very distracting. Your phone's bright screen is perfectly visible to anyone sitting near or behind you. Put your phone away and don't look at it until after the show.

, If you are attending a show with a small child, discuss concert etiquette before you arrive and make sure they follow these guidelines throughout the performance. Keep them from talking loudly or running around during the show. Some concerts do not permit kids below 4 years as they may not be able to endure the concert sound; check with concert organizers before bringing young children.

, It can be tempting to whoop or holler to show your appreciation for incredible performances and creative geniuses. However, this is out of place at many concerts and will be taken as rude. Restrain yourself from shouting, stomping your feet, chanting, or making other loud and disruptive displays. Instead, stick to polite applause. For a spectacular performance, you can augment this with a standing ovation, but for the most part simple applause is all that's necessary.

, Respect should be evident everywhere in your behavior, from sitting quietly and attentively during the performance to applauding politely afterwards. Make a point never to speak rudely or abuse the performers or their performance while at the concert. If you were unhappy with a certain element of the performance, keep it to yourself, or discuss it calmly and maturely with a close friend after you leave.

, Keep concert brochures, souvenirs, and any such concert materials and enhance the collection. These materials can help you remember and appreciate each concert you attend, long after it's over.

Decide which ticket works best for you and your budget.,
Use a good checklist to pack.,
Fill up your gas tank shortly before you get there.,
Consider arriving early!,
Get to the campsite.,
Plan your days.",How to Do Bonnaroo When You're Over 50," There are several ways you can ""do Bonnaroo"":


General Admission (GA) ticket will let you stay at any of the regular camping / RV areas at Bonnaroo (or shuttle in/out of the site every day if you're staying at a motel or somewhere in town). ""GA"" tickets are tiered in price according to when you buy them with about a $50 discount for the same ticket if you buy it earlier rather than later.
VIP camping ticket. Amenities include a private entrance with no traffic, showers, upgraded flushing toilets with attendants to keep them clean, an air conditioned VIP tent to rest in at the campground, a VIP dinner on Thursday night with a private performance, special viewing areas, and more.
VIP RV ticket. These are over $3000, but you get a nice RV with everything you'll need except food waiting for you. They are conveniently located right across from Centeroo plus VIP access / seating at shows (they are the lucky people you'll see in the stage wings!).;
, There's a sample one below to get you started. The Bonnaroo.com website also has a good list of what to bring (and what not to bring) for both camping and being in Centeroo for the shows. Check out the tips offered by Bonnaroo’s animated character ""Gary Chardonnay"" on YouTube...they were detailed, informative, and fun to watch. If you forget to take or run out of something, there is a General Store in Centeroo where you can get some necessities., You may have to wait in a very long line of cars for a very long time to get into Bonnaroo and/or to get out and there are no gas stations at the Bonnaroo site...it's a farm that's been converted into a giant camping area with stages for music. You can't take extra gas with you unless you have a generator (5 gals/generator).

, If you can swing it, drive to Manchester or nearby the day before the gates open, spend the night at a motel Tuesday night, get a good night’s sleep, have a nice leisurely breakfast Wednesday morning, and take the last hot shower you'll have for a while. Chattanooga to the south and Nashville to the north are within an easy hour's drive of Manchester. Get to the Bonnaroo entrance road by 2 pm or earlier.


Find a place to “hang out” until the line at the Bonnaroo gate is allowed to form and the gates open. Some families who live on the road to the entrance will let you park in their yard for a healthy fee. Or you can find a spot to park in a nearby parking lot, set up a beach chair under a tree to read, play the guitar, meet and talk to people who are also waiting, and just enjoy the afternoon. NOTE: If you try to park on the side of the road to the entrance, one of ""Manchester’s finest"" will most definitely tell you to move, which can be a problem as the number of cars waiting to get in line picks up as the afternoon goes on.
Keep a watchful eye on the line as it may officially start to form before the announced time. (You can tell if this is happening when there are cars slowly moving forward and no cars are coming back that are being turned away from the gate in the outbound lane). As nice as everyone going to Bonnaroo can be, even the most laid back driver can get aggravated if you try to cut in line. If the line has already formed by the time you realize it, just smile, give the “peace sign”, and ask someone nicely to let you in and it probably won’t be a problem. If that doesn't work, try offering a couple of cans of cold beer to the driver (just make sure they’re over 21) to sweeten the request.
The people controlling the entrance usually make the decision to open for admission (not just letting the line start to form) at about 4 pm...3 hours before the time posted on the website. Apparently this happens almost every year so all the better to get there early.
If you don't arrive early (by late Wednesday afternoon), be prepared for a long, slow line to get to the Bonnaroo gate through Friday morning. Stories of people waiting in their cars to get into the gate for ""as little as"" 6 hours to as long as 12 hours are common. So consider arriving early!
Once you’re in the gate, you’ll be asked to get out of your car so that people can do a security check for ""prohibited items"". Be nice to these people, it’s a tough job going through the stuff in about 50,000 cars in the Tennessee heat! They probably won’t do much more than a quick scan to look for pets, weapons, fireworks, or an excessive number of glass bottles (all prohibited, among other things). But keep in mind that the security searchers can go through everything if they want to do that and can confiscate anything that’s on the “prohibited” list. Once you get through the security check, you’ll be directed to the admissions stations. Have your wrist bracelet ready. They will scan it and put it on you.

, It helps if you've already looked at a map of the Bonnaroo campgrounds (which you can find through a Google search online) and know the camping area you want to go to. There are several specially designated camping areas for non-VIP RVs (additional charge above ticket price), tent-only camping (you'll have to carry your stuff from your vehicle to that area, but it's adjacent to Centeroo), special access camping for people with mobility impairments, family camping, and then tent + vehicle camping everywhere else. Unless you want to pretend like you’re 20 again, ask to be directed to the family camping area (usually this is at Balloon Marker #7.) It’s in reasonably close walking distance of Centeroo where everything happens and is quieter and roomier than the other camps (especially if you get there on the early side). Make a wide berth when you’re pulling in next to the car that came in before you to leave as much space as you can between your car and that one, for both your “stuff” and for a little more privacy. No matter where you camp, meeting your neighbors is part of the fun of Bonnaroo...but having a little space between them and you is a good thing.


Set up your campsite quickly. You’ll have plenty of time over the next 5 days to see what’s going on at Centeroo, so go ahead and get your tent and equipment set up while it’s still light. When you're setting your tent up, notice where the sun is and set your tent up on the west side of your car to give yourself a little more time in the morning to sleep before the sun and heat wake you up and force you out of your tent! If you need help setting up, ask any of the volunteers and paid staff in your camp area (under the white canopies next to the road). They are there 24 hours a day from Wednesday through Monday and are really helpful. Once your tent is up, your air mattress is inflated, and your camping stuff is organized, sit down with a nice cold beverage and get your bearings so you’ll know how to get back to your camp, and most importantly find out where the port-a-potties and water troughs are.
Leave your coolers in your car or in your tent. The blazing near-summer-solstice Tennessee sun will melt ice (including dry ice) in even the best-insulated cooler pretty quickly. A good idea is to FREEZE all of your water bottles before you leave and put them in your coolers. They don't get slushy when they melt and water down your food and they actually stay frozen pretty well for the duration if they're solidly frozen when you pack them. Plus you can take the ones that are thawing sooner to have ice cold bottled water. There are vendors on the vehicle roads in the campground areas who sell ice from large trailers for about $3.50 per 10-lb bag.
Secure your stuff and your vehicle. Be sure to keep valuables in your locked car. Leave at least one car window cracked a little bit to let super-heated air vent and put up windshield shades and reflectors. If you don't, don't be surprised if your windshield cracks from 4 days in the sun and high heat in the car. Keep a spare key to your car with you or hidden in your tent. Bonnaroo security will not let AAA come into the campgrounds until Sunday night when the shows are over. There are paid and volunteer staff at tents for each camping area who can help you if you need first aid treatment or a jump start for your car, but they can’t help you if you lock your keys in the car. These people are all friendly, helpful, and definitely worth a few minutes of time to visit.

, Now you're settled into your campsite you can turn your attention to everything going on over the next 4 days! There is almost non-stop entertainment going on in Centeroo from Thursday morning through late Sunday evening (although a lot of things slow down/stop between 4 am and 9 am). Go over the schedule and mark the times/places of the things you definitely want to see. Unless there’s a long break between things you want to see that would make it worth the time and effort to walk up the hill back to your campsite, it’s easier just to stay the whole day in Centeroo, > if < you’re prepared. Since you're not 20 and not willing to rough it quite as much as they do, get the right mix of things to take with you to get through a 12-hour stay at Centeroo. Recommendations:


2, 1-liter bottles (or 4 smaller bottles) of cold water. Plan on taking time to get to a water station to refill the empties between shows. It’s important to drink water steadily throughout the day so that you don’t get dehydrated. Vendors sell fresh lemonade and cold beer (about $5. each) which are nice to get occasionally. Bottled water is $2.50 for a small bottle. Some people use a “camel” backpack that you can put water in and carry like a backpack, you might like having yours colder than that.
Either a hand-held misting fan or a spray (mist) bottle and something to fan with is good for cooling heated skin. You'll be amazed at how good it feels.
A large beach towel to sit on. It doesn't weigh much and you can also use it to create some shade or cover up parts of your body that may be getting too much sun. A low beach chair is nice to have but it’s a bit of a pain to lug around. If you take one, use one of the portable wheeled-carriers to carry it and your other stuff.
Hand towel and bandana for mopping sweat and to cover exposed body parts that may be baking in the sun. Also to get wet and put on top of your head to lower your body temp a bit.
A hat with a brim to keep the top of your head from getting sunburned and to keep some of the sun off your face.
Sunscreen (Do not underestimate the intensity of being in the sun all day. Going through the rest of Bonnaroo with painful sunburn will really kill the fun). Remember to re-apply, especially to the backs of your arms and tops of your feet since the sun is overhead and all of your skin that’s not covered up is getting sun throughout the day.
Snacks. The vendor food is okay (everything is about $5). But if your digestive system isn’t programmed to handle jalapeno corn dogs and NY spicy pizza all day, take snacks with you like beef jerky, carrot sticks, apples, trail mix, and protein drinks.
A small camera. Unless your main focus is to take photos of the Bonnaroo sights (and there are plenty!) more than listening to the music, don't take your DSLR with the good walk around zoom lens. it just adds extra weight to what you are carrying around and is generally a nuisance and could easily get stolen. Use a disposable camera, a small digital camera, or the camera on your cell phone to take snapshots. Take a ziploc bag to put your camera and your cell phone in if it rains.
A charged cell phone (especially if you’re by yourself), set on “vibrate”. it's impossible to hear when bands are playing but you can feel it if it’s set on “vibrate” and keep it close to you. Text people you know there from time to time so you know where everyone is located and in case anyone needs help. (There's a phone re-charging station in Centeroo but be prepared to wait in line for at least an hour. Suggest that you sit in your car with the engine on and air conditioning running when it's hot outside and recharge it.)
ID and about $50 cash. Especially if you're on your own, write down where you are parked/camped, car license number, and who to contact in case of emergency. Keep it with you where someone can find it easily. Having this info physically on you could save precious time if something happens. Don't bring your wallet with driver’s license, credit cards, all your cash, etc. in case it gets lost or stolen.
Fold-up umbrella. You’ll be glad (REALLY glad!) to have it if you’re out in the sun for most of the afternoon to create some shade that you can control. Shade is limited in Centeroo, especially around the concert stages, and gets filled up very quickly. The umbrella is also useful if it rains, even if only for a few minutes.
Wet-wipes and small roll of toilet paper. Expect every port-a-potty to be very messy, gross, and without toilet paper. Use the wet wipes to clean off the toilet seat and bring your own toilet paper to use. Leave plenty of time to make a pit stop as there are usually long lines of people waiting for the port-a-potties.






Schedule and map that you get at the entrance gate. There are a few places that have them displayed but they’re not easy to spot. You can get really disoriented quickly when you don’t what’s playing, where it’s playing, or how to get there.

Don't accept drugs or other potentially dangerous substances.,
Have a parent or other trusted adult drop you off and pick you up afterwards.,
If you're riding the bus home, sit in the front.,
Take the bus instead of walking.",How to Be Safe at a Concert (Teen)," Although this doesn't directly apply to safety, you don't want to overheat and pass out. Wear light clothes and avoid bogging yourself down with multiple layers of clothing. You'll be sweating a lot, so consider wearing darker colors to conceal your sweat stains.;
, Drink plenty of water prior to the concert to avoid getting dehydrated and passing out. You'll be sweating, so your body will need lots of water to replenish its lost fluids.

, You are at the risk of getting mugged on the way to/from the concert as well as when you're there, so be sure to hide your money. Consider putting it in your front pocket, your shoe, or another place that makes it harder to steal. Also, avoid flashing your money around. If people see you with large sums of money, you could become a target., This is an important safety tip, since there's safety in numbers. Attend the concert with at least one friend. Carpool there or plan to meet at the venue or bus station.

, You should have a good meal at least an hour before the concert. This will give your stomach time to digest the food so that you don't get over-excited and throw up at the concert.

, Security guards will watch for you, but take a moment to scope out the area and find the nearest security guard, just in case.

, If someone seems strange, keep an eye on them. Some people just give off weird vibes or make you feel uncomfortable. If this is the case, try to move away from them if possible. If they follow you, alert security.

, Know that people might be smoking weed. Usually people avoid doing drugs around kids, but this is not always the case. If people are doing drugs, let a security guard know. If someone asks you if you want a hit, politely decline. If someone offers you any substances, just say no, and try not to make a big deal about it unless they do. If they persist, report them to security.

, Getting driven to and from the concert is safer than walking or taking the bus, even if you're with friends. Set a meeting place close to the venue to avoid confusion.

, This applies to the subway as well. Always stay in the front, near the operator. You should try to get your parent to pick you up once you arrive at the terminal/bus stop.

, Even if Google Maps is telling you to walk down a block to get to your bus stop, take the closest bus, then get off and make your connection to whatever bus or train you need to go home.

,
Proceed from the parking area carefully.",How to Attend a Concert," This will ensure that you are quick to find out about the latest 'gigs' in time to buy tickets. Not all shows are advertised on the radio or paper.


Some ticket and tour sites allow you to sign up for cell updates whenever your favorite artists add new dates in your area.;
,, When you hear about a concert you're interested in, check ticket availability. Many popular concerts may sell out before you get a chance to buy your tickets.


Don't assume it is sold out until you are told so by the venue
Talk to people with similar music interests as you. They are likely to know about upcoming shows.
Venues often release ""hold"" tickets a day or two before the show. These are tickets the band or promoter has ""held back"" and must be offered for sale if not used. Keep checking back.
Bands that are growing in popularity may still be playing smaller venues. Although this is a great time to see them you should plan on getting your tickets early as possible.

, This will increase your safety and make for an altogether more enjoyable experience.


Start asking around when you hear about the show.
Coordinate who will buy the tickets since buying them individually will mean you sit apart. (Unless it is a general admission show.)
Keep in contact with your friends after you've decided to go. Make sure no one changes their minds or makes other plans and you buy a ticket for them.

, Either go through the venue website, the band website, an authorized ticket website or authorized ticket site, such as the box office. Compare prices between websites to confirm you are getting your tickets at a reasonable price.


Booking online or in person will offer you the same chance for good tickets. Spending the night outside the venue no longer offers the opportunities for good seats, unless general admission for this venue means standing room close to the stage. In this case, the earlier you get to the venue the higher the likelihood that you will be front and center.
Find out the date and time tickets go on sale and try to book at that time.
Online sites may offer bad seats for your first search. Unless the show is a guaranteed sell out you can usually refresh the search a few times and find better tickets.
If your under 18, have a parent or adult guardian purchase the tickets for you, this doesn't have to mean they spend their money, you can pay them back.
Buying smaller numbers of tickets will usually result in better seats. Trying to buy 10 tickets at once will probably have nosebleed seats.
Purchases online require a credit card. Box office purchases can usually use cash or credit.

,


You can avoid some fees by getting an e-ticket that you can print. These are easy to duplicate and since you don't know if it's valid until it is scanned people may shy away from buying your ticket should you need to sell.
Most venues offer ""Will Call"" service. This is when you buy your ticket and have it waiting for you at the venue for pick up.

Will Call will require you show a driver's license and the credit card used to buy the tickets.
Most require the names match on the credit card, the driver's license and the name the tickets are being held.
You should avoid waiting until the day of the show to pick up your will call tickets. Lines will be long and you won't have time to correct a mistake (such as your tickets not being there but your card was charged).
Picking up your tickets from Will Call ahead of time also gives you an option should an emergency happen and you must sell your tickets on short notice. Since the buyer can't pick up your tickets from will call.
The Will Call window is usually open during the box office's regular business hours and extended hours the day of the show.
Smaller venues may have later hours and not offer Will Call service. Call and ask before you assume.



,, Most concerts are outside and it won't be fun if you don't come prepared and it is raining while you didn't bring a raincoat. Listen to the radio, watch the weather forecast on TV or even check the internet.

, Having an early night means that you won't look awful and that means you will be able to enjoy the concert without falling asleep in the middle of the concert. Sleep is very important so it would be ideal if you have 8 to 10 hours of sleep.

, Check that everyone is coming and no one has anything to do that day or that they are ill. This means that you and your friends can sort out how much money they need to bring and that they know what transport you are getting to the concert e.g train, bus, car.

If A teacher and students are coming with you, pick your best friend to stay with when the teacher is unavailable., The venue website can also update you of changes.


Some bands actually go on stage at the time indicated on the ticket. There might be opening acts before the main artist performs, but don't arrive too late.
Country bands, adult contemporary artist and more family oriented events will start closer to the ticket time or at the ticket time.

,


Some concerts and bands have a fan base which likes to tailgate (huge parking lot party) before the show. The venue can tell you if this is expected for the show you are attending. These festivities can start in the morning and go until show time. Plan to leave early, take food, beverage, toilet paper and a change of clothes. Don't leave your belongings unattended or your car unlocked.

, Make a schedule and share it with anyone attending with you.


Plan your wardrobe ahead of time
Withdraw a reasonable amount of cash from the ATM.
Pack your tickets, ID, money, cell phone, camera (if allowed), parking passes or any other confirmations.
Try to eat before you leave since food at concert venues is usually poor quality or very expensive.

, Once you have your tickets, you may be surprised by the number of people going who you know. Usually, the larger the group the better, and this cuts down on parking fees, gas, etc.


Arrange a neutral meeting place, perhaps someone's house with adequate parking and centrally located.
Determine a mutually agreeable time to meet for the carpool. Habitually late friends should be told an earlier time.
Larger cities offer mass transit to the venue. Leave early enough to avoid the rush just before show time.

, Dress in layers and consider a light jacket if it's cold. If you are attending at an outdoor venue then consider the weather in advance. The chances are that you will be standing around for a great deal of time waiting for something to happen.


Avoid wearing high heels or sandals. These will feel very uncomfortable as you are standing up for most of the day. High heels will give you a risk you having a twisted ankle. Sandals won't give you a broken ankle but you will still feel uncomfortable or have your toes trodden on. Trainers or sneakers are the best to wear for the concert.
If you bring a jumper or coat these should be stored in the cloakroom facility as it is too hot to wear.
If you are female, try not to wear anything that might get sexual attention if you don't want it, it's honestly not your fault if you do, just a extremely handy tip.
Avoid wearing too much makeup. This won't look great if you are crying or sweating. Sometimes the place of concert can get very hot. If possible don't wear it at all. If you don't feel comfortable without it, then just wear waterproof products and use a little bit.
Not all venues have coat checks and the ones that do may be very busy before an after the show. It's best you bring something manageable.

, Assume your bag will be searched upon entering the venue. Some bands and venues also have attendees patted down or frisked for weapons or prohibited items. They will have women pat down women and men for checking other men. Listen to instructions on the way in and the process should only take a few seconds.


Hide your camera if you forgot to leave it in the car.
Try to carry a bag that is easy to manage while at the show. The less you carry, the better.
Bags should be worn over your head or easily fit between feet on the floor. The best bags close completely to avoid being picked as you walk through the crowd.

, Should you leave your seat for any reason you may be asked to show your ticket to return. You also may be subject to ticket searches once you have already been seated.


If you often leave your seats to mosh, dance, cruise the crowd, etc., store your items in pockets or with a friend and leave your bag at home.

, You will not be admitted with it and thrown out if you are caught with it.

, Some larger, international bands have started prohibiting phones in concerts because of the video and camera options. Check with the venue or artist sites for any drastic bans on items.


Smoking is prohibited in most venues. Some offer exterior or smoking areas. Be considerate and observe the rules regardless of the behavior of those around you.

, This is important if there is an emergency or if you and your friends get split up. Use the phone to call each other.

, Use your usual toiletries.

, Bring a small bag if possible. If you have a big bag it can get in people's way and it can weigh you down if you are in the standing area or waiting for the gates to open. All you need is money, phone, a snack, your travel card and the tickets.

, You will be going to the concert until late at night and it is good to eat something.


The concert will last until late at night and having food in your stomach means that you won't be likely to feel sick in the middle of the concert. Food at the venue is really expensive so it is ideal you go somewhere to get something to eat.

, Notify them of anyone doing anything dangerous, improper or illegal.

, If they aren't allowed you should use common sense and discretion before attempting to take photographs.


They may ask you to stop, confiscate your property or detain you for a portion of the show.
You may be able to plead ignorance once but don't abuse the warning. Apologize, put your camera away and don't let them see it again. Most security or staff would prefer to warn you than throw you out but don't push your luck by ignoring the warning.
Video is usually more frowned upon than pictures and bring about swifter actions by the staff.
Photos taken with camera phones are still photos. They may confiscate your phone.
If you are able to get it back that night, it may be damaged, missing the sim card, in a box with 20 other phones that look just like yours and not available until an hour or more after the show.

, Many people enjoy them, it gives you more bang for your money and it is a great way to see up and coming artists. Although sometimes these are smaller bands they are usually a style of music which compliments the headliner. If you are not interested, now would be a good time to locate your friends.

,


Buying early gives you the best selection of band merchandise for sale.

, If you get dehydrated, you are likely to faint or feel dizzy. Drink water now and then. Keep a water bottle with you if you need it.

, Merchandise tables, beer and wine sales, concession stands often close before the show ends. Don't assume you will get it on the way out. It may not be available.


Plan to arrive early to buy merchandise, especially if a coat check or cloak room is offered. If you buy a t-shirt place it inside a jacket pocket to save having to pay for two cloakroom passes.

, Many people leave early or before the final encore and the house lights go up. Feel free to stay and enjoy the show. You may even be able to slip into a now vacant seat for the finale.


You came to the concert to have fun, so be sure to enjoy the music. Make sure that you take lots of photos at the concert, so that you can look back on it in the future!

Try to purchase front row tickets the minute they go on sale.,

Bring the proper supplies.,
Reduce your liquid intake a few hours before the concert.,
Take the path of least resistance.,

Dance, sing, and have fun.",How to Get Front Row at a Concert," If the concert venue or the musical artist has a mailing list, sign up. Often times, they'll offer pre-sale tickets which can increase your chances of getting a limited front row spot. If you're willing to shell out a little more, you can also look into purchasing a VIP package that often comes with premium seating.Whether you're trying to purchase via pre-sale or regular sale, make sure to set your alarm and be on the ticket website right when tickets go on sale. The faster you are, the more tickets you'll have to choose from.


If there are no front row tickets available, you can try the ""high risk, high reward"" approach of waiting until the day of the concert to check again. Some venues will release more premium seats right before doors open. Typically these are tickets that the artist or venue management reserved that ended up being unused.
Sometimes you can even find front row tickets through scalpers or CraigsList. However, you may not be able to get tickets until right before the concert, and buying them from an unauthorized vendor comes with risks.;
, Sometimes this is only an hour before the show begins, and other times it's hours. Depending on how committed you are to getting a spot in the front row, you should get there as early as you can.You can stake out a prime spot before the venue begins to fill up. This, of course, is the easiest way to get a front row spot without fighting through crowds.


Sometimes, you have to take this step to the extreme and camp out before a big concert. You may have to camp out in a line to get your front row tickets. You can learn all about camping out overnight here!

Arriving super early or camping out can turn a simple concert into a weekend-long event. Bring your favorite friends, and make it a party.

, If it’s an outdoor venue, you may be able to claim your territory with picnic blankets or lawn chairs. Sunscreen and a water bottle (if allowed) are also helpful so you can stay in your spot comfortably. If it’s indoor and standing room only, you’ll need to wear comfortable shoes so you can post up pain-free. Look up the venue beforehand, so you know what to expect and which items are allowed.


It's also important to consider the venue to ensure that you dress appropriately. If you're going to be squeezed into a small bar, you may want to wear less clothing so you don't overheat. If you're going to an outdoor concert, you may want to bring a jacket for chillier temperatures after the sun sets.Another ""supply"" you should bring is a good cell phone battery. You'll want a fully-charged cell phone to make sure it lasts for the whole concert. You do not want to risk getting separated from your friends without a cell phone.

, This sounds ridiculous, but there is no way you’ll be able to hold your spot if you’re running off to the bathroom. Not only does “dibs” not work at a concert, but you’ll also have to fight through crowds of people and stand in long lines. To avoid this, just ease up on the water or booze in plenty of time.Sometimes bathroom trips are unavoidable. That’s OK! Unless you’re at the concert alone, you can take turns in the bathroom with whoever you’re with. That way one person can hold the spot.

, It’s probably not wise to charge straight through the middle of the crowd. Instead, try to get as close to the front as you can by weaving down the side of the crowd, along the perimeter. Once you’ve gotten as close to the front as you can with that method, try shimmying your way into the crowd sideways.People will probably be more willing to let you through when you are coming from the side, rather than rushing them from behind. They’ll likely think you’re finding a new spot, rather than cutting in front of people

, This is especially important in packed venues, where there is a risk of getting separated and lost from the people you came with. Link hands so you can weave through the crowd as a chain. You won’t be able to walk side by side in a crowd, so just firmly join hands to stay together.


If the crowd is more aggressive, there is always a chance that you will get separated from your friends. In these situations, it's important that everyone has cell phones so you can safely find each other. If there is no cell phone service at the venue, make sure you have a designated meeting spot!

, This is most important for the person at the front of your linked chain. You have to be a little forceful to get around people, but you should still be saying ""please"" and ""thank you."" People will be much more inclined to help you if you treat them respectfully.


If someone won’t budge even after you say “please,” then you can get a little sassy.
Don't feel shy about speaking up and forcing your way through people. Chances are you'll never see those people again, but you will always remember seeing the artist up close.

, You’ll never maintain your spot in the front row if you’re leaving to stand in line at the concession stand. Even if you send a friend to fetch the beverages, you run the risk of being overtaken by a larger group of concert-goers, or being permanently separated from your friend. If you can, ditch the beer to ensure you keep your spot.If the venue is less crowded, smaller, or just easier to navigate in general, feel free to take your chances.
The rebellious concert-goers can try bringing a flask. If it doesn't get confiscated on your way in, it can help you preserve your good spot and save you money.

, If you look meek and unsure of yourself, other concert-goers behind you and to the side of you will have no issue bumping into you and taking your spot. Instead, stand confidently to claim your space. Keep your legs hip width apart and your shoulders pulled back. Hold your head high. Don’t be afraid to take up your rightful, front row space.If concert-goers are bumping into you or trying to steal your spot despite your power stance, have a powerful attitude to match. Speak up! Make steady eye contact, and tell them to back up.

, If you’re in the front row, you’ve got to prove that you deserve to be there! If you’re standing solemnly with your arms crossed and looking disinterested, the more hardcore fans will likely usurp your space. Dance, sing along, and go crazy at the concert. And if you’ve got the front row, how could you not be having fun?!


Put your phone away! It can be fun to snap a few pictures or videos, but it can also be annoying to everyone around you. Enjoy the live music you're experiencing, and put your phone away until later."

Choose suitable bags to carry your stuff in.,

Keep toiletries to a minimum.,

Prepare for the journey to the festival.,
When you return to your car after the festival you're likely to be exhausted, hungry, cold and possibly soaking wet.",How to Pack for a Festival," Consider how you'll be moving around the festival and the distance from your car to the site you're either going to be sitting at or setting up a camp on. In most cases, backpacks are your best and easiest option. Suitcases will be hard to carry for any distance and tend to be bulky when moving past crowds of people and forget taking anything with wheels; the wheels will easily get bogged and won't turn over fields.


A trolley or a wheelbarrow could be helpful if you have space for such but only use something sturdy that has big wheels, especially if you're expecting mud.
As well as the large bag, consider also having a small bag that you can carry your stuff in during the day when moving about the festival; either that or have clothing with large pockets unless pickpocketing is an issue, in which case keep all valuables secure, such as money in a money bag.
CamelBak® packs can be great for festivals because they're hydration packs that allow you to carry water that can be obtained through an attached tube.;
, You're obviously going to need a tent and sleeping bags. There are all sorts of mattresses available now that are lightweight; try picking one that doesn't require a pump to inflate it to make your life easier and to reduce the amount of items you need to carry in. For the lighter option, just sleep on your clothes. Pillows may seem like a luxury item but they make camping so much nicer and you can put it between your backpack and your back to carry it into the festival. Or, look for small camping pillows that can be scrunched up for carrying and that fluff out for use.

, Festival clothing should be funky and fun- anything goes! However, you should also be considerate of the weather possibilities and be ready for all types of weather. Unless it's guaranteed not to rain, avoid wearing jeans as they just get clogged with mud and are miserable to be wearing if you're soaked through. Instead, wear shorts or short skirts and leggings/tights with Wellington boots (gumboots, rain boots) or lightweight pants used for hiking or biking purposes usually (choose ones that wash and dry quickly).


Sandals aren't recommended if you're planning on getting close to the stage - your toes will get squashed! Choose shoes or boots that protect your precious feet and toes should someone manage to stomp on them. Have flip flops or sandals for shower facilities though (if there are any) as you shouldn't stand in public bathing facilities without something on your feet.
Some form of raincoat, poncho, or other rain gear is a good idea for the inevitable shower when you know the forecast promises such. Otherwise, you can easily fashion one from a bin bag, so be sure to throw some in for all purposes.
A bandanna is a versatile accessory. It can be worn wet to cool you down and if you purchase one that has been impregnated with insect repellent, it'll keep the bugs off too. Plus, it keeps your hair out of your eyes and it looks cool.

, Ideally this should be a collapsible water-carrier but a large soft drink bottle will do if you don't already have a water bottle. If the water bottle doesn't already have a carrying mechanism, purchase or make one so that you don't have to actually hold the water all day but can hang it on your body so that it doesn't bother you.

, You're going to need to eat. How much food you take in and how much you buy there depends on (a) how much surplus cash you've got (b) how close to the stage your tent will be and (c) how much you're prepared to lug around with you. Here are some ideas for being self-sufficient:

If you're cooking you'll need to take along a compact and safe camping stove with fuel, a saucepan, and plastic/lightweight bowls, plates and cutlery. Another option is to take a flask and buy boiling water from stands at the festival to cook with (noodles and other instant food can be made by simply adding hot water to a bowl). And a can or tin opener is often handy to have (but if you have a Swiss army knife, this should suffice).






Rice, pasta,ramen noodles, and couscous come in a variety of ""add boiling water"" varieties. Try to pick at least one that come in a bowl/tub so you don't need to take so much crockery with you. Pot noodles work well, as do cuppa soups and instant custard.






Other food that won't spoil and requires no cooking includes: pepperoni, sachets of tuna, biltong/jerky, hot dogs, cheese strings/small cheeses, squeezy yoghurts, actimels, nuts/raisins/trail mix, lunchbox-sized smoothies, pita breads, breakfast or muesli/granola bars, chocolates/sweets and of course Pringles chips - the tubes protect them from being crumbed and can even double-up as an emergency loo in the middle of the night!






If you want hot drinks, consider packing teabags, coffee (pack it in a coin bag from the bank or small snack bag that seals), hot chocolate, powdered milk and any sweeteners.







, Festivals wouldn't be festivals without plenty of booze. As with the food there's usually plenty to purchase on-site, but if you're taking your own then here's how to do it: don't take anything in a glass bottle. If it's found it will be confiscated owing to the potential dangers of broken glass hurting other people. Take beer or cider in cans, wine in boxes and decant spirits into small empty water bottles. If you're not fussy about the taste you can reduce your baggage weight by taking in concentrate for mixers such as orange squash and Ribena (blackcurrant cordial).


Remember to pack an empty bottle to mix your drinks in.
You may also need energy drinks or energy and vitamin drink sachets.
Know beforehand if the festival doesn't allow you to bring your own alcohol.

, Everyone starts smelling the same during a festival, so this isn't the time to be overly fussed. Bring your toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush or comb, deodorant and for women, sanitary pads or tampons if needed. These should be all the items you need – leave the night creams and aftershaves at home. A small quick dry towel is a good idea if you intend using showers at the festival.

Bring along sunscreen and bug repellent. Sunscreen can melt in the heat so keep it wrapped in newspaper and keep it in the shade. Some festivals hand out sunscreen or provide it ""on tap"" to avoid leakage problems.







Baby wipes will keep you and your cooking utensils clean. Try to make as many things dual purpose as possible.






Pack plasters (mainly in case you get blistered feet), headache relief and throat lozenges along with any other medication you'll need.






You may want to have earplugs ready either for watching really loud bands or just if you want to get some sleep.







, With a simple kit, you can come up with a solution to many broken or forgotten items. Pack duct tape, safety pins, string, elastic bands, pegs (clothes pins) and a whole roll of heavy duty bin bags. Bin bags have a multitude of uses - you can sit on them, make a raincoat, line your wellies (rain boots) if they split and to keep muddy clothes contained.


Other general items you might find handy to take include: Toilet paper rolls, a Swiss army knife, lighter, torch/flashlight (wind-up ones are great), portable phone charger (solar is perfect), zip-bags (to keep phone etc., dry in the rain), camera (with extra batteries/memory card), and cash in small denominations (changing large amounts is a pain at festivals).

, Depending on what sort of festival you're off to, you may want to pack some of these more random items:



Flags, signs or placards

Fancy-dress, face-paint, wings, jewelry, makeup, temporary tattoos, etc.
Magazine or novel, a pack of cards, games
Glowsticks
Binoculars
Picnic basket
Umbrella

Vodka watermelon or oranges
Cigarettes (or make this the time to quit!)
Condoms
Disposable barbecue
Cooler bag
Friend's addresses for sending postcards from the festival.

, Kids generally love festivals but it does require extra preparation to ensure they'll be happy and safe while there. Bike trailers are ideal to wheel them around in with all their 'stuff', but make sure you take a padlock or it will be nabbed by passing drunken revelers! Take a marker to write your mobile number on their arms, clothing and earmuffs for when they get sleepy or lost. Be sure to explain to them what they should do and where they should head for should they get lost at any time. Having rules in place about wandering etc., is much better than being wise in hindsight.


Take things to entertain them that don't make too much noise, don't require batteries and don't have lots of parts. Things like bubbles, poi, stilts and sparklers are great fun.
Make sure they've got their own camera (even if it's just a disposable one), their favourite teddy (well named and with a phone number or email if lost!) and a fancy-dress costume.
Have some sweets (candies) or other treats especially for your kids.

, You'll need: Tickets, the festival location, a map/satnav/GPS unit, breakdown cover number (you may want to check that your breakdown service covers you for onward travel, some will just take you back home if you break down). If your car is small you may want to invest in roof bars and a roofbox. You may also need bungee cords to strap tents and other items to the roof.


Remember your sunglasses, in-car charger for your phone, and take CDs of bands who're playing at the festival to get you in the mood.
Collect treats/individual milks/salt and pepper and other condiments, etc. from service stations on the way.
When you arrive, text yourself the car-park location number as you're bound to have forgotten it in several days time!

, Pack a bag of warm, clean comfy clothes, fluffy socks, a bottle of pop, snacks, a towel and some gentle chill-out music to leave in the car. Doing this will make your journey home much more pleasurable and it's something to look forward to in the middle of feeling muddy and cold or too hot!

Cooperate.",How to Crowd Surf," If you know you're going to want to crowd surf, choose your clothes carefully. It'll help reduce the likelihood of injury to the audience. Less injury to the audience means less backlash towards you.


Wear soft shoes and tie them as tightly as possible. If you accidentally kick someone in the head, they might try to take at least one of your shoes (especially if you're wearing a hard shoe), so you should be prepared.
Don't wear anything with zippers or studs. They can get caught in people's hair or scratch them on the face or hands.
Don't wear loose clothing, such as an unzipped jacket or a cap. They will be taken or dropped.
Keep the jewelry to an absolute minimum. Rings, bracelets, even tongue studs can cause damage to you or someone around you when you're trying to crowd surf, so leave them at home.
Give your wallet and phone to someone that you know and trust. This means someone that you didn't meet the day of the concert.;
, This is probably the hardest thing you will have to do when trying to crowd surf, especially if you're a bit heavy. If the security is allowing you to get close enough, get up on stage and jump off into the crowd. Most of the time, this won't be allowed, though, so have a backup plan. If you are there with somebody else, ask them to pick you up. If you're not, ask someone nicely if they could give you a boost. You'll probably have to ask more than one person. See Tips.

, Look before you dive to make sure the people you're going to land on actually see you. Tense up momentarily as you land on the crowd to make yourself easier to support. Put your feet up higher than the rest of your body to keep from kicking people, and keep the flailing to an absolute minimum. Put your arms out and elevate your head, just in case you fall. It'd be better to fall on your back and get bruised up than to fall on your head and end up with a concussion.

, This will be hard to do, considering you are putting your life in other people's hands (literally!), but it's all you can do. If you're screaming and kicking about, people will get angry at you, and will either steal something off of you, or, if you're being really annoying, actually strike you. You'll probably be in the air for about 5 seconds, but it'll probably be your 5 most exhilarating seconds at the concert.

, In most cases, you'll be carried to a barrier in front of the stage, where security officers will get you on your feet and send you back to the crowd. In some venues, or some specific artists can also demand this, crowd surfing is not allowed, so you may be kicked out of the place. If you see a lot of people (more than 2) crowd surfing, it is probably allowed, but always ask to any security person, or call the venue the day before to make sure you will be able to do it.

Festival passes can be purchased online at http://www.coachella.com/festival-passes. Follow the instructions provided there.
The festival pass consists of a wristband, which permits general admission for the whole weekend. This pass needs to be worn at all times, including when using the shuttle, parking and camping grounds (see next).
If you like, you can register the wristband online. There are benefits to doing this, such as ""enhanced customer support, social media features, merchandise specials and potential upgrades."";
, Think lots of cars needing a park and you'll need to get either a pass for parking or car camping or a shuttle pass, or perhaps one of each. There are also passes for camping and there are special travel packages. Check the website address noted in the previous step.


Note that passes, decals and related items are usually posted to your home or business address in March, prior to the festival.
Note that day parking is free. You are absolutely encouraged to carpool to reduce the number of cars and to help keep this festival as sustainable as possible. Or, take a shuttle.
Pedestrian access is available. See the site for details.

, There are camping options on site, which consist of car camping, tent camping, campsites at Lake El Dorado and safari tents. There are also plenty of hotels, motels, vacation rentals and offsite camping options within the area.


There are also different modes of travel to get there (car, plane, bus). The nearest airport is Bermuda Dunes airport which is 15 minutes from the gate. Van Nuys Airlines (http://vannuysairlines.com) is providing charter flights hourly. The alternative is Palm Springs Airport or taking a shuttle from LAX (1.5 hours).

, This is California and even at this time of year, it's going to be considerably hot under the brilliant sunshine, so a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential.


If you have one, bring a medium (20"" tall, 15"" wide and 9"" thick packed) hiking backpack. You're not allowed to bring in food or water but you can bring in an empty (non-metallic) bottle to fill at the water fountains. It gets hot out there and the main thing you'll want, but won't want to pay for, is water.
Bring all the normal hiking gear. You'll be standing and walking around for a good 12 hours each day (the festival generally runs from 11:00am until around 12:30xm). Ideal items to include: hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, chapstick, insect repellent, any medication, small face washer or wipes for messes and anything else you think you'll need. And always bring a poncho or raincoat, in case. (Check the weather forecast online for the upcoming days.)
Strollers for infants and toddlers are permitted.
Bring your dancing shoes. They're totally required and they're permitted.
As tempting as it may be to dress eccentrically, (think glitter, skin-tight dresses, skinny jeans, leather, heels, etc.) you will definitely regret it. Anyone who's ever been to a festival will agree that a t-shirt, shorts and sneakers will make a huge impact your ability to unwind and fully enjoy all the sights and sounds.
Know what you can and cannot take. There is an extensive list available here: http://www.coachella.com/festival-info. In particular, you might be surprised to find you cannot bring in food, water, a blanket, camel pack, instruments, chairs, no Sharpies or markers, no video cameras and no professional cameras. However, your are allowed to take photos and film video on your iPhone, Android, etc. Things that won't surprise you include no weapons, chains, pets, drugs or fireworks. No umbrellas either because they block people's view.
There will be plenty of shade tents to snuggle under together.

, It's important to get a good notion of what is happening where and when, so that you don't miss out on the seeing the bands that interest you most.


There are so many good bands that you've got to make some tough choices that your friends may not agree with, so be prepared to work out in advance who will see what (and follow the advice in the next step too).
The festival map is available online a few days before the event. Be aware that the line-up is always subject to change, so have back-up choices in case.

Decide how you want to deliver your message.,
Decide if you want to send your message to the band as a whole or just one member.,
Make your message unique.,
Make sure to spell and grammar check.,
Do you want to include something if you're sending a package or a letter?,
If you're writing a letter, include a self addressed and stamped envelope so if the boys want to leave a reply, they know where to send one.

",How to Get One Direction to Read your Fan Mail and Reply," There are many methods such as a Facebook message through their page, a Tweet, or a letter.;
, That way, you can focus on what you really want to write. Maybe even send a message to every guy!

, There are millions of Directioners in the world, and hundreds of thousands probably send tweets and letters, all saying ""I love you! Please come to -insert place name-!"" Messages of encouragement or support are all great, but you might have a story. Depending on whether you are composing a Tweet or sending a letter, your message length is obviously going to be longer. Examples are a funny joke or a witty one liner for a Tweet. For a letter, consider sending a story. Maybe the boys helped you follow your musical dream or a certain song helped you get through a tough time. Tell them!

, The boys aren't probably going to spend their time reading incoherent ramblings like ""OMG I totally love you Nial!!1! R u coming 2 Vancouver????"" That just makes you seem like you haven't spent any effort on your message or that you're just a hyperactive Fangirl who'll move onto the next hot band when they come around. A better message might be ""I love you Niall! I especially love you as a brunette. Are you coming to Vancouver, Canada in your 2013 tour?""

, If you're thinking of a present, don't send them anything too extravagant or expensive. They are capable of buying themselves things and don't want their fans to spend loads of money on them. If you do want to send something, make it small, cheap, and preferably something humorous. Are you an artist? What about sending some fan art? If you've got a great picture of the guys, send one along too.

Add something blue around your neck. A blue scarf or necklace is a subtle way to add something blue to your outfit.
Wear a blue brooch. A brooch on your suit or dress can add a touch of blue as you walk down the aisle.

However, if you're going for something a bit over-the-top for your wedding, blue eye shadow may actually help.
The bride can also wear blue makeup on her big day. Think about adding a touch of blue eyeshadow yourself, if it doesn't clash too much with the rest of your outfit.

The Black Market (2014)

;
, The next step is to buy their albums. If you go to a CD shop like HMV, you can usually pick up 2 CD's for £10. It can be quite expensive so you might want to buy two every month for a couple of months. Their newer albums are not as heavy as the first three so if you're into more hardcore stuff, get the older albums first. If you're not so hardcore, get their newer albums first. Always buy their albums - Don't download them illegally. If you're not sure if you'll like their music, listen to it on YouTube first.

, Nothing says ""I'm a Rise Against fan"" like having all of their albums. However, nothing says ""I'm a hardcore Rise Against fan"" like a Rise Against t-shirt. You can pick up some cheap clothes on websites like Amazon and Ebay, just make sure it's what you really want before you buy it; you may not be able to get a refund. Shop around too, you can find some seriously cheap shirts if you look around.

, To really appreciate their music, go see them live. You may have to wait a while for them to come to your area if you live outside of the US. However, if you do live in the US, they're pretty much always touring. Go see them play live if you think you're ready. Be warned though, know your stuff before you go. The people there are most likely to be hardcore fans and will know everything about the band. From their song lyrics to what equipment they use. If you do happen to get into a conversation with one of these fans, don't try to act like you've been a fan for very long. Tell them you've just heard of them and you really like them. They'll teach you some stuff about them rather than make you look stupid.

, Everyone in the band (apart from Brandon; the drummer) are straight-edge. This means that they do not smoke, they do not drink and they're also vegans. While you don't have to do all of that, it just shows how passionate the band are about helping the world. If you're passionate about the band's music, you should do the same. A good start will be to become a vegetarian. If you've heard their song ""Ready To Fall"", you'll know that the band are against killing animals. You could also become straight-edge if you want to. Note that you shouldn't let the band's views change your own - if you want to eat meat, go ahead. You should only do what the band are doing if you really want to, not to fit in.

, Rise Against didn't get famous through advertising, they got famous through word of mouth. If every one of their fans thought talking about them was a bad idea, they wouldn't be where they are now. Tell your friends that you've found this new band and ask them to listen to them. If they don't like them, it's their choice. If they do like them, you've given Rise Against another fan, what a great fan you are! Don't talk about them too much though, it can get annoying. Also, don't talk about them like you're an expert, the person you're talking to could be an expert themselves. If you're certain that the person knows nothing of Rise Against, go ahead and show off a tiny bit. Make sure the person knows that you're joking though, not making them look stupid.

You could buy merchandise, you could send them nice tweets on Twitter, and everything in between. You could also follow One Direction fan accounts on Instagram and the such (eg. @StoleMyGirl), or set up a fan account yourself! Do whatever makes you feel comfortable, but no one will force you to prove to the entire world that you are a Directioner.;
,, Their names are: Niall James Horan, Hazza, Wolverhampton, Payno.

,, Don't feel bad if you don't have all of their albums. Don't worry. Go to YouTube and type ""One Direction Full Album"" and enjoy the good music, all the albums are there. Also, a little secret is that most Directioners don't like every song, even though we don't say it. We have favorites and those that we sometimes skip on shuffle. Maybe you just aren't in the mood of the song. If you don't like a song, just keep it to yourself!


Listen to a couple of their songs to get started. Two famous ones are ""What Makes You Beautiful"" and ""Midnight Memories"".







, If you didn't know, One Direction were formed on the UK version of X-Factor, Season 7 in 2010. All of their performances, including the separate boy's auditions and the moments they were formed, are on YouTube. It's also recommended that you watch their video diaries, as well. It's mostly the boys being themselves, and that is where the phrases No, Jimmy Protested and I like girls who eat carrots are from, as well as many others. Some Directioners like to constantly say these inside jokes, which is perfectly fine. That's kind of the point anyway. Just because they were made four years ago, does not mean they are old. Still in the fandom they are referred to as ""carrot jokes"" since they have been used so many times. You should know when it's a good time to make a carrot joke.

, We love them all equally and don't exactly have a favorite. You may fancy one more or have that special place in your heart for one of them, but you do not have a favorite. Choosing a favorite member is like choosing a favorite child. Don't only like one or two and not care about the rest. That's just not how we roll. Though we do categorize each other by saying like ""Oh, I am a Harry Girl, I am a Niall Girl, I am a Liam Girl, I am a Zayn Girl or I am a Louis Girl!"". That isn't exactly a favorite, it's just that boy who took the special spot for you.

, If you do this, you will be labeled a 'carrot' by the rest of the fandom. A good place to find a lot of the jokes used by other directioners is their video diaries and video tour diaries. Here you will find 'no jimmy protested' and ' I like girls who eat carrots' as well as many others.

, Many people do not like One Direction, but they enjoy making fun of them and Directioners. We live by a quote, ""You can make fun of us fans, but do not make fun of our boys."" In return the boys have said ""You can make fun of us but do not make fun of our girls (Directioners.)"" That's love right there. Ignore those who insult One Direction. Do not give them any attention as that is what they want. They may or may not know that you like 1D. You may stand up for the boys but remember, Harry once said ""Work hard, play hard, be kind."" So go by that. If you stand up for One Direction then fight for it but be extremely kind. Flatten them with kindness. Some people don't like One Direction, but they might know you like them, and they are very respectful about it. (i.e. If a One Direction song comes on, they cringe and maybe say a remark, but keeps to themselves.) Shower these people with flowers (not literally) for being respectful, do not complain about the cringe or remark.

, We Directioners are all family. Many times, some Directioners turn on each other and cyberbully those for silly reasons. So, if you want to be a Directioner, the biggest and greatest thing you could do is to respect other Directioners and their opinions. If a Directioner confronts you rudely (which, should be rare, but it happens.), calmly tell them to leave you alone. Sometimes you can also make a conversation out of it. See their side of the story. But don't be rude!


The One Direction fandom can be very mature and very dark at times. Those that are the age of 10 or younger, of course you are welcome to join the fandom since all of us are family but be warned and watch out of the doings of your older Directioners.







, And they respect you for your love and your support.

Their names are Bill Kaulitz, Tom Kaulitz, Gustav Schäfer and George Listing. Bill and Tom are identical twin brothers. Bill is the youngest of the band and Georg is the oldest. Go research them, at www.TokioHotelamerica.com or www.TokioHotel.com.;
, (Eg. Gustav has been playing the drums since the age of 5!) or how before they were Tokio Hotel they were known as Devilish. Devilish has some pretty good songs too, Try ""It's so hard to live"".

, Set them as your background on your computer, phone, whatever. Print some out and tape them up on your walls. (This is obviously optional)

, Try to know all the lyrics to all their songs. Don't just listen to their English songs, listen to German ones, too. Make sure you really like Tokio Hotel before you buy their CD.

, Buying their music is a huge part of being a dedicated fan.

, Singing along (NOT screaming) is always fun at concerts. Learn their lyrics even the German one (Take in mind that without proper German lessons from a professional you will have an accent.)

, Most people haven't heard of Tokio Hotel in the USA. Be proud to be a fan and share their great music with other people.

, Unfortunately their official European merchandise site doesn't ship to the U.S. Try their American merchandise site (Go to their official website, scroll down and click Merchandise) They have about 3 shirts,a button set, key chain,poster and their CD for affordable prices.You can also go to Hottopic.com , They have the Bill Kaulitz baby doll tee and 2 Hot topic exclusive Tokio Hotel shirts. They go for about $20-$25 U.S dollars.

, Concerts give you the full experience of listening to music and being around other fans too.

Their CD's are priced from $10-$20, Schrei! so laut du kannst being the rarest and most expensive. You can buy Scream in the US for about $10.00.

, They are really important too, Listen to the drum intro in Wo sind eure Hände/Raise your hands or the Bass ""solo"" in the intro of Beichte. They are also incredibly talented, but for some reason fans seem to like Bill and Tom more ( Maybe it's because they're gorgeous and they have good personalities ) Georg and Gustav are the same they just tend to hide from the limelight.Remember Tokio Hotel without Georg and Gustav wouldn't be Tokio Hotel, It would just be Bill & Tom Kaulitz.

, Gerard, Frank, and Mikey are in new bands now, and Ray is working on a solo album currently. Give their new stuff a try.


Hesitant Alien - Gerard Way
Stomachaches - frnkiero and the celebration

, It's sad that they broke up, but don't be angry and refuse to listen to their solo music, instead support them and their new careers.

Research the band.,
Know the music.,
Learn the facts.,
Join the Enter Shikari Forum.,
See the live shows.,
Buy the merchandise.,
Meet the band.,
Develop your obsession.,
Become a Lion.",How to Be an Enter Shikari Fan," It's important to know the four band members: Roughton 'Rou' Reynolds - vocals/electronics, Chris Batten - bass, Rory Clewlow - guitar, and Rob Rolfe - drums. Learn the band's history: how did they start out? How did they get their name? Where are they from? Do your homework. Use their official website and Myspace. Get as much information on them as possible.;
, It's impossible to be a true Enter Shikari fan without knowing their music and knowing it well. Listen to as much of their music as you can - not just the well known songs like Sorry You're Not A Winner and Jonny Sniper. Download their entire back catalogue. Rou has stated that he doesn't mind fans file-sharing songs if they're tracks that aren't available to buy anymore. B-sides, demo tracks, and remixes are all compulsory listening for a true Shikari fan. Aim to know their music so well that you can sing every song off by heart.

, Knowing the nitty-gritty about the band guarantees you credibility and respect from other fans. Always remember that 'We Can Breathe In Space, They Just Don't Want Us To Escape' is actually one of the band's old demo songs, but was re-recorded in 2008 and released as a single. Shikari were the second ever unsigned band to sell out the London Astoria. Rob, Rou and Chris were in a band called 'Hybryd' before being joined by Rory. And please, please, pronounce the members' names right: referring to Rou as 'Roo' is a running joke in the Enter Shikari fanbase and will get you laughed at.

, Being a member of the Forum has many advantages. It gives you the opportunity to talk with other fans and ask questions about things you aren't sure of; the band are all members, so you have a chance of talking to them; and the members of the forum are known to the band, even getting a mention in the Take To The Skies album notes. Sign up, and get to know the 'regulars': these tend to have a high post count, and are worth getting friendly with, as they all often attend shows together and many of them are personally known to the band. Pay particular attention to 'Ambush Reality', also known as Ian, as he is the band's manager. Most of the ""Dedicated"" ESF crew now post on their own forum, which anyone can join. It was set up by 3 guys called kappa99, malky and kit. Its called The Zone and is a really friendly place.

, Enter Shikari are well known for their amazingly energetic and riotous gigs. It's a necessity to see them at least once, and the majority of fans go to as many as they possibly can - some more than 10 dates in a tour - leading to why they have such a tight-knit fanbase. Check their Myspace and Forum often for upcoming shows and tours. It's worth following the band around, as this how you become a well known face to the band.

, Many fans collect Enter Shikari memorabilia to show their appreciation for the band. If you're not into collecting, this isn't necessary. A couple of T-shirts and a hoodie are the essentials. You can buy these at shows or online. The band's singles and album are also compulsory for every fan. If you would like to go a step further and show your love for the band through your collection of merchandise, like many fans, there are many things you can buy. A lot of the band's discography is released in different formats, such as CD, vinyl or special edition. Try to get hold of every format. Ebay is a good way of doing this. Ebay can also be used to find rare Enter Shikari items such as old EP's (the Nodding Acquaintance EP being the rarest), limited edition promos, and old tour shirts that are no longer sold. There are a number of T-shirts and hoodies available, as well as other forms of merchandise such as keychains and posters. Become familiar with the more unique items such as the Enter Shikari fingerlights and the Jonny Sniper condoms.

, Enter Shikari are known for having a close relationship with their fans. It won't be hard to meet them if you're dedicated enough. The band often come out before and after shows to meet fans, so either get there early or wait around outside the venue after a show. If you get to meet them, remember to tell them who you are (this can help them to recognise and remember you if you meet them again). They are always very friendly and happy to meet their fans, so don't be shy about talking to them. If possible, ask them to sign a CD/picture, or get your photo taken with them.

, Show off your obsession with the band in ways that are unique to you. Use your talents - if you are good at art, try drawing the band or designing Shikari-related artwork - you could even send it to them! If you like music, learn to cover their songs, or make your own remixes. Enjoy writing? Try writing reviews, fanfiction, or even making your own fanpage. Put posters up in your room. 'Enter Shikari walls' are popular with fans, particularly those on the Forum - decorating a wall in your house or bedroom with anything related to Shikari: drawings, magazine articles, posters, ticket stubs, stickers, anything! Buy magazines that feature the band to keep up with the latest news and interviews. Watch the videos on their Youtube channel - these will help you to understand inside jokes popular with fans, such as 'Eggstick'. Keep up with the latest events, such as single releases, new music videos, upcoming shows etc. Show your appreciation for the band in any way you want.

, Enter Shikari's new website has a specific section reserved for people who register as Lions. Becoming a Lion gives you special access to forums, videos, pictures and special behind the scenes stuff. You may even get an early crack at discounts and stuff from their merchandise store. Plus, you get to meet other fans.

Show respect to other Maggots.",How to Be a Maggot,";
, Show the world your musical affiliation.


Dress like a metalhead, but don't be excessive with studs. wristbands and belts are okay. Avoid spikes.
If you wear spikes into a mosh pit, chances are you'll stab somebody. Slipknot shirts and accessories are available on the Internet and most punk inspired stores such as Hot Topic.
There's no such thing as a poser. If you like the music, you like the music. If you don't, you don't.







, Incorporate them. You're a Maggot, so bring Maggot to school. But don't let your grades fail because of your taste in music. Do good in school.

, Understand that hardcore metalheads will call Slipknot 'fake' metal. Be better than them and listen to all music (yes, even Electric Six).

,, Don't just choose Paul because you both play bass, Or Mick just because you think he has the most badass mask.

, Drums and guitar are the most popular, but that doesn't mean that they're right for you.

, What a better way to become a Maggot?

,, There are masks for sale on the Internet for around 35 dollars. You could also be creative and buy a Halloween mask and make it to match your personality.


For example, Jim wanted a Jester mask to symbolize that part of himself, but also to remain scary.

, Unless it's a police officer or person of authority, in that case you should do everything they tell you to do.

, Be open and easy to get along with or people will avoid you. There are people who don't tolerate difference. Don't always be a tough guy.

, If you see another maggot walking down the street, give him or her a nod. Maggots are a cult-like following of the band. Treat all Maggots as your friend.

, Disturb the peace and cause old people to roll their eyes. Remember, don't get discouraged by the thought of Slipknot dying. Even if they break up, their spirit will always remain.

, Read their biographies. Explore websites. Know your band. Collect all the music. Try to find rare videos, hidden tracks, unreleased songs, and other mysterious things.

, We are one big family!

Learn the history.,
.",How to Be A Good Evanescence Fan," One of the common hurdles in being a fan is when you are unable to pronounce or spell the name. Evanescence is pronounced ""Ev·eh·NES·ence"". The spelling can be tricky, but is easy to get used to after a while. Just remember the first part, Evan, and then ad on essence, like two separate words. The word means to fade or disappear; something fleeting, only there for a moment. The lead singer of the band, Amy Lee, says they chose the name because it was ""Beautiful and creates an image in the listener's mind"".;
, The face of the band is vocalist Amy Lee, who is also the pianist and main song writer. Jen Majura and Troy MacLawhorn are the guitarists of the band. Will hunt is the drummer and Tim McCord is the bassist of the band.

, Past members include: David Hodges- He was 2nd vocalist and did most of the piano work on the group's smash CD ""Fallen."" He left because he wanted to make Evanescence more of a Christian band, and Amy and Ben didn't want that. Ben Moody was the band's original lead guitarist, then he quit. There are many theories as to why Ben left, but the only people who know what really happened are those who were there. The solid facts are quoted from some interviews with Amy: basically Amy said that Ben had many personal issues, was putting a lot of tension within the band and could be very controlling. Then in 2011 Ben wrote an open letter to fans about his departure of the band citing that he acknowledged his behavior toward Amy and there were times he tried desperately to kick her out of the band and replace her. He had apologized for his actions and had reached out to Amy but it was to no avail. On a lighter note he did make a review video on the self titled Evanescence album and said ""I love it, it's much better than 'The Open Door'. Or whatever it was called"". William Boyd was the bassist, but left when they were about to start The Open Door tour; he didn't want to go on tour again, preferring to stay home to be with his family. John LeCompt was the 2nd guitarist, but Amy fired him because she felt that he and Rocky wanted to leave Evanescence, and were just staying in it for the money. Rocky Gray was the band's drummer from the beginning, but decided to leave in January over unknown reasons. (NOT because of Amy firing John, as many people believe. Rocky decided to leave Evanescence months before this.) Current members are Terry Balsamo the lead guitarist (joined after Fallen was recorded and Ben Moody left, but before The Open Door), Tim McCord the bassist (joined in 2006), Troy McLawhorn the rhythm guitarist (joined in 2011), and Will Hunt the drummer (joined in 2010).

, Listen to the songs. The Evanescence albums are quite easy to find in good music stores. Don't illegally download the music off the internet: actually buy the albums so you properly own them. Plus if you buy all the CD's you can get bonus tracks and video features. The three studio albums: Fallen (2003), The Open Door (2006), and the most recent - their self titled album released. There's also the live album Anywhere But Home (2004), as well as several EP's from earlier years, and the full length demo CD, Origin (2000) in 2011 There are several sites on the internet which let you download the EP's for free, such as The Evanescence Reference. Notice the change from the EP's all the way to Evanescence (2011) - from gothic rock right through to a massive change in music and lyrics. In order, it would be:


Evanescence EP (1998)
Sound Asleep EP (1999)
Origin (2000)
Mystery EP (2002)
Fallen (2003)
Anywhere But Home (2004)
The Open Door (2006)
Evanescence (2011)

",How to Be a Black Veil Brides Fan," You obviously have to enjoy their music. The band plays typically hard rock and glam metal. A song that will show their typical sound would be Rebel Love Song. Other songs you should check out include Fallen Angels, Ritual, In the End, Smokes & Mirrors, Hello My Hate, Sex & Hollywood, Nobody's Hero and The Legacy.;
, Many fans don't know who the band really are supposed to be. In fact, they don't notice the rock bands the band lights in their music. Some fans tend to just like the band because they saved their life or because they think Andy Biersack is cute. The band are pretty much bringing back the older sound of rock n' roll from around the 1980s. They slowly sound more old-school from album to album. Their debut album was more of melodic metalcore than glam metal or hard rock. Although it does have a lot of glam influences. The band carry the hard rock style of KISS and the glam metal vein of Mötley Crüe. The band's appearance is the stereotypical rockstar image. They look and sound as if Mötley Crüe or KISS had kids who became rock musicians. They have big, black, smeared makeup (although recently they haven't worn makeup), tattoos, black leather, tight clothes, studs and they even have long hair and they also stick out their tongues and do the matoik. The band abandoned the melodic metalcore style of their debut and moved to hard rock and glam metal with the second album, Set the World on Fire. At that time, that's when the band began to look like KISS, Mötley Crüe and Alice Cooper. The band have been praised by plenty of rock legends now such as Zakk Wylde, Gene Simmons, Alice Cooper and Dee Snider. Even the band has toured with Mötley Crüe and are friends with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe.

, The members are Andy Biersack (vocals), Christian ""CC"" Coma (drums), Jinxx (guitar), Jake Pitts (guitar) and Ashley Purdy (bass).

, You'll definitely find it at any music store as well as Target, Walmart and iTunes and Hot Topic

, Despite many fans listen to Asking Alexandria, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Escape the Fate, I See Stars, As I Lay Dying, Pierce the Veil, Blood on the Dance Floor, Sleeping With Sirens, Of Mice & Men, etc, those bands are nothing similar to the style of Black Veil Brides. Try the following artists/bands who are most likely similar or might be doing what Black Veil Brides is doing: KISS, Mötley Crüe, LA Guns, Blessed By a Broken Heart, Sixx AM, Alice Cooper, Guns N Roses, Scorpions, Toxicrose, Avenged Sevenfold, Murderdolls, etc.

Find out which record label the band or singer is on.,
Go to as many concerts as you can, and if possible, arrive early or stay late or both.,
Try talking to the roadies (usually big guys carrying equipment around), band security staff or others who seem to be associated with the band.,
Check out band forums and find out where the band hangs out in particular towns, what hotels they stay in, and where they've been seen hanging out.,
See if a fan club or fan site offers VIP packages for concerts and fundraisers.,
Get involved in writing reviews of concerts and records, perhaps for a website or local newspaper.,
Be polite.,
Check with local musical instrument stores for musician clinics.,
Use Social Networks (like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.etc.),
Enter contests to meet your band or musician.",How to Meet Your Favourite Band or Singer," Many record labels have promotional teams known as Street Teams. If you join one of these and help out with things like handing out fliers before concerts, they may give you a backstage pass or invite you to promotional parties in your area.


Go to the label website to look for Street Teams opportunities and sign up.;
, Sometimes you will see the musicians going in and out of the venue and will be able to get to know them like that. Sometimes bands will stick around after the show and hang out with fans.


Smaller bands will often recognize fans who have turned up regularly. Try to wear something that makes you stand out, and wear that every time, so you're easily recognizable.But try not to stand out too much!
Many large arenas use Street Teams to help promote productions and shows locally. If they usually play your arena this is another great way to get on a list.

, If you are friendly and enthusiastic (but not crazy), they may be able to get you in.

,


Consider booking a hotel room where the band often stays. Some bands are loyal to certain hotels in certain towns and their behavior is predictable. Check out the bar area in the hotel after the show or the pool area the day of if it's a nice place.
If you know which bars or clubs the band visit before or after their shows, go there and try to get into the VIP areas. People who seem fun (and sane) are more likely to get in to the popular band hang-outs and be invited into the VIP areas. You may need to buy access into a VIP area.

Be friendly and send over a round of drinks/shots if you're in a bar. Ask the wait staff or band what they are drinking before you do. They often appreciate the gesture and will chat with you and offer a photo opportunity.



, These often include tickets to a show, invitation to a meet and greet, priority seating and sometimes a gift or autographed piece of memorabilia.


These may cost more but often when you pay for such privileges you will have the opportunity to meet the band and they offer package buyers some one on one conversation during a group meet and greet with other package buyers.
They are more likely to speak to you at these than just encountering them while they are out with friends.

, This should enable you to get on the guest list, or better still, a press pass which allows you more access to the band.

,


Never attempt to invade their personal space without permission.
Ask before you hug, take a picture or interrupt a personal moment.
If they're with friends or family you should acknowledge them, be friendly and perhaps excuse the intrusion if they are being open to your interruption.
Never cry, hyperventilate or be anything other than a friendly person.
Never confuse ""meeting"" someone with aggressively approaching them, running after them, screaming at them, jumping them or grabbing them. A meeting is a civil introduction and sometimes will lead to a conversation.

,


Some larger music stores (like Guitar Center) will periodically have instructional clinics. There is usually a lot of interaction with the people that attend the clinics and the crowd sizes are usually limited.

, And that may help you of some sort.

, It makes you more eligible to meet them.

Start by just listening to their music.,
Learn about the people.,
Try to find the meanings in their songs.,
Purchase some band merchandise.,
Keep an eye out for concerts.,
Don't become too obsessive.",How to Appreciate Slayer," Slayer has twelve studio albums. Begin purchasing their albums and downloading them to your portable music player. Learn the rhythms and lyrics. If you play drums, bass, or guitar, try learning some of the songs on your instrument.;
, You don't need to know Tom Araya, Jeff Hannerman, Kerry King, and Dave Lombardo's life story, but it's good to at least know their positions and about major things that happen in their life and general information. Learn about the past members, and why they left the band.

, It's always fun to try to decode songs. Google the meaning and see what other people are thinking it means; you might realize that one of their ideas suits the song better than your original idea.

, Don't go too overboard; it's okay to have a few tees and a jacket, but don't stuff your wardrobe with their merchandise. If you want all their CDs, then that's a different matter; you aren't wearing their CDs, so you can own as many of them as you'd like. Try ordering anything of theirs straight from the band's website's online store; that way you don't give up most of your money to the corporate store selling the shirts.

, If there's ever a concert of theirs in your area, make sure to try to go. Bring some friends who like the same music as you do so you can have twice as fun. Take pictures and post them to social networking sites.

, Listen to other bands too. It's great to have varied tastes in music and knowledge about musicians; learn about some of your other favorite bands too. Don't be afraid to state that you like other artists of different genres too; if you enjoy listening to VNV Nation, don't hide it. There is no one telling you that you can't listen to different kinds of genres.

Wear a Justin T-Shirt. You could announce you’re a True Belieber on the shirt itself!Or just wear T-shirts a lot because Justin does.
Justin’s T-shirts are usually in neutral colors, like gray, white, or beige. One of his favorite looks is to wear a T-shirt underneath a plaid or other buttoned-down shirt. A big exception to the neutrals: Purple. Mix some purple into your outfit as it is his favorite color.
Justin’s T-shirts have gotten so long that they’ve almost resembled tunics that reach his knees.;
, Justin is a big fan of sports team clothes. So, if you want to look like him, you’ll have to wear some jerseys, especially for professional basketball teams.


He sometimes lays it on thick, wearing a baseball cap along with a short-sleeved basketball team jersey.
Justin doesn’t stick with one team. He’s been seeing wearing Toronto Raptors Classics Purple Swingman shorts. He’s worn a Charlotte Hornets teal jersey and a Denver Nuggets Navy blue jersey, and many others.
He sometimes wears T-shirts with team names or sports brands, like Nike, on them. You could also wear camouflage. Whether it’s a camo T-shirt or camo shorts, Justin is a fan of the pattern.

, Justin likes short sleeved button-down plaid shirts or plaid shirts without any sleeves at all. It’s one of his most common looks. You’ll look like a true fan in one.


To look like a True Belieber, make sure you wear a solid colored T-shirt underneath the plaid shirt. That’s his signature look.
Justin’s stylist has described him as being “really a skater boy, that’s really what he looks like” and says they try to reference ‘70s and ‘80s skater culture.To look like Justin, you can try out the flannel shirt look but in black-and white-colors, not just the typical red-and-white.

, Justin wears hoodies a lot. His entire vibe is pretty casual and loose, as if he’s not taking things too seriously.


Justin especially likes hoodies that come with extra-long drawstrings. Justin is not a fan of the super tight look.
Justin changes up his hoodies by wearing sleeveless ones sometimes. Try olive green Army colors.
If you want to be a True Belieber, dressing like he does is a way to show your respect and admiration.

, Justin likes this look. Think baggy gray shorts as one possibility. The shorts shouldn’t be too, well, short.Wear shorts that fall just above the knees if you want to look more like a True Belieber. That’s how Justin does it.
Basketball team shorts are a favorite. For example, Justin has worn Los Angeles Clippers baggy basketball shorts.
Justin also has been photographed in baggy red shorts that sometimes fall slightly down, revealing a glimpse of his Calvin Klein underwear!

, Going along with Justin’s casual vibe, he’s often seen in jeans. If you want to be a True Belieber, you should do the same.


Justin wears low-waisted skinny jeans in destroyed denim. Look for stone-washed jeans with rips in them.
He likes black jeans a lot. Try Saint Laurent Original Low Waisted Destroyed Skinny Jean in black.
Justin doesn’t wear high-waisted jeans, and he doesn’t wear baggy jeans as much as he wears baggy shorts.

, Although Justin rocks a casual look, there are times that he’s out on the town and has to dress up.


For dress up, Justin is usually in tight-fitting skinny suits. He sometimes tries them in interesting colors, like dark purple or pairs them with colorful or unusual jackets.
When he wears a tie, it’s usually a skinny black one. He’s not a fan of pattered ties.
Wear a simple white buttoned-down shirt under the suit to look like a True Belieber.

, Justin wears tennis shoes a lot, especially high tops in brand names. So you’ll have to ditch the fancy footwear.


Try Nike Air Command Force shoes in black/pink pow/white. Or try wearing a pair of red trainers.Justin often wears high tops, but not always. He’s also been seen in ankle strap sneakers. Leather sneakers are one of his favorite looks, but he’s also sometimes seen in canvas shoes.
Justin’s footwear stands out. He makes statements with his shoes. He’s not afraid to set trends and try something new. Avoid Uggs! Justin hates Ugg boots on girls, so wear tennis shoes instead.

, To look like a true Belieber, you should be a fan of leather. Justin is often seen in leather clothing.


He’s worn an Acme leather Biker jacket and leather pants. The leather jacket is a common item he wears, so you’ll capture his vibe if you wear one too.
Leather tennis shoes are among his favorite. He wears leather in many articles of clothing.
You can often find leather jackets and pants that look like his designer duds for cheaper prices, though. Try stores like H&M.

, Justin is a fan of hats. Wear a black hat. Or wear a beanie. Justin is a fan of beanies.


He’s been seen pairing a red beanie with a gray sweatshirt and baggie white pants with tears in them, along with Nike high tops.
When he wears fancier hats, with a brim, as he sometimes does, they're usually black.
Wear a button that says something cute, like ""Mrs. Bieber,"" ""I have Bieber Fever,"" ""Justin is mine,"" and so on. To make it, just print the right sized picture for a plain button you have and glue it on.

, Justin likes to put clothes on top of other clothes. For example, he will wear a buttoned-down shirt over a T-shirt.


Justin was once quoted as saying he’s “really into, like, drapy things, drapy sweaters, layering pieces.”This layering principle goes with his headgear too. For example, he’s often spotted wearing baseball caps until sweatshirt hoodies. He will wear a T-shirt over another T-shirt. He will tie a shirt around his waist.
You might also see Justin wear a tunic length T-shirt under a hoodie. As a True Belieber, you want to show you appreciate his style by emulating it.

, If you want to look like a True Belieber, you’ll need some tattoos. His tattoos are well-known, and he’s not shy about showing them off.


Justin has a tattoo of a cross in the center of his chest. But that’s just for starters! He’s got a lot of tattoos, so a lot of True Beliebers do too.
What sets Justin’s look apart are the tattoos on both of his arms. He’s got tattoos covering his left arm from shoulder to wrist, and tattoos on his right arm from his wrist to his elbow.
Some of Justin’s lesser known tattoos are very small. For example, he has a tattoo of a bird on his lower abdomen.

, Justin is into the baggy look, whether it’s pants or shorts, and you can often see a little glimpse of his underwear peeking out.


He often wears white underwear with the brand name Calvin Klein across the waistband. Justin has also worn Calvin Klein’s low rise cotton trunk in red flair.
Be lean. Justin is in great shape. He’s muscular, and his abs are defined. He doesn’t have much body fat, which is one reason his waistbands sometimes fall down.

, Justin has a very signature look. His hair is emulated and copied by many fans.


Go light on the makeup. Don’t cake it on. You won’t look like Justin then. As for the hair, decide whether you want to go early Justin (with heavy bangs) or later Justin (with longer bangs but pushed back off his forehead).
Paint your nails a color from his line, One Less Lonely Glitter or write something cute, such as the initials JB or some hearts with a nail art pen.
Keep your hair short on the sides– and brown or highlighted. He’s worn his hair bleached blonde, but that is not his signature look. You won’t see Justin with long hair, and you won’t look like his fan with it, either.

, Wear jewelry. Whether it’s necklaces or bracelets, you will usually see Justin wearing some kind of jewelry. Justin also likes small round sunglasses.


Go heavy on the necklaces. Justin likes long necklaces. He might wear two at once, such as a dog tag and a cross. He’s been spotted in a silver link necklace. Generally he favors longer necklaces.
Justin has worn a black What Would Jesus Do bracelet.
Another accessory that Justin sometimes wears is metallic gloves. He's more likely to wear these while performing, though.He likes paisley bandannas too."

Decide which Avril look you're going for.,
Whichever look you're going for, get long hair.,
Dye your hair.,
Be unique.",How to Do Your Hair to Resemble Avril Lavigne's Hair," Do you want her dirty blonde and black look, or her platinum blonde look?;
, Avril is always seen with long hair. If you have long hair, keep it a few inches above your waist, with very few layers at the bottom of your hair. If you have short hair, grow it out long.

, If you're going for the black and dirty blonde look, separate your hair into two parts; top and bottom. Dye the bottom part black and the top part almost a dirty blonde. For the platinum blonde look, dye your whole head platinum blonde, except for the front where you can put pink and green in it. If you wanted to be a little different, instead of dying it pink and green, dye the hair your two favorite colors.

, Don't copy Avril's hair to a tee, make it your own. If your want to get some funky layers, or different highlights, do by all means.

Don't judge him when he changes his style.",How to Become a True Bill Kaulitz Fan," Well, everyone knows that Bill hates fans dressing like him- so to prove you're a real fan of his, don't! It's a very simple rule. But sometimes you like some styles that could be the same as him not because you're trying to copy him. That's fine (e.g. Criss Angel, Adam Lambert and Andy Sixx, Black Veil Brides);
, Do not believe anyone you see on any of the above sites (or any you can think of) claiming to be Bill (or any of the other members).

It represents his freedom, and how is now free to do all of things he couldn't do before, due to laws. He has also gotten a tattoo up his left side saying ""Wir werden nie aufhören zu schreien. Wir zurück zu den Wurzeln."" In English it means ""We will never stop screaming. We are going back to the roots/origins."" His newest tattoos are both on his hand. One tattoo says ""0630"". It's a twin tattoo, and it matches Tom's tattoo. It represents the time of his birth, 06:30. His other hand tattoo covers his entire hand, as a skeleton hand.

Be part of a power couple.,
Come up with a fierce alter ego.",How to Be Like Beyonce1," If there's one thing that stands out above the talent, dedication, and all-around presence that is Queen Bey, it's got to be the supreme confidence that she radiates at all times, in all things she does. Whether you're just running out for groceries or you're performing on stage, you should command the presence of everyone in the room with your confidence and ease at being yourself.


Try positive affirmations, if you're not as confident as you'd like to be. Try Beyonce lyrics, to make this extra-Beyonce-like: Chant ""I'm a survivor"" to yourself when you're feeling less confident than you want. Chant till you believe it.
Accept your shortcomings and your challenges. If you're aware of your weak spots, you can have power over them. They're a part of you.;
, Beyonce, the daughter of a Texas hairdresser and a Xerox sales manager, didn't just wander into her successes accidentally. It takes work. She set huge standards for herself, and became who she is on the back of hard work and dedication to her talent. Aim as high as possible, and figure out what you need to do to actually make those goals a reality.


Start young. Beyonce met the other girls in Destiny's Child when she was young girls, and their goals were established and firm from a young age. They wanted to be stars. What's your big ambition?
Try not to focus on other people's advantages, constantly comparing yourself to those who are already successful and had an easier road to that success. Just focus on what you need to do to meet your goals.

, Figure out a way to be creative in whatever talent field you're involved with. Put your own spin on the work you have to do, and make your work as unique as the person making it.


Try to develop your creative hobbies, if you have any talent for creative pursuits. You don't have to be a singer or a dancer, like Beyonce, but they're certainly worthy creative pursuits for a fan.
Everyone's good at something, and it might take a while to find out what that something is, but don't give up on yourself. Just because you're not a brain surgeon or an astronaut or a Hollywood actress does not mean you don't have a purpose, or that you aren't creative. Find what inspires you and see where it leads.

, Beyonce wouldn't be content to just do the bare minimum. Whatever you do, creative work or not, you need to go above and beyond, doing your absolute best, and achieving at the highest level, even if you're not feeling it today.


This might sound corny, but if you're struggling to care abut a particular project at school, or some assignment you've been given at work, Try to think about it like Beyonce would. How would she go about this project? What would she say to her boss?

, Beyonce hangs a Grammy in her gym, to keep herself focused and motivated on the goal at hand. It's not enough to set ambitious goals–you've also got to keep yourself fixated and working toward those goals at all times. You've got to put in the hours.

, Beyonce is not only a great singer and dancer, but a talented fashion designer, perfumer, shoe designer, actress, activist, and she has a hand in many other fields. She's a jack-of-all trades, and strives to achieve at a high level, even in fields she's inexperienced with.


Don't let yourself stagnate. Keep adding new talents and skills to your bag of tricks. Be restless. Do what's necessary to learn to do what you want to be able to do.

, Beyonce is a philanthropist, generous with her time and money, using her influence to help others. Knowles became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song ""I Was Here"" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign. It might sound impossible if you aren't a huge name in Hollywood, but take little steps to helping your friends and neighbors.


People do kind things for each other every day, and it can be as simple as giving someone a smile, holding a door open, donating some money, or tons of other things. Be giving with your time.

, Beyonce and Jay-Z are equally well-respected in the world of pop music, as innovators and powerful talents. If you want to be like Beyonce, look for someone that you will respect and admire as an equal, then conquer the world together. Individually, they're in control of their own lives, ambitious, and successful. Together, they're unstoppable.


You don't have to be rich or powerful to be part of a ""power"" couple. Power couples are forged on mutual respect, mutual ambition, and independence. Power couples are formed when two successful but like-minded people come together and form a bond.

, Sasha Fierce is a more energetic stage persona of Beyonce. Beyonce, you might say, ""becomes"" Sasha Fierce when she's on stage, which might help give her the courage to do things like dance on stage with flaming pyro while wearing a glow-in-the-dark bra and leopard print pants.


Try tapping into a ""fierce"" side of yourself can give you the confidence to do things you might not normally do, and maintain the confidence of the person you want to be. Simply pretend to be someone else.
Center yourself in that alter ego when you need a confidence boost. Need to gear up for a big work presentation? Get your fierce face on.

Develop your own personal style.,
Get physical.,
Eat healthy.,
Be real.,
Highlight your hair.,
Try wearing flash tattoos.",How to Be Like Beyonce2," Although clearly influenced by singers like Janet Jackson, Madonna, and Tina Turner, Beyonce didn't set out to look or be just like some celebrity. She forged her own path and wrote her own recipe for success. You can't look just like Beyonce, and shouldn't try, if you want to really be like Beyonce.


Instead, learn what makes you look good and develop your own personal sense of style, based on your likes and dislikes, and your body style.
Dress your age, but dress well. Look elegant. Beyonce always looks stylish, regardless of what she's doing, and how formal the event.

, Beyonce's stage presence requires her to be in the peak of cardiovascular health. Whatever you do for a living, whatever your age, whatever type of body you have, it's a good idea to be active. Exercise a few times a week to stay in shape and make your physical health a priority.


It doesn't have to be a drag. Great, easy, Beyonce-like way to exercise? Crank up ""I Am...Sasha Fierce"" and dance like a fool. Sweat it out on the dancefloor.
Beyonce does interval training, switching back and forth between high-intensity and endurance exercises during a given period of time, to keep your body burning calories.

, Beyonce eats a healthy three square meals a day, focusing on whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables. On a recent tour, both she and Jay-Z even experimented with a ""vegan"" challenge for 22 days straight.You don't have to go all the way vegan if you don't want to, but eating a clean diet and avoiding simple carbohydrates, fatty foods, and sugars is a good idea for everyone.

, It's important to do what feels comfortable to you, regardless of what other people might tell you, or what is currently trendy, or what other people are doing. If you want to put makeup on, go for it. If you don't feel like putting makeup on, that's fine too. Don't depend on anything external to feel confident about yourself.


One of the great and notable and inspirational things about Beyonce Knowles is that she's not a rail-thin flake of a woman. She's got curves, and she proves to people everywhere that you don't have to fit into an unrealistic body-type mold to be sexy. Be proud of the body you have. That's sexy.

, Beyonce's hair is dynamic, flowing, sexy, and ombre. It's one of the first things you notice about any picture of Beyonce. Instead of having the two colors merge in the middle of the hair, her roots are a dark brown or black, while the rest of her hair is blonde.


At the hairdresser, go for a dynamic look like Beyonce has, coloring your hair if it's lighter, or getting highlights if it's already light.
Alternatively, just dig the hair you have. Natural hair is perfectly Beyonce-esque. It's more about attitude and less about looks anyway.

, Flash tattoos are temporary metallic tattoos that Beyonce has been wearing lately, on her Instagram feed. You can order these online for relatively cheap to try tapping into your ""fierce"" side.

Never call yourself a ""Justin Bieber Fan"" unless you only slightly like him.,
Memorize his song lyrics.,
Being a Belieber isn't about the merchandise.,
Learn the facts.,
Show it off.,
Make a Twitter fan account.,
Respect Justin's crew members.,
Try to put lots of posters on your wall of him!,
Remember, Beliebers are like a growing race of Justin Bieber supporters.",How to Be a Justin Bieber Fan," Justin's super-fans are called Beliebers and anyone who says that they're a fan won't be taken seriously by the Belieber community. There is a big difference between fans and Beliebers, and you don't want to be a fan. You're going to want to be a Belieber.;
, This is a very important part of being a Belieber. Every true Belieber knows the lyrics to all of his songs. Start with the older songs from his albums My World and My World 2.0 where you'll be able to find some of his classic songs such as One Time (My World) and Baby (My World 2.0)

, Of course, if you have some, that's a great bonus. Some Beliebers aren't able to afford the merchandise, so home-made things can also be really cool. If you ever go to a concert of Justin's, you'll notice a lot of the tee-shirts that the Beliebers wear are home-made.

, Every true Belieber knows the basics. We all know his birthday (March 1st, 1994 at 12:56 pm on a Tuesday in London, Ontario, Canada in St. Joseph's Hospital on the 2nd floor), his favorite color (purple), the names of the people in his crew, his half brother (Jaxon) and his sister (Jazzy), and stuff like that. Do some research and find out some of these things.

, Make sure everyone in your school knows you're a Belieber. You will be teased by haters, but every true Belieber is willing to put up with it. Make sure you have his pictures and name on your school binders.

, Twitter is the best way for Beliebers to connect with Justin and other Beliebers. Having a fan account on Twitter is important. Tweet on this account a lot, and try to get Justin to notice you when he's online. Also, help trend topics for Justin whenever you can by tweeting them. Until you have a lot of followers, you won't be able to start them, but you will be able to help trend ideas that come from bigger fan accounts.

, Don't just be there for Justin, and say rude things about Kenny (his bodyguard), Ryan Good (his ""swagger coach""), Scooter (his manager), etc. Those people are important to him, and any true Belieber wouldn't dis-respect them.

, When people come over to your house to have sleep overs, or play dates, they will see that you are a Justin Bieber fan and maybe spread it around to your friends and, you might be known as the #1 Belieber at you school. That would be awesome! You're good to go! Just follow these simple steps, and stay true. There isn't anything worse than a fake Belieber (what Beliebers call fans). If you become a Belieber, there is no leaving the family.

, Sometimes like a different species, so you have to be proud, because being a Belieber says that you are good-hearted. If you only care about Justin's looks you don't deserve to call yourself a Belieber..

Obtain a Marilyn Manson CD.,
Find a quiet time when you will not be disturbed to listen to the entire album while reading its lyrics along with the song.,
Listen for story.,
Listen for musical experimentation.,
Read the lyrics for more information.,
Analyze and interpret, study Manson's music, and soon you will realize what a truly brilliant mind he has, and will be thankful for the music he creates, and for the ideas that have provoked a new era of thought in your brain.

",How to Appreciate Marilyn Manson," This may take effort, as some major big box stores like Walmart and Target have banned Manson's CDs from being sold. Try a music shop, eBay, or borrow one from a friend. It's hard to say which one will be most important to you, the best thing to do is to look at each one carefully and see which one passes the best ""vibe"". Pick an album that feels right, even if your initially turned off by artwork or word phrasing. If this does not work, try Holy Wood, Mechanical Animals or Antichrist Superstar for a good introduction.;
, Manson can be hard to hear, and reading the lyrics along with the singing will help you to hear the words.

, In Manson's concept albums, the main character in the over-arching storyline is ""Adam Kadmon"", the androgynous alien/rockstar ""Omēga"", and ""The Worm/Antichrist Superstar"" on the Holy Wood, Mechanical Animals, and Antichrist Superstar albums, respectively. Manson reveals his message through the character's life, career, death, and eventual revival (check the MansonWiki's page on Holy Wood for the summary of the albums). It can be eye opening to listen from the prospective of the characters, but could also be disturbing to the listener, especially at intense moments. To get the full view of the story, the listener must pour through cryptic messages and symbols to line the songs up in a specific order, which luckily has been done for you.

, As of December 2006, any other CD is a work in itself and does not involve the character Adam. The Golden Age of Grotesque, for example, is an adventure into music, where the spoken word is not as important as the notes that are played. The musical style that prevails in this album is similar to a ""Burlesque"" type of music from the late 1920s. A much earlier album, Smells like Children is also an exploration into music with the focus on the obscene side of human nature. Manson's first album Portrait of an American Family is a fun, grotesque, deep look into American society. This album is not for those faint of heart, as its' lyrics tend to be on the vile side, but if you can stomach it, some of the music on the album is well worth listening to.

, In the lyrical booklets that come with the CDs there are certain passages that may be underlined or have symbolic marks. For example, on the song Kinderfeld on the Antichrist Superstar CD, certain passages will have names by them that are not said in the song, and Manson's voice will change as he sings them, suggesting conversation. It's then up to the listener to decide what that conversation means. In The Fight Song on the Holy Wood album, there is a well known quote by Joseph Stalin: The death of one is a tragedy, the death of millions is just a statistic. Knowing the context of a song helps the listener understand the significance of the music, and better appreciate the artist's goals.

Know that being gay is not a choice.,
Embrace the fact that he's gay.,
Let it go.",How to Accept That Adam Lambert Is Gay1," Adam Lambert can't just choose to stop being gay, and there is nothing that you can do to change it. He was born this way. Try to put yourself in Adam's shoes. Think about the things you were born with that you cannot change. Accept these things.
, Do not try to ignore it or escape it. Is it so hard to believe? Think about all of the ways that his sexuality makes him who he is. Consider how cool it is that he is so open and confident about his identity.

Since ""coming out,"" Adam has used his voice as a popular gay musician to speak about the ongoing struggle for marriage equality.Consider reading up on the issue. Try to understand why Adam thinks it is so important.

, Adam Lambert is gay. There are a lot of homosexual celebrities out there, and there are also a lot of heterosexual celebrities. Adam is one of the former."
"
Don't define him by his sexuality.,
Respect Adam as a human being.,
Think about how Adam wants to be seen.",How to Accept That Adam Lambert Is Gay2," Try to focus on Adam's music instead of his love life. Listen to his songs, watch videos of his performances, or see him in concert to remind yourself of his talent. The fact that he is gay does not change his music, even if it changes the way that you approach his music.

When you read his lyrics, you don't need to think about Adam with another guy. Instead, let his lyrics lead you to think about your own feelings and experiences. Music is meant to make you feel things, not necessarily to make you think about the artist.

, Remember that his sexuality does not define his worth. He is as deserving of love, respect, and admiration as anyone else., He didn't make a big show of his homosexuality when he was on American Idol because he didn't want his personal life to steal the spotlight from his music.He wants his fans to appreciate him as a musician, not necessarily as a ""gay musician."" Ask yourself whether being a ""gay musician"" is any different from being a musician.

Consider this analogy. Imagine that you are a devout Christian, and also an amazing artist. Would you want someone to pass over your art for the sole reason that you are Christian?

, Lady Gaga is an accomplished songwriter and composer. Many pop artists do not write their own songs.

, At first, many of her songs seem nonsensical and silly, but some of them actually have deep meanings. For example, the song ""Paparazzi"" can serve as a love song but also as a story about a tragic death caused by the paparazzi. (Such as the death of Princess Diana) Her song ""Speechless"" is also a heartfelt ballad for her father. Her most shallow songs become popular, because that’s what the public wants apparently.

, She learned to play the piano by ear at age four, and wrote her very first song soon afterwards. She also wrote her first complete piano ballad at age thirteen, and started performing at fourteen.

, She attended a Roman Catholic school known as the Convent of the Sacred Heart. (She was originally set to attend the Julian School at Manhattan.) At age seventeen, she was one out of twenty in the world to gain early admission to the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts.

Connect with other songwriters and music professionals.",How to Put a Tune to Song Lyrics," The tone of your song will guide a lot of the choices you make regarding the tune. For example, lyrics that are sinister and dark would be suited to minor chords or scales, which generally sound gloomy, somber, or creepy.A bright, happy sounding song would work well with major chords and scales. Experiment to find what works best with your lyrics.
Light, frolicsome lyrics could work well with quick, split note rhythms, like runs of eighth or sixteenth notes.
Dramatic lyrics can be highlighted with power chords. Use these to punch up drama at points throughout the song.;
, Your tune should have contour. A gentle rise and fall in the tones of your tune would be suitable for soft, mellow, or soulful songs, like pastorals or songs about natural beauty. Large tonal jumps can add edge, heightened emotion, and showmanship, like might be suitable for a rock ballad.Ask yourself, ""What is the setting of this song?"" Use this question as a guide for the choices you make when producing the tune.
What images are brought to mind when you read the lyrics? If you see gentle, rolling hills, you could decrease the tonal contour of the tune to imitate this quality.
Setting includes weather and atmospheric lighting. Songs that might be useful for gaining a sense of this include ""L'orage"" (The Storm) by Burgmuller, ""The Planets"" by Holst, and Prelude, Op 28, No. 15 (""Raindrop"") by Chopin.

, Your song may have a quality similar to a living creature, like ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"" by Rimsky-Korsakov. In this song, Rimsky-Korsakov uses quick runs of broken notes to imitate the chaotic, rapid fluttering of wings and the industriousness of bees.Your lyrics may have the sense of a creeping predator, like a large cat stalking its prey. This could be imitated in the tune with a flowing tonal contour that builds to edgy minor chords.
There may be a point in your song that moves at a gallop, like a horse. Include broken note runs and bright, free sounding major chords.
Other songs you might want to listen to for a better understanding of the living quality of songs include ""Dragonfly Keeper"" by Phildel, ""Madama Butterfly"" by Puccini, and the French horn (wolf) part of the opera Peter and the Wolf by Prokofiev.

, Staff paper has groupings of five lines on which musical notes are drawn. Alternatively, you can type up your lyrics in a music making program on a computer. Placing the lyrics side by side with the staff will help you to connect each word/syllable of your lyrics with its associated part in the tune.Some music making programs you can use on your computer include Ableton Live, Fruity Loops (FL) Studio, Steinberg Cubase Pro, and Apple Logic Pro.It's best to use a pencil when drafting your song on staff paper. You'll likely have to make changes as the song develops.

, This is a simple way of making sure each syllable gets a note. In some cases, you may want to sustain a note through several syllables or break up a note into a run for a single syllable.Even if you plan on stretching a note out over many syllables, breaking lyrics into syllables will help you keep track of the beat.

, Generally, each syllable of the lyrics should receive a tone. This forms the main throughline of the song, often referred to as the ""melody.""Keep the overall contour, imagery, and alive (animalistic) qualities of your lyrics in mind while choosing the range of tones for your tune.Sometimes, at the end of a musical phrase, a sustained note can add impact and feeling. Experiment with sustained notes to find what works best for your lyrics.
In some cases, you may want to leave out music to showcase the lyrics. This is called a ""rest"" in music. Try inserting a rest for certain syllables to add tension.

, If you're making music on your computer, you'll likely be able to play the melody you've composed through headphones or speakers. Listen to the recording throughout the composing process, and adjust it to suit your preferences and style.

Listen to your track and the various parts you add to it throughout the music production. Sometimes tones, chords, or instruments that you expect will work won't sound very good, and vice versa.
Continue to make adjustments to the parts you've written or the parts you'll add later as your song takes shape. Change the music with your pencil and eraser or composing software on your computer.

, Be sparing with the instruments you add. Too many can contribute to a muddy or oversaturated sound. Limiting the number of instruments (including voices) you add to your song to seven or fewer will help prevent this.Create harmony between the main throughline of your song (melody) and the parts played by other instruments.
Add more instruments to the mix when at high energy, dramatic, or emphasized moments in your lyrics. Doing so can amplify these qualities.

, It's likely you'll spend a lot of time working on your song. This makes it easy to miss certain things. A fresh pair of ears can help you identify trouble spots. Ask for specific feedback and use this to adjust your song or create new songs.Your family and friends may not be completely honest with you to protect your feelings. For this reason, you should also play your song for people who don't know you as well.

, Record your song, if necessary. Post it on platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud, BandCamp, Spotify, and more.Use appropriate tags and labels when you post, like ""drum and bass,"" ""folk music,"" or ""hip hop."" Without proper tagging and labeling, your uploaded music will be hard for listeners to find.

Remember to include sub-genres or associated tags. To the tag ""drum and bass,"" you might add, ""uptempo,"" ""sunny,"" or ""liquid"" to provide more information on your song at a glance.
Use the public reaction to your song to improve it. However, take online criticism with a grain of salt. Some critique may be unfounded or even cruel.

, Use social media, like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and similar social media sites to connect with fans. Post information about new releases, merchandise, and upcoming performances. Communicate and network with other music professionals through these sites.

Building an online following can take a lot of work. Many professional songwriters have their online accounts managed by publicists and agents.
Hold contests through social media to drum up fan involvement. For example, you might give away free merchandise to certain fans through a social media raffle., Relationships with other songwriters and music professionals can open up new opportunities for your career. These people can put you in touch with event staff, help you promote new work, and might even be valuable collaborators down the road.


A business card will make it easy for you to pass off your contact information to suitable individuals even at distracting or loud events.
Send a friendly message through email or social media to new acquaintances after you meet them."

Whether you're recording in your garage or at Abbey Road studios, you'll want to have your entire song figured out before you start to record. This saves you the time of having to re-record numerous takes as you figure out your song and, if you're using a professional studio, the money needed to pay for studio time.


This means that your song's structure needs to be more or less decided-upon when you arrive at the studio, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you need to have every note pre-planned. Some artists, for instance, record their solos live in the studio. In some genres of music, like Jazz, entire sections of the song can be improvised — still, even in these cases, the musicians know when to begin and end each part of the song and how to stay in time with one another.
For more information, see How to Write a Song.;
, Not every song you record has to be an original. You can also record your own version of someone else's song (called a cover). There are no significant legal hurdles to recording a cover, though you are obligated to give the original songwriter credit if you sell your version commercially.Some of music's biggest hits have been covers (though this is not always well-known among fans of the songs). Below are just a few famous covers:""Tainted Love"" by Soft Cell (originally by Gloria Jones)
""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" by Cyndi Lauper (originally by Robert Hazard)
""Hound Dog"" by Elvis Presley (originally by Willie Mae ""Big Mama"" Thornton)
""All Along the Watchtower"" by Jimi Hendrix (originally by Bob Dylan)
""Jolene"" by the White Stripes (originally by Dolly Parton)
""I Think We're Alone Now"" by Tiffany (originally by Tommy James and the Shondells)

, No matter when and where you're recording, it's always in your best interest to practice your song until you know it like the back of your (hopefully callused) hands. By the time you turn on the mics, you'll want to be able to reliably play through the entire song without making anything rather than insignificant, tiny errors. If you can't, you risk wasting lots of time playing your song over and over as you try for a perfect take.


This is especially important if you're using a professional recording studio. While you can easily get away with making a few mistakes when you're recording in your garage, showing up to a recording studio unprepared can be embarrassing and costly. Studio time can be quite expensive (it's not rare for the services of a reasonably high quality studio to run at $100 per hour or more), so every time you make a mistake and need to start over, you're losing money. Plus, experienced sound engineers are present when you record in the studio — do you want to mess up in front of them over and over?

, Just like you'll want to be able to play through your song without mistakes before you begin recording, you'll also want to have all of the equipment and accessories that you need to make your music sound just right before you step into the studio. While many professional studios will have various amps, cables, effects pedals, and even instruments handy, there's no guarantee that they'll have exactly what you need to sound the way you want, so don't count on this. Instead, have all of your equipment with you to avoid the hassle of adjusting to a new setup.


Obviously, if you're recording at home, all you'll be able to use is the equipment you have (or whatever you can borrow from a friend).

, When it comes to home recording, you're only really limited by the time you have at your disposal and the money you want to spend on equipment. Depending on the recording setup you want to have, the cost of home recording gear can range from about $100 to many thousands of dollars. At the very least, you'll need to buy at least one microphone of reasonable quality to record your voice and/or instruments. Don't rely on your computer's built-in mic — these are almost always too poor of quality to make a good recording with.


Even among good-quality microphones, you have many, many options. The most affordable mics will cost about $100, while high-end items can retail for several thousand dollars.If you're trying to make electronic music without any vocals, you may be able to get away without having a microphone. However, in this case, you may need sampling equipment, extra software, and so on.

, To make a good recording at home, you'll need software on your computer that's up to the task. Here, you have a great deal of flexibility — professional recording software can easily cost $1,000, but a variety of cheap and free alternatives are perfectly serviceable for many amateur musicians' needs. Before you begin to record, be sure that your recording software is installed on your computer and is working properly. This means you'll probably want to test your microphone and any additional hardware to make sure that your software is picking up audio. Below are a few cheap and free audio recording programs you may want to consider:


Audacity (free)
Wavosaur (free)
Wavepad (free)
Garageband (free; only available for iOS; add-on features cost $5)
FL Studio ($99 and up for full version; $10-$20 for touch-based versions), At a professional studio, the first thing you'll usually record is a performance track. All the musicians will play through the entire song together without stopping, even if minor mistakes occur. Then, after that, they'll play their individual tracks along to the audio of the performance. However, if you're recording in a home studio, unless you've sunk some serious cash into your setup, you probably don't have enough equipment to have every musician miked at once. Thus, you'll probably want to begin by recording the rhythm section. In a typical rock band setup, this is drum, bass, rhythm guitar, and any auxiliary percussion your song has. Record drums first, then auxiliary percussion, then bass, and finally rhythm guitar.


The tracks you lay down for these instruments will be used to help keep the other instruments on beat as they play, so be sure that the rhythmic section is perfectly ""locked in"" to the beat of the song.
To help the members of the rhythm section stay on beat, it may be helpful to use a metronome or click track. Most recording software will have the ability to use the latter built-in.

, After you've laid down the rhythm section, it's time for you to add any lead instrumental lines. Lead guitar, synths, keyboards, and much more can be recorded at this point. As a general rule, if the instrument plays a melody or counter-melody line, you'll want to record it here.


As you record each instrument, play over the tracks you've already recorded. This way, each instrument you record is easier to keep on beat than the last.

, When you've laid down all of your instrumental tracks and you're satisfied with their quality, finally, record any vocal parts. If there is only one vocal part in your song, you may conceivably be able to do this in one take, but if your song has harmony lines, you'll need to record each separately.


For singers, a good strategy is to carefully rest their voice the entire day of recording until it's time to sing. Try to avoid singing, shouting, or talking for long periods of time. Drink plenty of water. Some singers like to soothe their vocal chords with tea and honey. Avoid dairy, as this can produce a ""phlegmy"" feeling in the throat that can hamper good singing., After you've recorded all of the tracks you'll need for your song, take a moment to celebrate — the nerve-wracking part is over. Next, you'll use your editing software to fine-tune your performances. Look and listen for minor inconsistencies in rhythm and tone and use the tools provided in your editing software to smooth out these rough spots. Every editing program will be somewhat different, but nearly all will allow you to adjust the volume and left/right alignment of all tracks, delete and copy content, and apply special effects. Use your recording software's tools to give your song the level of polish you're looking for.


Save often as you edit. Make a duplicate save every time you make a major change. Losing work and having to re-record at this point is a major pain and a huge waste of valuable time.

, Finally, you've finished — your parts are all recorded and you've edited your song so that it's as perfect as it will ever be. To complete the process, save your file in a common audio format like .mp3, .wav., .flac, .ogg using the recording software's ""export"" or ""publish"" function (usually under the ""File"" or equivalent tab in the menu bar).


When your file is saved in its new format, you can use it as you please. You may, for instance, want to email it to a friend, burn it to a CD, or upload it to an online streaming service.

, Unlike recording at home, recording in the studio isn't the sort of thing you can approach casually when you have a few hours free on a Friday. Studios are busy, high-cost businesses, so, for your benefit and the studio's, you'll need to schedule a block of time during which you'll record your song. The amount of time you'll need depends on how complex your song is. Simple songs, like ones involving only an acoustic guitar and a vocal melody, can conceivably be recorded within a few hours, while songs involving a whole band can easily take 10 to 15 hours.


As an alternative to expensive commercial studios, try contacting a local art school or a university's art department. Some schools will allow musicians to record their songs for free so that students studying music production can have a chance to practice their skills on the school's professional-quality equipment.

, One of the biggest differences between recording at home and recording in the studio is that, for the latter, time (both yours and the studio's) is always a serious concern. The longer you take in the studio, the more you'll spend, and bills can rack up quite fast. At a small but professional-quality studio, it can take anywhere from about a hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars to complete the recording process for a single song.Because these base costs will only increase if you have to spend extra time recording, you'll want to have your song completely mastered by the time you arrive at the studio.

, Generally, once the studio engineer has finished setting up her equipment, the fist thing you'll do is play through the entire song once without stopping. This ""performance track"" should include all of the musicians present — you want it to be as close to a ""real"" live performance as possible. Though you'll want to do your best, it's not the end of the world if you make tiny mistakes at this point, as none of the tracks from this performance will typically make it into the finished product unless they're exceptionally good.

, After you (and any other musicians present) record your performance take, you'll play and sing your individual parts over it as you listen to it (and, sometimes, a click track) through a set of headphones. Having a performance that's basically ""correct"" to play over generally makes the process of recording much quicker and easier, though it can sometimes take a little time to find a volume level that allows you to hear yourself over the performance take as you play. Record your tracks in roughly the same order as you would at home: first drums, then any auxiliary percussion, then bass, then rhythm guitar, then lead guitar and any other lead instruments, and finally vocals.


Ideally, you'll want to record each track within a few takes, rather than having to waste time on many takes, so, as noted above, try to know your song very well before recording. Some jitters at the outset of the recording process can be unavoidable, especially if it's your first time, so some engineers will recommend you participate in some short ice breakers or relaxing activities before beginning.

, As you record (and after), your engineer may share ideas about how certain instruments or sections should sound. She may, for instance, recommend adding a certain after-effect, like reverb, to your vocals to give them the quality of being performed in a large room with a slight echo. Or, she may have suggestions about the studio banter you want to bookend your song with — maybe it's too long or distracting. In any case, it's up to you to communicate with your engineer about the way you'd like your recording to sound and to accept or reject any suggestions she makes.


It's your recording, but the engineer does this for a living, so be sure to at least consider her advice. Engineers typically won't comment on the structure or composition of your song, just its sound quality, so there's no reason to be insulted if an engineer wants to try something a little different than you expected.
This being said, keep in mind that time spent experimenting with different sound palettes is time you can't get back, so try to keep any experimentation brief.

, When recording is done, you can leave and you may be given an ""un-mastered"" copy of your recording, but the work isn't over yet. After this point, the recording typically goes to a mastering engineer, who makes precise adjustments to the recording to ensure that it sounds as good as possible in a process called ""mastering"". Mastering involves adjusting the relative volumes of the tracks in the recording, ensuring internal consistency by adjusting the recording's EQ and gain, using compression to give the recording a consistent volume, and much more.Skipping the mastering stage can result in a recording that sounds ""thin"" or imbalanced, so this is recommended for almost everyone who records in a professional setting.


Mastering carries its own cost in addition to the basic recording process. This is often at least $100-150 per song and can be much more.
This is especially important if you intend your track to be heard on the radio, as all major commercial releases are mastered., If you have plenty of material to record and the time and resources to do it, consider recording an album or EP. An album is the standard collection of 8-15 songs or so that represents a major release for a musician, while an EP (short for ""Extended Play"") is a shorter collection of songs that is usually only 3-5 tracks long. With an album or EP under your belt, you can start treating yourself as a serious artist and even make money by selling your work!

, If you've just recorded some hot new tracks, take advantage of modern internet technology and share them with your fans! Streaming services like Youtube, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp allow you to host and share your songs for very cheap or free after registering an account, making this an ideal option for those looking to reach the largest audience possible on a budget.


To quickly promote the song or album to all of your friends and family members, you may also want to try posting a link to your album on your social media (Facebook, etc.) profile.

, If, after listening to your new recording, you're convinced that you have a future hit on your hands, try contacting someone with the power to get your music on the radio and in stores. For instance, you may want to try arranging a meeting with the staff at a small independent record label or sending your music to live venues in the local area for a shot at a paying gig. Regardless of what you do, the best way to get noticed in the industry is to stay active — play shows, release new music, and take a decisive role in your musical career.


In addition, some radio stations (especially college stations) accept music submissions from independent artists.

Another way to find publishers is to pick up Billboard Magazine, look up songs on the Hot 100, R&B or Country charts in your genre, and see the accompanying list of publishers.Call the publisher to confirm who you should send your music to, and in what format.

, This is so important that if you don't live in or near a city where people can make a living writing songs (a 'music centre') then you should seriously consider moving.Attend industry functions
Hang out wherever the 'movers and shakers' in your industry and genre hang out
Go to songwriter nights
Join relevant associations

In Canada: SOCAN (The Society of composers, authors and music publishers in Canada)
In the US: BMI or ASCAP


Be assertive yet polite when meeting key people in the industry; remember that they are probably bombarded by pushy starving artists every day.Co-write songs with both published and unpublished artists (you never know when someone you've worked with will introduce you to their publisher, now or later)

, Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether or not to sign with a particular publisher:How quickly can the publisher pay?
Does the publisher have an international network to collect money abroad via sub-publishing agreements or via membership of overseas collection societies?
How is publishing income split with songwriting partners or other members of the band? Straighten this out from the start so you don't battle it out later in court.
If the person who signed you leaves the company, are there others who are as enthusiastic about your music as they were who can pick up where they left off?
Does the publisher specialize in your genre?
Can the publisher pay an advance?
Do you prefer a large or small publisher?

Record your songs onto CDs and sell them at shows, through your website, or and/or through a third-party website.

,
Optional: Make your songs available for downloading (at whatever cost you deem appropriate).,
Register with a performance rights organization (PRO).",How to Publish Your Music2,", You can do this through your own website or through a third-party website. A simple personal site doesn't present many difficulties, however, if you would like to create something more refined, like establish an online store - that would demand more knowledge and efforts. At some of the platforms you can sell not only sheet music but also the rights for its performance., This is essential so if airplay and other public uses of your music occur, you can get paid.


Pick a name for your publishing company. This is what checks will be made out to.
Register with BMI or ASCAP (in the US) as a publisher. Register as a musician as well for whichever organization you choose. ASCAP has a $50 non-refundable fee for applying as a musician or a publisher.BMI will charge a $150 non-refundable processing fee to register as a publisher (or $250 if you are incorporated).ASCAP has a more flexible agreement.Once the name is approved, file a DBA (Doing Business As) application at a bank. This is done so you can cash checks made out to your publishing company.
Register each of your songs.

You might also record a drummer friend or a sick guitar riff and use these live samples as part of production.


Generally, live samples will sound most natural. Human listeners crave imperfection in sound production, and live performers each have their own unique, imperfect style.Sometimes you can convince musician friends of yours to take part in live sampling if you give them credit or acknowledge them.;
, If you want to independently produce your own tracks, a computer that can run music production software will be necessary. When selecting a suitable computer, consider:


Investing in a laptop if you plan on traveling or performing live. This will enable you perform live more easily, as your entire selection can be stored and transported on your laptop.
Investing in a desktop if you plan on producing music on your own at home. These machines will faithfully run most audio production software.
Using a Mac if you plan on using the digital audio workstations (DAWs) Pro Tools, Garageband, or Logic. These programs are either Mac-only releases or are designed to work best with Mac specifications.
Prioritizing processor speed. A 3.0 processor that’s a dual core or better will help your computer to run fluidly with little to no lag.
Using 8 GB of RAM and 500 GB of hard drive space (minimum) to support an extensive sound library and the smooth-running of your computer.
Saving money on your video card. Unless you also do video editing, a high-end video card won’t add much to your music production., Recording equipment can add a significant expense to your equipment costs. Most digital audio workstations (DAWs) can digitally produce sounds so entire tracks can be made on the computer. Recording equipment includes things like microphones, booms, filters, sound booths, and so on.


Recordings of live players generally are warmer and require less finishing. Isolated soundbites can sound cold, which can be corrected in the finishing stage of the production process.

, A digital audio workstation (DAW) will give you the most freedom with production. Many DAWs come with digital drum machines, synthesizers, soundbite libraries, and more. Some popular DAWs you might consider include:



Image-Line FL Studio is the frontrunner among the Fruity Loops platform. This powerful DAW includes an Image-Line lifetime free update policy.

Ableton Live is powerful as a recording program for composers and it works well as a performance instrument as well. This program is supported by interface hardware like the Push 2 controller, which allows for a physically reactive (push key sound production) kind of music production.

Steinberg Cubase Pro offers unique interface options, like chromatic sampling and the Lower Zone project window to improve mixing and other fine-tuning tools panels/tabs., It can be difficult capturing the explosive nature of a musical instant when only dealing with abstract sound information in computer files. Physical production and recording equipment, like drum machines, microphones, synthesizers, keyboards, electric guitars, and controllers can make production and recording more intuitive and interactive.Identify pieces of equipment you’d likely use often in your production. For example, if you had musical training in piano, a quality keyboard would likely be a useful investment.
This kind of equipment can be very expensive. Building up production and recording accessories generally takes time and continual investment.
Even though this equipment can be useful, canned music production, like drum machines, oftentimes require extensive finishing before sounding natural., This is the foundation of your track. The bassline will be the lowest tone in the track, generally a drum or keyboard tone. It is often repetitive and steady, though some basslines are characterized by more complex structure, like drum and bass, which uses a syncopated beat.Use the steady beat of a kick drum to create a basic bassline.

Count rhythms and add in offbeats, like a sixteenth note run on the second and fourth beats of your bassline.
You never know what you’ll come up with when making your bassline. Let your instincts guide you. Don’t attempt for perfection; creating a starting point is the goal of this step., Drums and cymbals give a lot of punch to the tracks you produce. A steady kick drum (or bass drum) might work for the main bassline, but a drumroll on a snare drum or the clap of a high-hat will add more depth to your bassline.


These percussion riffs generally occur at regular intervals or as part of loops throughout a track. The frequency of these will depend on your style and preference.

, The through line of your bass will be the repeated, steady theme of the bass part. This, however, will change at times to showcase solos, to highlight parts, to spotlight instrumental duets or vocals, and so on. These digressions keep your bassline from becoming too repetitive and boring.


A bridge is a connecting musical interlude to the main through line of a song, usually occurring in the middle of the song. Experiment with changes in rhythm, melody, and more when including bridges in your tracks.Be careful not to add too many parts to your bassline. Too much instrumental variety can result in a muddy sound. Two to three instruments here would be most suitable to start with. Use simple, repeatable patterns., The melody of your song is the main part of a song that rises and falls, creating the pattern around which the rest of the track is structured.Think of the melody as the main part of a song you’d hum along with.


Choose a main instrument for your melody. Popular choices include the guitar, keyboard, horns (like trumpets or trombones), organs, synth tones, wind instruments (flutes, clarinets), and more.
Have your melody travel a range of tones to give it contour. Break up tones to skip up and down to higher and lower tones. Make chords by playing tones together.
Don’t be afraid to use silence. Adding a slight pause (often referred to in music as a “rest”) to your melody can build tension.
Your melody should consist of a single instrument. In some cases, a pair of instruments can also be used. When starting out, using more than one instrument might cause muddiness or oversaturation in the end result of your track., Two instruments here is a good place to start. Too many instruments in your track can weigh down its sound, making it heavy and indistinct.Play these accent instruments in harmony to the melody. Add them sparing throughout the melody to accent the overall contour of the through line.Popular instruments used supplemental to the melody include: keyboard (sparse notes), trumpets, trombones, flutes, clarinets, marimbas, accordions, bagpipes, and others.

, At a climactic moment, like after you’ve built up some tension in your track and are getting ready to drop the beat, you can add emphasis with instrumental riffs. These are especially popular on the guitar and piano, and can often be used effectively in power chords.


A few accent notes at low, downtempo spots in your song can add depth and an edgy sense to its overall tone.
Unusual sounds, like DJ Premier’s iconic use of birds chirping to highlight the potent drumline, can have a profound effect on your track.
Remember to keep things simple when you’re adding instruments to your melody and bassline. It’s easy to get carried away, but this can negatively impact the instrumental balance in your song., Your main vocals are generally sung by a single person. The main vocals in most cases follow along with the melody to the beat of the bassline, though there may be times when a vocalist harmonizes with the instrumental melody or vice versa.Depending on the track you are producing, you may even want to leave out vocals.



Write lyrics for your song that mean something to you or that are in line with the feeling you want to convey with your song.
When starting out, one set of main vocals might be best. Secondary vocals, like that of a guest vocalist or a duet, can be effective in your track, but might be hard to balance while learning the basics of production.

, There are moments, like at the end of a verse or the chorus, where the main vocals can oftentimes be naturally accented with harmony. Experiment by adding harmonic vocals to moments of high tension, the ends of musical phrases, and parts of the song you want to stress.


Adding too many harmonic vocals, much like adding too many instruments, can bog down your sound, making it muddy. Use supporting harmonic vocals sparingly.Your placement of these vocals is ultimately a matter of preference and taste. Experiment by harmonizing at various points in the song and seeing what you like., This is a good way to limit supplemental vocals from muddying your sound. At moments you wish to emphasize, like at the end of a phrase or on some killer lyrics, double or triple the main vocal to create a fuller sound.


You can modify the tones of the overdubs to create harmony with a single voice. The chord created by these tones will be naturally pleasing since they are produced by the same voice., Have others listen to your song. Be prepared for critique. Listen to the feedback of others carefully. Soften sounds that are piercing and tinny, add substance to the parts your listeners find lacking. This might involve adding more instrumentals or simply balancing the volume.


Start by having friends and family listen to your track. However, these people will often care about your feelings and may not give you the most honest evaluation.
After building your confidence a little bit, have someone who isn’t as close to you, like an acquaintance or colleague with similar music tastes, listen to your track., Keep the volume moderately low when doing this. Over long mixing sessions, volume tends to creep upward, which can be bad for your hearing. Color code parts to improve efficiency while mixing. Balance the volumes of the parts of your track and accentuate prominent parts.Compression tools can help you maintain consistent volume throughout your track. Digital versions of these are available as part of DAWs or supplemental software packages.
A common color scheme to improve mixing efficiency uses purple for bass, blue for drums, red for vocals, and orange for instruments. , Take a look at the audio range of the track as a whole in a mastering program. This may be a separate program or part of your DAW. Look at the fades, the parameters of the sound (how large/small its frequency). Soften and round out extreme parts to make the sound fluid and seamless., The tracks you produce won't gain popularity unless you make them available to the public. Post your songs to platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Spotify, and more.Include relevant tags for your songs so listeners can search for and find your music more easily.Include genre specific tags, like one for hip hop or pop, and subgenres where applicable, like Electro Pop.
Keep an eye on tracks you post. Tracks with many likes, thumbs ups, or positive responses can guide your production of future tracks.

, Many fans like to know what their favorite artists are saying about daily events. Interact with your fans on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and similar social networking sites. Use social media to communicate with local DJs and producers in your city or region. Post information on upcoming tracks.Developing a following on social media can be a lot of work. In many cases, producers use a publicist or agent to manage their social media accounts.
Sponsor social media contests, like one-on-one question and answer sessions or merchandise giveaways., Make a business card and bring it to clubs and live music events. Hand your card to DJs, event coordinators, club managers, and other individuals. Attend after parties for events and shows to solidify your relationships with acquaintances involved in music production.If you receive the contact information from someone involved in the music scene, send them a friendly message or an invitation to collaborate., Go onstage as a DJ and showcase your tunes. If you're more of a behind-the-scenes producer, contact local DJs or club music planners through social media or personal connections. Introduce them to your best work, then see if they'll play one of your songs."

After all, you can't sell your music if you don’t have anything recorded, but thanks to advancing technologies, most small towns these days have their own recording studios where musicians can go to record a few tracks or entire albums at relatively low prices.


Check online to see if there are any local recording studios in your town, as the added quality of a semi-professional recording could make all the difference when you're trying to get people to pay for your music.
Simply search for “recording studios” and the name of the city where you live, and all the nearest studios will be listed.;
, These days, music is sold through different avenues, and each of these requires a different format. For instance, you can sell physical copies of your music on CDs or vinyl at concerts, but you'll need digital versions if you want to sell your music online and through electronic stores.


When you go in to record your tracks, get them pressed onto CDs and onto vinyl if possible, and keep digital versions of everything as well.

, There are a multitude of digital music stores out there, and many of them have their own music apps that are used by different mobile devices—such as iTunes for Apple, Google Play for Android devices, Band Camp, and Amazon Music. As an artist, you can sell your music directly through these media.Some of these digital stores make it difficult for individuals to sell their music, and prefer that musicians use third-party networks.
To sell music through iTunes, for instance, you need an Apple ID, a Universal Product Code, an International Standard Recording Code, and a U.S. tax ID., These types of networks specialize in partnering with digital music stores and streaming services, and when you sell your music to these affiliates, you're paying for them to get your music sold through the most popular digital avenues. Moreover, these sites will be able to deal with all the red tape involved in selling your music digitally, and will format your music to the various specifications of different stores.Some of the more popular digital distribution networks include:


Ditto
Songcast
TuneCore
Awal

, Just as digital music stores are places where you can sell your own music to people around the world, so too are there digital stores dedicated to selling beats, samples, and instrumental music. Like the digital stores and distribution networks, some of these sites work on a subscription basis while others are pay-per-tune. The most popular music production sales sites include:


Soundgine
My Flash Store
Beat Stars
Firstdub

, You can sell copies of your records to people the same way people buy clothes online. When somebody purchases your album, they also pay shipping and taxes, and then you mail a physical copy of your record to their address. You can do this through your own website if you have one, your Facebook page, or through sites like CDBaby.


CDBaby makes their money by taking a cut of every sale, but they can also convert digital copies of your music into CD formats.

, There are many venues where independent artists can sell their own music, and this includes local shows and concerts, coffee shops, art galleries, and markets. Some places, like coffee shops, may ask for a small fee in return for managing your display, while farmer’s markets might require you to pay for a booth.


If you're looking for other venues through which to sell your music, ask around in the local arts and music scene to find businesses that are open to helping out local artists, and approach those businesses and ask if you can set up a display to sell records.

, When you want to make a living as a musician, you must reach as many people as possible an promote yourself all the time, because the more fans you have, the more people there are to buy your music. These days, one of the best ways to reach new fans is through social media and having friends, family, and fans share your music with others.Along with having accounts with all the popular social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Myspace, to name a few), you should also update them regularly and share your songs, performances, and videos there.

, While social media and digital marketing are important, you still have to get out there and perform all the time. Think outside the box when you're looking for gigs, and try to book yourself at events like weddings, parties, and charity events, along with the traditional concerts, shows, and club performances.


By performing in front of live audiences, you will build a stronger fan following, develop a solid local market, and each show will bring more exposure and new fans., This is a more traditional way of getting your music out there, and it is still important for artists to get airplay. When you send your demo, be sure to address a specific DJ, and try to target a person that tends to play music in your genre. Today, however, musicians aren't limited to local radio stations, so also send a few of your tracks to:College and university stations
Web radio stations
Satellite radio stations
Music bloggers

, Agents are great because it’s their job to help make you more popular and get you paying gigs. Not only that, but if you're looking to get signed, agents are a huge asset because they have connections within the industry.


An agent’s job is to negotiate for you, find and book performances, and arrange show details, among other tasks.Many of the larger labels don’t accept unsolicited demos, so an agent can get your foot in the door., This is only necessary if you want to sign a record deal with an actual label, which isn't strictly necessary these days. But a record label will help take care of promoting your music and selling records, which will take some of the pressure off you.


If you do want to get signed with an existing label, send copies of your best work to producers and executives at the labels you want to work with.Don’t forget about digital record labels and netlabels such as 8Bitpeoples and Monstercat.

Decide what type of music you would listen to.,
Start with your beat.,
Devise the bassline.,
Begin layering.,
Listen to how the music sounds.,
After you feel that you have a cool sounding song then work on a change midways through the song.,
Make lyrics if you choose to.,
Produce the song.",How to Produce and Write Dance Music," The only way to do this is to listen to a large amount of different music until you find the sound or style that you like the most. The main ones are Trance, House, Drum n Bass, Garage, Hip Hop, UK/Happy Hardcore and more. There are plenty of other totally different types of sub genres to these. Don't be limited by genres and pop charts look for new artists and experiment.;
, The beat holds the song together and controls how good the music is. To make a good beat, listen to dance music and try to pick out the characteristics of the drums only. Dance music is almost always in 4/4 such as Galvanize by The Chemical Brothers in which they throw in a 2/4 bar every few instrumental measures. Hi hat sounds good with straight eighth notes or sixteenths. Snare drum is used to accent and syncopate the beat. Try to use electronic snare and stay away from the clap, because that is used a lot in hip-hop.

, Dance music is based on repetition and usually starts with the catchy bassline. The bassline can also be a rhythm on a chord progression that you make.

, The farther you progress in the song the more action there should be. Usually some layers are rhythms on the chord progression, others are the same note or riff played over and over despite the progression.

, If something doesn't sound right then it is up to you to figure out why it doesn't sound right. All music is based upon theory and the same theory has been used over 400 years ago. The reason to study theory is to learn about what musicians of the past discovered by themselves.

, You can take out the drums and bass to leave a string riff or you can have a cool beat play alone. Also, you can change styles completely. Like I mentioned before this is your song. You have to be the creative one.

, Listen to your favorite dance songs. You may want to rap or make two lines that rhyme and sound cool to repeat in certain parts of the song. Also, you can make it in a rock format with a verse and a chorus. Finally, you can take out your 40 year old nursery rhymes or favorite Robert Frost poem and read or sing it! It's up to you.

, Find someone that can record the music or get it onto a computer unless you can do it yourself. Then make final touches just in case there are some malfunctions. Then you can get an official record label by sending some demos of songs to give to them. You need to learn the business side of music to get successful, so check out the external links.

Understand that Rebecca Black learned from her mistakes with ""Friday"".,
Admire the meaning of My Moment.,
Listen to her new music with an open mind.,
Expect more singles and albums to be released.",How to Appreciate Rebecca Black's Music," Realize that she was only 13 years old when she released Friday, and has since become remarkably known throughout America. Her mother spent $4,000 for her song to be made into a single and the same week it was released to the Internet.Although it was for all the wrong reasons, her single Friday went viral on YouTube, receiving over 167 million views before being taken off of YouTube due to, according to the video, copyright reasons. Additionally, it is possible that the video was removed from YouTube also due to negative/threatening comments and cyber-bullying, which had a very strong impact on Black's life,with the result of Black being homeschooled instead of being taught at a school.


Notice that not very long after removing Friday from YouTube, Rebecca Black re-posted the video on YouTube, despite influence to not repost the video. This can show that Rebecca Black was not afraid of threats and hatred.;
, Although the lyrics are so simple and obvious that they're silly, think about how relatable they really are for teenagers. Everyone wakes up in the morning and has breakfast, and people do look forward to the weekend. Although the lyrics are repetitive, they ring true.

, If you listen closely to the beats of the song and, you will realize what a creative song she created. The song uses an I-vi-IV-V chord progression. Many other popular songs have used this chord progression. ""Friday"" is performed in the key of B major with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. The familiar structure makes the song catchy.

, Black used auto-tune in Friday, meaning that her voice was edited a lot. Realize that because of the excessive use of Auto-Tune, Rebecca's real voice is not portrayed in the song, so she is not necessarily as bad a singer as it seems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with her musical talent because her voice was completely edited. Realize that if there hadn't been a use of auto-tune (or not as much of it), the song may have been better.

, Black's following single, My Moment used little auto-tune compared to Friday. Possibly because of this, My Moment has a much better ""like/dislike"" ratio on YouTube than ""Friday"".

, My Moment is about the fact that she didn't get discouraged from becoming a singer after all the ""dislikes"" that Friday received. Black states ""this song is for you, haters"". Admire the fact that instead of quitting singing for good, Rebecca Black decided to record another song, showing her determination.

, Don't predetermine that you will hate Black's new music just because you hated Friday. Go in with an open mind and treat it like somebody else's song. Instead of thinking about Friday, think about only her new songs. Realize that Black's music shouldn't be hated just because of it's predecessor.

, Rebecca Black is generally busy writing songs and preparing them for the public.



Person of Interest, which followed My Moment, was another single released by Rebecca Black.

Plug your guitar into your computer.,
Test the signal.",How to Plug a Guitar Into a Laptop1," It is possible to connect your guitar directly to your laptop through the device’s audio-in port. This port is typically located on the side of laptops, near the headphone-out port. You may see one of the following icons next to it: a microphone or a circle with two triangles., While the average guitar cable has a ¼” phone jack on each end, the audio-in port requires a ⅛” stereo plug. You may purchase a guitar cable with a ¼” phone jack on one end and a ⅛” stereo plug on the other end OR you may purchase an ⅛” stereo plug adapter to use with your standard guitar cable.


Your laptop’s audio-in port may require a stereo plug with a TS (Tip/Sleeve) connection or a TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve) connection. If you are unsure which tip your computer requires, consult your laptop’s manual.If your laptop does not have an audio-in port, you will need to purchase an interface or a special cable that plugs into your audio-out port, also known as a headphone jack. These products allow you to use your audio-out port as an audio-in port. These products are sold at a variety of price points and vary in quality. You may also use these devices with your phone and tablet.
If your laptop does not have a headphone jack, you can purchase an adaptor that plugs into your USB port., Insert the ¼” phone jack into your guitar. If you are using a ⅛” stereo adapter, place it over the remaining ¼” phone jack. Insert the ⅛” stereo plug into your laptop’s audio-in port., You can listen to your guitar through your computer’s speakers, a set of external speakers, or a pair of headphones. If you are using external speakers or headphones, insert the speaker cable or headphones into your laptop’s audio-out port. Strum your guitar to test the signal.


If you are using your laptop’s internal speakers or a pair of headphones, you may notice that the signal is relatively weak. This is due to the fact that the laptop’s audio-in port are not capable of amplifying the signal. A set of external speakers, however, will act as an amplifier.You may also experience a significant delay, or a gap between when a sound is inputted into the computer and when you hear that sound.Before you can hear your instrument, you may need to download and/or open recording software.
If you can not hear your guitar, open your computer’s sound settings. Make sure your sound is not muted. Make sure the correct port or device is selected (audio-in, audio-out, headphone, microphone, etc.). For specific instructions, consult your computer or device’s manual."

, Audacity will automatically convert the waveform of the song so that it is reversed and can be listened to backwards. Only the highlighted portion will be reversed — again, if you want to reverse the whole song, you need to select the entire waveform.

, Simply click the ""Play"" button at the top of the window (which looks like a green triangle) in order to hear the portion that you've just reversed.


Note that, by default, only the highlighted portion of a song will play when you hit the play button in Audacity. If none of the song is highlighted, the song will play from the beginning.

, Don't want to download and install any third-party programs on your computer? Use this easy online method instead — all you'll need is a good internet connection and an audio file in the MP3 format. Start by going to mp3-reverser.com.While mp3-reverser.com is quick and easy to use, there are other online programs that can reverse songs for you as well. You can find these with a simple search engine query like ""reverse a song"" or ""reverse an mp3.""
MP3 is a very common audio codec — most songs that you download will already be in this format.

Purchase or find a device with a pre-amp.,
Connect your guitar and pre-amp to your laptop.,
Test the signal.",How to Plug a Guitar Into a Laptop2," If you are unsatisfied with the strength of your guitar’s signal, enhance it with a pre-amp. Pre-amplification is the first stage of amplification. These devices boost your guitar’s signal. You can purchase a pre-amp specifically designed for guitars. However, if you are looking to save money, several guitar accessories come equipped with pre-amps. These include, amp-modelers, pedals, drum machines, and direct boxes.The best pre-amps use tubes.

, Insert your standard guitar cable into your guitar. Plug the other end of the guitar cable into the input port of your pre-amp. Insert a ⅛” stereo in cable into your pre-amp’s PA Out or Line-Out port. Put the opposite end of this cable into your laptop’s audio-in port.If your laptop does not have an audio-in port, you will need to purchase an interface or a special cable that transforms your audio-out port, also known as a headphone jack, into an audio-in port. These products also work with phones and tablets. There are also adapters that plug into USB ports., If your guitar is connected properly to your laptop, you can hear the instrument through your computer’s speakers, a set of external speakers, or a pair of headphones. If you are not using your’ computer’s speakers, insert the external speaker cable or headphones into your laptop’s audio-out port. Strum your guitar to test the signal.While the pre-amp will improve the strength of the signal, it may not decrease any delay you are experiencing. Delay, or audio latency, is the gap that exists between when a sound is inputted into the computer and when that sound is actually heard.In order to hear your guitar, you may need to download and/or open recording software first.
If you are experiencing sound problems, open your computer’s sound settings. Check to see if your sound is muted and that the correct port or device is selected (audio-in, audio-out, headphone, microphone, etc.). For specific instructions, consult your computer or device’s manual."

You can connect your guitar digitally to your computer through a pre-amp with a USB or Firewire outport. Before you purchase a pre-amp with one of these out ports, check to see if the guitar accessories you already own will work. These accessories may include amp-modelers, pedals, drum machines, and direct boxes., Place your standard guitar cable into your guitar. Plug the opposite end of the guitar cable into the pre-amp’s input port. Insert a USB, Firewire, or Optical cable into your pre-amp’s USB or Firewire out port. Plug the other end of this cable into your laptop’s USB or Firewire in port., When your guitar is properly connected, you will be able to assess the strength and quality of your guitar’s signal.

Rip audio from a CD onto a computer to reverse it.,
Modify a turntable for playing vinyl backwards.,
Conversely, turn the record backwards with your hand.,
Re-wind an audio cassette to play it backwards.",How to Play a Song Backwards2," Today, by far the easiest way to listen to a song in reverse is to use a computer (as in the section above.) However, if the song you want to reverse is on a piece of physical media (that is, something you can hold like a CD, cassette, or record), you can still get it to play backwards with a little more work. For instance, if your song is on a CD, most modern computers will give you the option to ""rip"" the audio from your CD, making each track an audio file on your computer (see Listen to a CD Backwards. Once you've done this, you can use one of the methods above to easily reverse the song.


There are many ways to rip the audio from a CD — perhaps the easiest involve using a program like iTunes to do the ripping automatically. It's worth mentioning that if you insert an audio CD into most modern computers, you'll automatically be presented with options for importing the files. Simply click one of these to get started.

, If you want to play a song backwards on a vinyl record, you'll need to make a few changes to your turntable so that you're able to play the record on its underside. Don't worry — none of these changes are permanent and, as long as you're careful, your turntable shouldn't be damaged in any way. Follow the steps below:


Cut a styrofoam cup in half or grab a roll of duct tape. Place it in the center of your turntable around the spindle.
Fix a soda straw to the spindle to extend it.
Remove the headshell from the tone arm, then remove the cartridge. Re-attach the cartridge so that it points up away from the platter, then re-attach the headshell.
Start the record and let the needle rise up into the groove. You may need to adjust the counterweight for this to work.

This video serves as a good visual guide for how to modify your turntable.

, It's also possible to play songs backward on a vinyl record with nothing more than your own hands. Simply set the record player to 0 RPM, then carefully grab the edge of the record and turn it backwards (counter-clockwise) while the speakers are on. You should hear the audio of the song play in reverse.


While this method is easy, it's very difficult to get the same sort of audio quality with this method that you ordinarily would — for instance, it's almost impossible to maintain a consistent speed for any length of time if you're just using your hands to turn the record.

, If the song you want to reverse is on an audio cassette, playing it backwards will involve taking the cassette apart, carefully reversing the internal tape, and re-assembling it. This method requires careful attention to detail to avoid damaging the tape — if you're worried about ruining your songs, you may want to practice a few times on blank cassettes before you try ""for real."" Use the steps below to guide you.Rewind the tape all the way. The full spool should be on your left after rewinding.
Disassemble the plastic case. You will probably need a jeweler's screwdriver for this. Take note of the path the tape takes through the rollers — you will need to replicate it.
Carefully take the tape spools out of the cassette. Do not flip them.

Turn the spools around so that the full spool is on the right. Do this without flipping your spools over — you just want to move the spools while keeping them flat. If you flip the spools over, you'll just be playing side B when you reassemble the cassette.
Mount the spools back in the cassette once again. Carefully thread the tape past all of the rollers so that it is exactly as you first found it. This is important — if the tape doesn't take the same path as before, it can be irreversibly damaged.
Reassemble the cassette and rewind it so that the tape is spooled on the left. You can do this by hand if you're worried about damaging the tape. When you're ready, play the cassette as normal.

Download recording software.,
Learn the basics of the software.,
Invest in an interface.,
Consider getting a microphone.,
Record your first song.,
Add layers to your song.,
Edit the tracks.",How to Make an Album Without a Recording Studio1," There are several options available for recording music. Macs, for instance, come with a full recording suite called Garageband. Go online and research different software and then decide which one is the best fit for you.


Recording software usually offers a free trial period. Download a few of these to test your options.
The industry standards are ProTools and Logic. You can also check out software like Ableton Live, Reason, Fruity Loops, and Audacity.Completely free software like Reaper or Acid are also popular and have similar features to Protools and Logic.;
, Spend a couple weeks experimenting with the software. There are tons of tutorial videos available for free, and many are created by the software company directly.


If you run into trouble and can’t figure something out, google it. State the software’s name and what you’re trying to do. It's often easy to find an answer this way.

, An audio interface allows you to plug in an instrument like a guitar or a microphone, and record onto the computer without a delay in timing. Research an interface that will be the most compatible with your computer and recording needs. Interfaces can have one or multiple input jacks for simultaneous recording. Some larger modules may have up to 16 input jacks and a built in mixer.


Interfaces range greatly in price, so consider your specific needs before committing.
Most interfaces come with a combination of XLR (standard for microphones) and ¼” jacks (standard for guitars and keyboards).
Several interfaces also come with recording software or an extended trial of software. Check out all the features of the prospective interface before purchasing it.

, Be realistic on what you are trying to achieve. Microphones are incredibly useful for a home studio. Even if you plan on making instrumental or electronic music, you can still utilize a microphone for recording. Picking out a microphone is a complex process that varies based on what you want to record.


The most versatile microphone you can record anything with is a condenser microphone. The rule with microphones is that if you want a quality mic, you’ll need to pay at least $100, if not more.
If you want to skip using an interface, invest in an USB microphone. USB microphones plug directly into your computer and are designed not to delay or lag in real time., The best way to start recording a song is to first record an idea in your head. An example of an idea is a drum beat or a funky bass line you keep thinking about. These are launching points for songs. Once you record the foundation of your idea, you’ll be inspired to add different layers to your track.


It’s best to record along to a metronome. You can even setup a click track by using a software drum loop to play along with while recording.

, Continue to experiment with the song until you feel it is complete. The beauty of digital recording is that you are able to add an unlimited number of tracks. Note however that good songwriting and production is often about restraint.


If you have multiple collaborators, choose to have one person play their part with the recording. There is no order that the members should play in, but let them play until they have perfected their part.
You might want to record a phrase of a track at a time, rather than record the whole track in one sitting.

, The best part about recording on your computer is that you can easily edit the material. If you are recording a vocal line and aren’t happy with the chorus, you can splice out the chorus, record the chorus on a new track, and edit the newly recorded chorus to fit in seamlessly.


Whenever you run into a wall with understanding how to do something, research your problem with a search engine.
Editing a song is similar to editing a video, it can make or break the track. Be sure to edit the introduction down to where you want it, and do the same for the ending.
Decide how you want the volume to work in the track. You can edit the song so that it fades in, or adjust the volume so it fades out.

Be aware that there are several variations to this formula.,
Make sure you have a unifying theme.

,
Find an agent and/or publicist and begin to market your album.",How to Make a Great Rock Album," There must always be a connection between your message, your style and public expectations. In short, you need to find your own secret formula.;
, This is an example of how a 12-song rock album might be organized, but don't feel afraid to branch-out, just don't lose continuity:


Hard Rock Song 1 - Song to Set the Tone of the Album. (But this doesn't have to be in the exact ""Hard Rock"" style. A good example of ""pumping up"" the listener, but no using this exact format is AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"" from the Razors Edge album.)
Power Rock Song 1 - Fast and Catchy. Potential Album Single. (Led Zeppelin's ""Rock 'n' Roll"" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example)
Moody Rock Song 1 - Slow Down to Allow Last Song to Resonate.
Power Rock Song 2 - Lift the Album's Speed Back Up Again. (Led Zeppelin's ""Misty Mountain Hop"" from Led Zeppelin Four is a good example)
Hard Rock Song 2 - Medium Paced Song to Allow the Album to Flow.
Dark Song 1 - Something to Catch the Listener Off Guard.
Transitional Song - Almost Like a Second Introduction.
Hard Rock Song 3 - Real Meat of the Album. Fewer ""Hooks.""
Dark Song 2 - Dark Concept Songs Generally Work Better Later On.
Hard Rock Song 4 - Substance With Little Gimmick. Purer Song.
Power Song 3 - One Last Heavier Song to Complete the Album.
Closing Rock Song - Usually Carries an ""Ending"" Theme With It.

, Most artists will place their 1st album single at the beginning of an album while others will place it anywhere up to the 5th track slot. This list simply outlines the general industry standard called ""Front Loading."" This is where the album has a decisive flow with it's content perfectly streaming along the first half of the album. Most times the first half of the album holds many key songs in order to make the album sell. The second half of the album is generally there for the artists and true fans of the artist. Hence, the second half of the album is created to be almost a second chapter to the record.

Pick out a decent recorder.,
Purchase a microphone.,
Experiment with the recorder.,
Record your first track.,
Add layers to your song.",How to Make an Album Without a Recording Studio2," The home recording staple is the four-track (sometimes called digital multitrack recorders). You can still buy an analog four track that records onto a regular cassette tape, but these are harder to find in working condition. You can also invest in a higher quality reel to reel tape recorder.


One of the most popular brands for home recording multitrack systems is Tascam.Four track recorders are machines designed to record four tracks on either a memory card or tape. With the four track, you can record four live takes at once, or layer up to four tracks on top of one another.
You can alternatively purchase an eight track recorder for more multitrack recording possibilities.

, You will need a microphone for a multitrack recorder. The best type of microphone to get for a variety of purposes is a condenser microphone. You can alternatively get a couple of high or low quality dynamic microphones. Choosing a microphone is a complex process that depends on your recording goals and budget.


Multiple microphones will be better to record multiple tracks with your recorder. You can add more parts with more musicians by using multiple microphones.

, Read the manual or start experimenting with your recorder. Think of how the effects on the recorder can be used in your songs and remember any notable qualities of the recorder. Several multitrack recorder have the capability to bounce tracks. Bouncing tracks combines two or more recorded tracks into one track.


Make a few silly demos while you are starting to understand how to use the device. You never know what you may like and what to add to the album.
Bouncing tracks reduces the sound quality, so be wary bouncing too many tracks.

, The best way to start recording a song is to first record an idea in your head. An example of an idea is a drum beat or a funky bass line you keep thinking about. These are launching points for songs. Once you record the foundation of your idea, you’ll be inspired to add different layers to your track.


Choose a song to begin with and have the whole band record at the same time. It does not matter if it sounds bad as long as there is a steady beat and a feel for the song., If you are using a tape recorder, you need to plan out the design of the song in advance. Digital recording is much more forgiving than analog recording. The best way to utilize a tape recorder is with multiple microphones and a mixer. With a mixer you can perform a live set and mix it into one track. Then you can use the remaining tracks for overdubs.


For example, set up multiple microphones to record the guitar, bass, and drums. Send those mics through the mixer and into one track of your four track. Then you can spend three additional tracks on vocals, lead guitar, and any other layers you want to add.

"
"
Mix the song.,
Add production effects.,
Master the album.,
Make a demo of the album.,
Design a cover.",How to Make an Album Without a Recording Studio3," Mixing is the process of affecting parts of a single track and the overall master track. You can edit the high, low, and mid frequency range for each track. Once the tracks sound good together, experiment with panning the tracks to the left or right. Panning is a good way to isolate a track and blend it in with other tracks.


Most multitrack recorders come equipped with an equalizer (EQ).
Mixing can help accent parts you want to be more present, or even hide parts you're not thrilled about.
Equalize each track and balance everyone. Low sounds should be the strongest for a good balance.
For inspiration listen to the Beatles with headphones. They only had a four track recorder and you can hear multiple complex parts interacting and balancing each other out.

, Once you record your album, you can add certain effects that will improve the sound of the album. Popular post-production effects are compression and reverb. Compression squeezes the track together, lessening the dynamic range between the loud and quiet parts of the song.As compression brings elements of the sound together, reverb redistributes the sound to fill a space. Reverb widens the sound wave by stimulating the sound bouncing off multiple surfaces.

, Mastering is a compression technique used in post-production to ensure every song is equal in volume. You also strive to achieve an equal balance in each speaker. Mastering is not an easy process and may require a more experienced engineer.


Some music software programs come equipped with a simple form of mastering.
Record labels will typically have their own engineer to master an album they plan on releasing.
There are different techniques for mastering, depending on the form you release your album (vinyl, CD, cassette, or stream).

, Burn the CD through the recorder or computer and give it a listen. If it does not sound good in a stereo system or headphones, decide if you want to record certain songs again.


Pass a few copies of the demo out to trusted friends and fellow musicians. Ask them for constructive feedback on the album to determine if the songs are working., Create album art and make the album look good. You can create an image using a design software like Photoshop or Illustrator. Another option you could do is to use a photo of something.


Look at your favorite album covers to decide if you want to pay an artist to do something special like Santana's album Abraxas.
Then there are famous album covers that are nothing but a picture like The Beatles' Abbey Road.

"
"
Make sure you have enough songs to make an album.,
Try to use only the ones you think are the best, if your songs are long.,
Try to mix different sounds.,
Start creating.,
Add a cover in between the record to make it more attractive to people.

,
Remember: you can change this formula to fit your desires as a musician.",How to Make a Great Metal Album," 8 - 12 would do just fine.;
, 12 songs lasting over 7 minutes each would make the album kind of boring. A normal album lasts from 45 to 60 minutes.

, For example, 7 medium-paced songs, 2 thrash-metal songs and 1 or 2 ballads would make a good album. Think of albums like The Number of the Beast - Iron Maiden or ...And Justice for All - Metallica.


You might notice that most of the structure shown later is based on a common Metallica album. It is true, because Metallica albums are full with different styles that make a long album flow perfect and harmonically.

, This is an example of what a ""mixed sounds"" albums would look like. You can obviously arrange the order of the songs or have more of one style than other:


Introduction: (Optional) This could be any 1-2 minute instrumental, either slow or heavy. Used to set up the mood for the album. Think of Dialectic Chaos by Megadeth or The Ides of March by Iron Maiden.
Fast Song: You can start with a heavy riffed, thrashy song that transmits energy to the whole album. Possible single. Think of Judas Priest's Painkiller or Slayer's Angel of Death.
Power Song: This song can be medium-fast paced, with heavy riffs and kind of marching drum beats, catchy lyrics. Possible single. Think of For Whom the Bell Tolls - Metallica or The Prisoner - Iron Maiden.
Moody Song: This song is ""freestyle"" in terms of speed and riffs, but it must carry the same mood from the album, a catchy element like a repetitive chorus or a great guitar solo would fit perfectly on this song. Think of F***ing Hostile by Pantera or Beauty Through Order by Slayer.
Ballad: This song is optional if your genre is heavier, like Slayer or Death or Black Metal. This can be a potential single because it can be more suitable for people who don't like Metal. Clean guitars and slow beats would do. Most of the times they have multiple guitar solos, commonly slow solos, but you can throw a face-melting solo like Metallica's One or Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven. You can alternate between heavy and slow parts of the song like Pantera's Cemetery Gates.
Power Song 2: This song is to lift up the mood of the album, after a ballad it is recommended to use a medium paced song, or something between a ballad and a power song to continue going through the same mood. Melodic Metal songs would fit better because of the constant harmony sections used in the songs. Think of Prowler (Iron Maiden) or if you're going heavier, Gears of War (Megadeth).
Moody Song 2/Dark Song: With Dark we mean a song that is written in a minor scale, or if you play in an alternate tuning like CGCFAD or Eb. This can be medium paced, with the same mood of the album. Possible single. Think of Metallica's Harvester of Sorrow for Dark Songs or AC/DC's Back in Black for a Moody Song.
Power Song 3: Heavy song, same mood from the album. Think of newer music like Evile's Metamorphosis or Trivium's Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven.
Instrumental: This is completely optional, but if you'd like to show your skills as a band, you can include an instrumental, that acts as a ""bridge"". It can be of 2 minutes, or it can be going from 5 to 7 or even 9 minutes, depending on how much you want to show your skills. Some of them are used by Opeth, that used for example a bridge song called ""Requiem"" in their Orchid album, or ""Patterns in The Ivy"" from their Blackwater Park album. This is a common Metallica fixture too, with songs like To Live is To Die, Call of Ktulu or Orion, but also newer bands like Evile's Hundred Wrathful Deities, clocking at 11:16.
This can be the last song for the album, you can either go for a Power Song or an ending Fast Paced song. For Power Songs think of One Shot at Glory - Judas Priest. For Fast Songs think of Metallica songs like Damage Inc. or Dyers Eve. If you choose not to end the album with these songs, you can continue with the one below.
Ending Song: This last song can be a slow, long song that carries an ending theme or either a song following the mood of the album, written in the shape of a Moody Song. It can variate a lot, depending on the theme your album is about. You can see a lot of examples: Megadeth's Rust In Peace... Polaris, In Flames' End of Things, Guns N' Roses' Rocket Queen, Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss, etc.

,,


You can go straight with a single genre like Slayer's Reign in Blood, that goes at around 230BPM the whole album, so this is up to you.
Lyrically, your record can be about whatever you want. But if your album is a concept album, you can use the first song to tell the beginning of the story and the ending to finish it. Make sure you do it directly, unless you are planning a continuation of this album.

Take a look at what you've written.,
Think hard: would it make sense to take a line from the chorus and use it as the title, or does the song deserve something more creative?,
Find the proper wording for this emotion.,
Once you settle on a phrase or word that perfectly describes everything you, the narrator of the song and the listener would experience through the song, you have your title.

,
Also think about what made you write the song in the first place.,
Lastly, see if there is a specific recipient to which you want to dedicate the song.",How to Name a Song You've Written," Without having a general overview of what you have really done, you can't hope to synopsize it properly with a title.;
, Think about what the song is saying from the perspective of the narrator, or what a listener would say the song is about. Try to draw a connection to both the narrator and listener: a common emotion that both may experience.

, Sometimes, this is best to sleep on for a night or two.

,, If the source of your creation is an object or even a person, you can't be wrong to include references to the object or person in the name.

, You should think about what the person would like and what kind of feelings or thoughts would the name you have come up with stir up in their mind. In that way the name does not necessarily have to connect to the content very closely.

Decide what type of dance/electronic music you would prefer.,
Start to learn classic electronic music sounds.,
Search for inspiration.",How to Make Dance Music1," Listen to a large variety of music until you find the sound or style that speaks to you. The most popular types of dance music currently are commercial Dance, Trance, House, Drum and Bass, Garage, Hip Hop, and UK/Happy Hardcore, although there are many more. There are also other totally different types of sub-genres to dance.


Consider the purpose of your dance music. Is it for a specific event, a class, or just for fun? Take this into consideration. For example, if you're making some dance music for a party you're having in a few weeks you'll want the music to be more upbeat.
Don't limit yourself by genres and pop charts. Look for new artists and experiment!;
, There are some classic, legendary electronic music sounds that make their way into most songs. The TR-808, TR-909, TR-606, and LinnDrum are all sounds that are worth becoming very comfortable with. It’s not so different from familiarizing yourself with the basics chords if you were trying to learn guitar. Once you begin to understand the textures to these sounds the rest of your music making experience will be a lot easier., If you want to make dance music you probably already have listened to a good deal of it. Start by emulating the music that you like. Some recommend taking someone else’s track to get started.


By no means should you ever copy someone’s work and claim it as your own. However, if you’re just trying to learn and build confidence it is very helpful to take the framework of a song that you enjoy and make alterations. "

Sing the song with memory aids.,
Sing along with the recording.,
Sing without the recording.",How to Memorize a Song," It’s difficult to memorize a song if you don’t know what it’s supposed to sound like. These days, you can download most songs off the internet from companies such as iTunes or Amazon. Concentrate completely on the song as you listen to it, so you can absorb the lyrics and melody.It’s best to listen to the song with headphones because you’re be better able to block out distractions and listen more closely.
If you’re learning an original song that a friend, classmate, or acquaintance has written, ask them for a recording of it. If they don’t have one ready, have them perform the song for you and use your phone to record it.;
, Even when you’re listening to the song, you may not always get the words right, so it’s important to verify that you know what the correct lyrics are. Buying the sheet music for the song or asking the composer for the official lyrics if it’s an original piece is the best way to go. However, you can also find the lyrics for virtually all songs online, but be careful with sites that provide user-generated content -- the lyrics may not be accurate.After you’ve studied the lyrics for a while, it’s a good idea to read along with them as you listen to the song. That can help you really start to understand how the song’s melody works in conjunction with the lyrics.

, Once you’ve listened to the song and studied the lyrics, it helps to break down the song into its components, such as the intro, verses, chorus, and bridges. Listen to the song again, and on your copy of the lyrics, label each section so you understand how the entire arrangement flows.Once you’ve mapped out the song, listen to it again with your notes. That way, you can make a connection in your mind with the lyrics that correspond to each part of the song.

, Before you start worrying about memorizing the lyrics, it’s important to get the tune of the song down. In many cases, the melody can actually help remind you of what the next words in the song are. If you can read music, you can study the sheet music to identify the notes that comprise the melody. Otherwise, listen to your recording of the song to hear how the vocalist sings the melody.When you’re first singing the melody, you don’t have to use the correct lyrics. It’s often easier to just use “La” for each word until you’ve got the melody down.

, In many cases, it’s easier to memorize lyrics when you understand the song’s meaning. That’s because you can start to visualize certain parts of the song, and the images that you come up with may help you remember key phrases or lines. If you’re having trouble understanding the song, websites such as SongMeanings.com and SongFacts.com offer analysis of many popular songs.You may want to search online for articles where the writer or composer of the song discussed its meaning. The song’s creator is the best source for that information.
If there are words that you don’t understand in the lyrics, look them up in the dictionary. It’s often difficult to remember words if you don’t know what they mean.

, When you’re ready to sit down and learn the song, it helps to work on it in separate parts, so you’re not overwhelmed by the process. For example, you might start with the first verse and move onto the next verse once you’ve gotten that part down. The chorus is often a good place to start, though, because it typically recurs throughout the song, so you’ll have memorized a larger percentage of the song if you learn it first.It’s often a good idea to start with the most difficult section of the song. Whether it’s second verse that has a lot of wordy lines or the chorus which moves very quickly, memorizing the toughest part will usually require the most work, so it’s best to get it over with first.

, When you first start trying to sing the song from memory, you may have trouble coming up with all of the words. Try to work your way through using aids that can help jog your memory, such as flashcards. They’ll allow you to recall the words on your own, but provide support if you get stuck.Create flashcards that feature the first few words of each section of the song, such as the first verse, the chorus, and the bridge. Run through the cards, coming up with the rest of the lyrics for each section until you can sing the entire song without them.
If you want to challenge yourself to come up with all of the words on your own, try drawing pictures on the flashcards that depict specific sections of the song to help you remember the lyrics.
Acting out the song as you sing it can be another helpful memory aid. Make an effort to link specific lyrics to certain hand gestures or even dance moves that will help remember the words without having to look at your lyric sheet., When you feel like you have a good grasp of the lyrics, it’s time to start practice singing along with your recording. You’ll have the original vocalist to help you along in case you have trouble remembering any parts, so you can build confidence with the song.You should begin practicing along with the recording a day or so after you first start learning the song. You can have the lyrics or flashcards in front of you for quick glances, but try not to rely on them to remember the words.
A day after you first practice singing along with the recording, do it again, but this time, don't have the lyrics on hand. Instead, use your memory to come up with the words., Once you can sing along with the recording without making any mistakes, it’s time to take away that safety net, and practice singing by yourself. In the beginning, it helps to have musical accompaniment to provide cues to help you along. However, you should eventually get to the point where you can sing the entire song without the recording or a back-up instruments because not every band that you work with may perform the song in the exact same way.Start singing without the recording approximately a day after you successfully sing along to the recording without the lyrics. The first time you do it, you don't necessarily have to be perfect -- you can just sing through the lyrics without any music, taking time to ensure that they're correct.
Practice singing the song on your own every 24 to 36 hours to help improve your chances of memorizing it. You'll want to do this for several days until you're successfully singing the song all the way through. Once you've memorized the entire song, you can practice just once or twice a week.If you make a mistake when you’re singing, stop the recording and figure out your mistake. Start the song over, continuing to work on any weak sections until you can get through the entire piece without issue.
If you don’t have a band or musician to play the song with you, look for a Karaoke version of the song that you can practice with.
When you’re singing without any musical backup, it’s a good idea to have a metronome on hand to help you keep the beat. That way, you’ll know that you’re not rushing or slowing down the song too much.

Add lyrics if you choose to.",How to Make Dance Music2," If you’re just getting started you can play around with something like Garage Band, but as you get serious you’ll want to invest in a program that has a vast library of high quality recorded sounds.


You also want a program that will make your life easier as you proceed with your arrangement. Ableton Live and Bitwig are two popular options.

, The beat powers the song and controls how danceable the music is. To form a good beat, try to pick out just the drums from a piece of dance music. Dance music is almost always in 4/4 time, but there are exceptions, such as ""Galvanize"" by The Chemical Brothers in which they throw in a 2/4 bar every few instrumental measures.


High hat sounds good with straight eighth notes or sixteenths. You can use snare drum to accent and syncopate the beat. Hip-hop uses the clap, so you may want to try to use electronic snare instead., Rather than choosing just one prerecorded drum sound, try laying two different ones over each other. This will create a new and unique sound that you can add to your music. The sounds blend together so if you really like the attack of one beat but prefer the body of a different beat you can combine the two.The attack is the very beginning of a drum beat.

, Dance music usually starts with the catchy bassline and elaborates based on repetition.The bassline can also be the rhythm of a chord progression that you make. The bassline does not necessarily need to have a bass playing it, but you should choose an instrument that has a lower tone. These lower tones sound good when they are establishing the rhythm.

, Trust your ear – there’s no exact way to do this. Understanding the sounds that work well together is an art. Don’t throw sounds together that immediately sound dissonant and expect them to sound better later on down the road. If it doesn’t work, ditch it.


Choosing the right sounds at the beginning is much more important than tweaking levels later on. Pick something that gels right away. Otherwise you may end up rebuilding your track from the ground up later., Most dance music has a typical structure. This structure is Intro, Verse, Chorus, Breakdown, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, and then Outro. The Breakdown generally ditches percussion as you transfer from the first chorus to the second verse and the Bridge is another transitional section popular in pop music.Consider the arc you want your song to have. Do you want an interlude, a big drop, or a build up? Try charting our how you want your song to sound on a piece of paper before you start building it.

, Generally the farther you progress in the song the more action there should be. Usually some layers are rhythms on the chord progression, others are the same note or riff played over and over despite the progression.

, You may want to rap or make two lines that rhyme and sound cool to repeat in certain parts of the song.Alternatively, you could go for a rock format with a verse and a chorus. You can even take out your favorite poem or nursery rhyme and read or sing it! It's up to you.


Some sort of rhythmic phrase can add a whole new component to your dance music.

Try it out!",How to Make Dance Music3," If something doesn't sound right then it is up to you to figure out why it doesn't sound right.All music is based upon experimentation and the same theory used over 400 years ago. The reason to study theory is to learn about what musicians of the past discovered by themselves.

, It’s important that you attend to each specific sound. You don’t want your music to end up sounding like one big wall of noise. Sometimes light rebalancing is enough to completely change the sound of your song. Understand that each individual element is very important to the overall structure., Don’t only take the prerecorded sounds from the program that you are using. You should always be on the search for new sounds to spice up your music.Use the internet to find websites that offer sounds – there are tons of them out there, and you can even find a few that offer the sounds for free if you look hard enough.


You can also pull from the sounds on other programs. If you stick with the sounds on your program for too long your music will become stagnant and repetitive.

, It’s important that you continue to search for new sounds. The more creative your sounds are, the less stale your music will feel. You want something that people can dance too, but you also want to stand out from the crowd., You can take out the drums and bass to leave a string riff or you can have a beat play alone. You can even change styles completely. However, many think the most important thing to pay attention to is the kick drum.If you feel like your music isn’t gelling or just hasn’t come together yet, the kick might be the problem. This is the heart of your song. If your mix isn’t coming together, change the kick drum sound or rhythm.

, Get some friends together, have some drinks, and check out the danceability of your new track. Your friends will probably be excited to hear your new music and you'll get to see which parts of the song people seem most into. This is a great way to have some fun and hear a few critiques at the same time.

Remember that punk music is defined as being yourself.",How to Make a Good Punk Song," Punk music can be about almost anything: a relationship that’s soured, politics, your feelings towards something in general, or just something completely random.


If you write a song about your feelings towards something, make sure it stays “punk” and not ‘emo’. Emo is short for emotive punk rock, and is actually an offshoot of punk. We're trying to write punk here, not an offshoot of punk.;
, Make your lyrics match they style of punk you are playing (but remember that within all these styles there are variants).


Hardcore should be shouted with just a couple phrases repeated, about politics or something relevant.
Psychobilly/horror-punk should be about B movies or killing.
77 punk or post punk can be about love or pretty much anything.

, Most punk songs use rhyme a lot. If you can't come up with a perfect rhyme (as in: seedy / needy / greedy), try using imperfect rhymes. There are two main types:


The vowel sounds of the words are the same (e.g. subtle/bubble)
The consonant sounds are the same (e.g. middle/muddle)
To make words rhyme, you can also try using an alternate pronunciation. To make “more” and “sure”rhyme, for example, you could pronounce “sure” as “shore”.

, Try stressing different syllables on different beats.

, Most punk music is fast and uses only 3 or 4 chords. Your guitar needs to be fast and catchy, with distortion up high. The chords ‘A’, ‘E’, ‘D’, and ‘B’ are a good place to start.


Be creative and add minor chords to make it stand out. Feedback is good.

, Throwing in a few snares also gives it a good sound.

,, Your song title can be a line from the chorus or about the overall theme you are trying to get across. You could also go and try to make a name that is ridiculously long and relates to the song in someway. A song can also have a random name that has nothing to do with the song, but this is not a great idea unless the name is catchy.

, So, if you follow this guide to the letter, your song will not be ‘punk’.

Trim your lyrics to suit the music.",How to Learn to Write Songs," As a musician, an instrument is a way to express yourself. As a songwriter however, it's more of a tool. A songwriter will use an instrument to play out his ideas and hear how they sound to the human ear. Of course, as a prospective songwriter, this means you should at least know how to play the basics of an instrument. While advanced skill in one or more instruments will make it easier to handle some of the technical aspects of songwriting, most music can be written with simple chords and scales.


A guitar or a keyboard are the best instruments to use when writing music.They're the most versatile, and can serve as both a rhythm and lead instrument.;
, Music lessons are a good way to pick up skills fast from a master of the craft. You can avoid picking up bad habits with a given instrument, and getting proper directions for your practice is a great way to stay motivated. In addition, most teachers for a given instrument will have experience in writing music of their own. They can offer you specific advice with each step of writing songs of your own.


If you want a private music instructor, you should check in the local newspaper in the classifieds as well as online ad sites like Craigslist and Kijiji. Professional music instructors post their availability and specialty in these ads. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find several and choose the one you think is best for you.
Most universities and high schools offer courses in music. Even if you only join the school band to play standard tunes, the experience you gain will carry over into everything you write later on.

, Put on a few of the top hits featured on the Billboard Hot 100.Listen to these songs for the use of melody, rhythm, song structure and lyrical content. Regardless whether you enjoy the finished product or not, decide for yourself which things work or don't work.


Don't worry much about genre. A song is a song, and genre usually comes through in the way the music is played. Even so, if you have a certain type of music you would like to write in, you can analyze some of the hits of that genre if you choose. Keep in mind however that all genres will have something to potentially offer you as a songwriter. Keep an open mind.
Keep in mind that a lot of the big hits you hear on the radio sound so sharp because of the tens of thousands of dollars that have been invested into the production. While you're listening, you should try to listen for the basic writing tricks and structure.

, For a nominal fee, you can join in and take part in a guided discussion where the songwriter will show you his tricks of the trade. While the worth of the workshop ultimately depends on the writer hosting it, it can be inspiring to convene directly with someone who does what you want to do for a living. As an added bonus, you'll also meet lots of other prospective writers. This can be good for social networking and potential writing collaborations in the future.

, You can compensate for your lesser skills by teaming up with another person who excels in the places you do not. Writing with another person can be an immensely inspiring process, as the ideas you think up will have an immediate audience, regardless whether they're actually used in the finished product or not.


Some of the most successful songwriting has happened as a pair. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have written all of the former's best-known songs, and take care of the music and lyrics respectively on their own., Music theory seeks to translate music into the more rigid language of a science. Although music theory cannot be relied on solely for songwriting, it's generally underrated by musicians who want quick success with their art. By understanding the technical elements of music, you'll have much better intuition of what notes sound best together. Music theory primer textbooks can be purchased at most music shops and bookstores.


Notation is an important part of theory. It is essentially how composers write down music. All things from rhythm, speed (tempo), pitch, harmony and volume are covered in notation.
Time signatures are vital for an understanding of music theory. If you read up on time signatures, you'll have an easier time writing sophisticated rhythms.
Scales are sequences of notes that sound right together. Chords are combinations of different notes. You'll be learning a lot of both in music theory.

, A lot of the music you create is going to be a product of the music you've enjoyed the most in your life. Keeping this fact in mind, you can kickstart your own creative inspiration by taking an hour aside to sit down and intently digest one of your favourite albums. Even if you've heard it a hundred times before, you'll approach it in a different way if you have your own songwriting on the mind. Keep an ear out for tricks the musicians use to get their feelings across.


Don't worry too much about being a copycat or plagiarizing. Although you should want to be seen as an original artist, there's never such a thing as true originality. The best artists will allow their music to be influenced by the music that's excited them the most, then let their personality fill in the blank spaces for a unique piece of music.

, Many of the best songs revolve around personal life experiences on the part of the person who wrote it. If you're suffering a case of writer's block and the act of songwriting isn't coming naturally to you, you should sit down for a bit and think about some of the life events that have most shaped you as a person. Love, loss, death and everyday life are common topics for pop songs. If you look hard enough, you'll find interesting stories that have popped up in your life.


Even something mundane, like going to get ice cream, can be turned into a poignant song if it's written with enough wit. Starting out however, it's recommended you stick with easier, more important topics.
Don't just consider the experiences; consider the way they made you feel as well. For example, a break-up may be usually seen as a negative thing or a source of heartbreak, but you can end up seeing it as a good thing if that break-up led you to finding the partner of your dreams. This ironic feeling could make a solid basis for a good song.

, Lyrics are the opportunity for a songwriter to give a specific indication what the song is supposed to be about. Lyrics will stick in a listeners head as much as the music in some cases, and the importance of having good lyrics cannot be underrated. Before you even sit down to write lyrics of your own, you should keep your ear open for great lyrics while you listen. Listen to the Beatles' Yesterday or the Beach Boys' Surf's Up and analyze the way the songwriters use wordplay, rhyme, metaphor and timing.

, If you're ever feeling down or frustrated that the creativity isn't coming to you, going for a walk is a great idea. Getting outside and putting your body in motion will help encourage creative thought. If you end up walking for long enough, you might hear or see something that sparks a new surge of inspiration.

, If we're lazy as artists, it may be because we are lazy s consumers of art. You are recommended to check out a wide range of music if you want to succeed as a songwriter. The music we listen to is often the main contributor to your own songs. Listening to new genres of music will flood your brain with fresh stimulation. If you hear something that inspires you in a new way, it could be the start for a new line of inspiration.

, Ironically, when you're more easily distracted, it may be easier to focus on making something artistic. If you're generally a morning person, try working on making music at night instead. The vice-versa works if you're a night person. t may not seem as intuitive to be working on something when you're at less than your best, but it may help you approach your would-be material from a fresher lens.

, If you know how to play an instrument, you should become comfortable with playing your instrument ""just because"". If you're noodling on an instrument without imposing any strict goals, you'll allow yourself to relax and let the creative side out to play. Even if you're not trying to write songs explicitly, you might end up coming up with some of your best ideas through casual experimentation.


Jamming is best when you have a friend to bounce ideas back and forth from.

, When it comes time to get serious about writing your music, you could still do with guidance. Coming up with a concrete structure can be helpful in order to learn the ropes of songwriting. Write out the parts of a potential song on a piece of paper. To begin with, you could even listen to a great song you already love, and copy the structural skeleton. Here are the basic pieces of a song you might be working with:


The intro. The intro is the first bit of a song that introduces the listener to the tone, leading into the verse.
The verse. Verses are the body of a song, focused around the lyrics. This is where you tell your story.
The chorus. The chorus is the ""biggest"" part of the song, where the catchiest melody is repeated. The same chorus is repeated several times between verses, although some changes to the chorus can happen by the song's end.
The bridge. A bridge isn't always in a song, but it's essentially a break away from the typical verse-chorus structure, usually two thirds into a song. This offers a bit of a surprise to the listener, and it serves as a wakeup call to anyone who thought like they had already figured your song out.
You may want to come up with a song title before even getting to the music itself. Generally speaking, a title should grab your attention in a few words or less., Creativity is tricky because it never comes when it's convenient. Some of your best creative ideas will emerge when you're far away from an instrument. In this instance, you should record yourself humming the melody or tapping out the rhythm.

, Instead of playing out a song with a live instrument, you can input the notes and textures into a computer program that will play your vision out for you. This is very helpful because it gives you a chance to hear how sounds combine with one another.

, One common way of doing this is by having two vocal parts sing different pitches at the same time. Properly adding harmonies to your music requires some knowledge of music theory, but it's easy to do once you get the proper hang of it.

, If you're still learning the process of songwriting, it's important to note that the songwriting process is never truly over unless you choose to set it in stone. If you're playing your song and think something might sound better done differently, go ahead with it. Better yet, play your ideas out for someone and see what he thinks. The more versions of a song you crank out the closer you'll get to something you're truly happy with.

, A lyric journal is a good way of keeping your creative ideas flowing. Keep a book of lined paper in your pocket. If you end up thinking of an interesting lyrical image or observation about life, write it down. Even if you don't even end up using a lot of the stuff you write down, it will put your brain into a mindset where you'll find yourself inspired more of the time.

, Depending on your existing skill as a wordsmith, your initial mileage may vary. As you're still just learning how to write songs however, you shouldn't be worried about creating poignant ideas from the start. Take a lined sheet of paper and write as many images as you can think of that relate to the same mood. For example, feeling sad could bring to mind a rainy day, or a lone snowman melting in the sun.


Using poetic devices in your lyrics is a key part of impressing your listeners.Metaphors, alliteration and similes can be a major benefit to your song, so long as you don't overuse or force them in.

, Without a proper knowledge of lyrics, new lyric writers will use a lot of the most overused metaphors everyone else has gotten sick of. Do your best to be less obvious with your feelings. Make your lyrics more specific to your own situation.


The same issues apply to rhyming. Rhyme schemes are important in songwriting, but you shouldn't be writing a song purely to match it. Meaning is ultimately more important than any sort of poetic device.

, If you've been keeping up to date with a lyric journal or lyric exercises like an imagery brainstorm, you should amass a considerable amount of ideas in relatively short time. From there, it's time to combine these ideas into something more substantial. Take your ideas and try to pair lines up with others that seem to have a lot in common tone wise. From there, you should modify them to be more consistent.

, With the majority of songs, the music should ultimately take the precedent over your lyrics. Lyrics can be written without s much regard for the metre and timing until they're fused with the music. The music (especially the verse section) will determine how many syllables you're allowed to fit. As you're trying to combine the two, it may take several runs-through before you start getting lyrics that sound like they match the song. Take care not to rob the lyrics of their meaning by cutting them down too much however. A great idea can be evoked in as few words as possible with the right inspiration.

If you want to be an R&B singer, listen to some records by the iconic artists in the field.Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are all legendary R&B singers.
If you want to listen to something slightly more modern, try Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, or John Legend.;
, There is really no secret to becoming successful in any art. It simply takes a lot of practice. If you want to become a good R&B singer, you need to make time each day to practice.Find a chunk of time when you can work in practice time. Think about a time of day where you're not usually busy. Do you find you frequently have free time after dinner? If so, you could set aside an hour of practice then.
When you're first starting out, simply try to hit the right notes and remember your lyrics. As you continue to practice, you can try things like adding variation to songs, putting emotion in your voice, and incorporating riffs.

, Most R&B artists are able to convey emotion in their voice. If you want to be a good R&B singer, work on making your singing emotionally resonate.Think about the emotion behind the song you're singing. Is the song happy? Is it sad? Melancholy? Anxious? Try to convey this emotion with your voice.
It can be hard to figure out how to sing with emotion, especially if you've never tried before. One simple trick is to change your expression when you sing. If you adopt, say, a sad appearance, your voice may naturally sound sadder. Conversely, you can smile to make a song sound sadder.
Also, try to think thoughts that produce the emotion you're feeling. For example, if you're singing a sad song, try to remember moments in your life when you felt sad.

, Master a few classics before you move on to original or newer material. Learning to sing a few standards will help teach you the basics of R&B singing.Try to learn a few simple jazz classics. Sing songs like ""God Bless This Child"" by Billie Holiday, ""Summertime"" by Ella Fitzgerald, and ""Mistry"" by Errol Garner.
You can also try some more contemporary R&B songs. For example, try ""One Sweet Day"" by Mariah Carey, ""Fallin"" by Alicia Keys, and ""Unbreak my Heart"" by Toni Braxton.

, You will do a better job singing a song that speaks to you personally. You should understand the lyrics of a variety of R&B standards. Select songs for your repertoire that you can relate to. This can make your renditions more meaningful.You can read lyrics to R&B songs online. Read one line at a time and pause to consider what the artist means. Are they singing about heartbreak, loss, love, triumph?
Choose a song you can relate to. If you've just gone through heartbreak yourself, you can pick a song about the loss of love. If you've overcome a difficulty in your life, pick a song about triumphing over adversity.
Keep in mind, you can try to write your own lyrics and set them to music. Start off by writing an emotional poem that speaks to you personally. From there, try to find a beat and rhythm to go with your poem.

, Vocal riffs are embellishments added by a singer during a song. These are extra melodic notes meant to enhance a certain moment or line in a song. Many R&B singers add riffs to their songs, so you should practice adding your own as you sing.Listen for riffs when you play R&B records. Try to figure out when and where they're most effective. You may notice many R&B singers use the same riffs over and over again. You usually only need a few good riffs, which you can incorporate into a variety of songs.
You can try to add riffs at a moment in a song you want to emphasize. For example, you can add a few riffs during the emotional highlight of the song, or a moment that you find particularly poignant.
Make sure not to overdo it with riffs. If you had several long riffs in a song, or add riffs too often, you may sound like you're parodying R&B music.

, Many R&B singers alter the lyrics of songs as they sing. Singers may even embellish or change the lyrics in their own songs. Embellishment can help you hone your style as an R&B singer. However, you need to know when embellishment is and is not appropriate.You should never embellish the first few lyrics of a song You want to make sure your audience recognizes the song, so sing the first lyrics as they were originally written.
You can start to embellish when you hit the second verse. You may want to alter the lyrics slightly to suit your mood. You can also change the melody slightly. For example, you could sing a traditionally high note a little lower.

, This is important to be successful in any kind of singing. R&B singing is no exception. Record yourself singing your song and then play it back to yourself. See where you can improve.You do not need fancy recording equipment. Most cell phones will be efficient. Keep your face about 5 inches from your phone when you record. Record in a quiet environment.
Be a tough critic. Figure out which notes you need to hit better. Think about whether your singing is emotionally resonate enough. Consider whether you need to better remember your lyrics.

, If you've never sung before, professional voice lessons can help. It can be difficult to evaluate your own voice, as the sound you hear is slightly different than what others hear.A voice teacher can give you more objective feedback.


You can find a voice teacher online. You can also look in your local yellow pages, or ask other signers you know.
If you can't afford voice lessons, you may be able to find cheap or free lessons online.

, If you would like to record your songs seriously, see if you can find a producer willing to work with you. You may have to pay a fee, but a good producer is vital to a successful R&B singer.You don't have to break the bank finding a producer. Go on YouTube and SoundCloud and listen to independent artists. Contact the producer and ask if he or she would work with you. If you have any recordings of yourself, you can send these to them.
You may be able to get produced long distance. If you send producers your recordings, they can tweak them for you to improve the sound.

, You want to build your skill by performing in front of an audience. Look for opportunities to sing in your area. Sign up for local talent shows. Sing at karaoke night. Sing at a local charity, fair, or festival. Any chance you have to see how others respond to your singing is a great way to improve your voice and performance.

Stretch your tongue out and say “Ahh” a few times to warm up your tongue before starting to sing.;
, Your singing breath comes from a different place than your regular breath does. Concentrate on taking deep breaths from your low belly by pushing out your low belly every time you breathe.Place one hand on your stomach, just underneath your belly button.
Drop your jaw and breathe in, filling your lower stomach up like a balloon.
Release all the air by hissing until you run out of breath.
Try this three times a day, every day.
Practice yawning and opening your throat. Try to mimic the feeling you get when you yawn every time you sing.

, When your clench your jaw, the sound has to come out of a much smaller opening in your mouth. The clenching causes tension, which is then reflected in the way your voice sounds when you sing.For a wider, fuller sound, drop your jaw as you sing.
Loosen your jaw a few times every day to make sure you’re not unconsciously clenching your teeth.
Try propping your mouth open with a bottle cork and saying “A-E-I-O-U.”, Singers rely on their breath to sing well, and if you’re hunched over, you can’t breathe deeply. Stand with your feet apart, and your shoulders back. Keep your chin pointed down and flex your pectorals.Singers tend to tip their chins up to try to reach the high notes, but this can cause vocal problems.
Stand in front of a mirror to watch yourself sing. Make sure you don't start hunching over as the song progresses.

"
"
Practice every day.,
Record yourself singing.,
Hum in the shower.,
Sing in front of the mirror.",How to Become a Good Singer Without Lessons2," In order to reach your full potential as a singer, you need to practice singing every day. Singers are like athletes, and the more you sing, the stronger your vocal cords will get. Also, the more comfortable you get singing, the better you will be when it’s time to perform in public.Try your best during your practice sessions. If you practice things incorrectly, they will become habits and bad habits are hard to break.
Keep a practice journal to help keep track of what you’re working on.
Write down what you’re doing well and what still needs improvement.

, The way people sound in their heads is completely different from the way they sound to others. Record your practice sessions, then listen to the recordings and analyze them.Listen for notes that are out of tune or places where you sound off key.
Check to see how your voice sounds – does it sound pitchy, like you’re running out of breath?
Once you have made your observations, set new goals of how to improve and try to execute on those goals.

, You may be familiar with singing in the shower, but for singers, humming is actually more effective. Humming will cause your vocal cords to stretch thinner, improving flexibility and expanding your vocal range.Close your mouth and make an “mmm” sound while pretending you have gum in your mouth.
Hum scales or your favorite song.

, A singer’s voice is only part of the package – singers also have to be very strong performers. Singing in front of a mirror will help you gauge how your movements look, judge how well you're emoting and decide how believable you look when you’re performing in character.If you’re performing for musical theater, remember to perform in a heightened manner.
Practice what you’re going to say in between songs, or as you’re introducing yourself.
Use the mirror to see if there are any points where you look scared, or like you’re thinking about what comes next.

"
"
Sleep regularly.,
Hydrate your body.,
Cut out caffeine.,
Warm up your voice.",How to Become a Good Singer Without Lessons3," Singers don’t have the luxury of replacing their instrument because their body is their instrument. If you’re low on energy, it will affect your body and your voice.Figure out how much sleep you need every night. Make a bedtime and stick to it.
The more energy you have, the more energy you can use to power your voice.

, When your vocal cords are dry, your voice comes out sounding weak and scratchy. In order to keep your voice sounding strong and healthy, drink water consistently throughout the day.Have a glass of water during every meal and another one during a snack.
Carry a water bottle around with you throughout the day so you don’t get thirsty.

, Coffee dehydrates the vocal cords, so singers should stay away. Instead, pour 1 teaspoon of manuka honey into a mug of warm water and add a few drops of lemon to taste.The honey and lemon will help stave off any colds or flus.
Try drinking this every morning with breakfast so you don’t forget.

, Before you can start singing the song you’re working on, you need to warm up your voice. Without warming up, your voice will sound rusty and it’s possible over time you could do actual harm to your vocal cords.Try going up and down scales a few times to warm up.
Loosen your tongue by saying a tongue twister. Try saying “Mama made me mash my M&M’s” ten times, picking up the speed each time.
Warm up your body as well. Singers hold tension in their shoulders, necks, backs, faces and jaws, so stretch and massage those areas to keep them loose.

"
"
Get voice training regularly.,
Know your range.,
Focus on your breath.,
Learn proper singing posture.,
Warm up before you sing.,
Learn to recognize pitch.,
Practice singing daily.,
Drink enough water.No matter how great of a singer you are, you won't sound good if you're dehydrated.,
Don't eat dairy or sweets before singing.,
Don't smoke.Smoking damages your lungs, preventing you from being able to breathe properly while you sing.,
Do breathing exercises often.,
Don't strain your voice or overuse it.",How to Become a Better Singer," One major way to become a better singer is to have vocal training. Just like playing a sport or exercising, your voice is a muscle that you need to work out in order to develop your voice. By having a professional voice coach, you can learn techniques that will improve your voice. Your voice is an instrument, like a piano that a coach can help you master.Consider getting private singing lessons from a voice coach who can help you with techniques that will develop your unique voice.
If you’re in school, consider joining the choir. Being in choir is a great way to become a better singer as it will help you to learn how to sing with others, read music, and can give you confidence by not having to sing alone.;
, Becoming a better singer is partly about knowing your range and sticking to it. Some people have more range than others, but everyone has a sweet spot where your voice sounds best.


There are seven main ranges: Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Alto, Countertenor, Tenor, Baritone, and Bass. The first three are typically the ranges of women, while the last four are men’s ranges.
To find your range, picture your voice like a ferris wheel. Start at the top, singing the highest note you can and go down the scale to the lowest note you can hit.

Play notes on a piano to compare your pitch to the piano notes to help you find your range.

, Learning how to breathe properly is an essential part of becoming a better singer. Be sure to take a deep enough breath before singing a line so that you have enough air to carry out every word.Breathe in through your belly, not through your chest.This improves your sound and allows you to better control your voice. To be sure you are breathing properly, put your hand on your belly and try to push it out with your belly expanding it as you inhale.
Take a few minutes to practice breathing through your belly daily. You can do this either standing up or laying down. Again, be sure your belly is rising every time you take a deep breath.

, Most singing teachers suggest standing rather than sitting to achieve the best sound. Sitting collapses your muscles and can hinder your ability to get a proper breath.


Keep your head up and inline with your shoulders. Picture your spine like a straight line extending through the crown of your head.Let your jaw drop, and keep your tongue relaxed toward the front of your mouth.Relax your shoulders.Lift the roof of your mouth in the back as if you were going to yawn.This opens up the throat and allows more air to flow through.

, Singing a song doesn't count as a warm-up, because you naturally focus all of your efforts on trying to sound good rather than on your form and technique. Warm-ups, on the other hand, isolate certain problem areas and open up your range.


Remember that warm-ups are not intended to sound good. In fact, most of them sound rather silly and obnoxious, even if you have a professional singing voice. Find a private place to do your warm-ups if you don't want to disturb others.
Be sure to warm up both the upper and lower voice. The upper voice is breathier and lighter-sounding than the lower voice, which is more solid and loud. To find your upper voice, mimic an opera singer. Your lower voice is closer to the range in which you generally speak.
Practice warm ups that stretch your mouth. Do scales with an “Ooh wee ooh oohweeoohweeohh” sound stretching the corners of your mouth wide. Or practice tongue trills while starting at your highest note and moving down the scale to your lowest., The best way to do this is to sing along with a piano or keyboard, if you have one. Press down on a key, and as it rings out, match your voice to it with an ""ah"" sound. Do this for every musical note: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, G, and G#.


The sharp notes are the black keys on the piano to the right of the corresponding note on the white key.

, The more you sing, the stronger your voice becomes. Remember, your voice is a muscle that needs to be exercised.Though everybody has a natural range, you can actually expand the upper and lower limits of your vocal range over time simply by practicing often and doing your exercises.
Sing along to your favorite songs for practice. Keep in mind though that you may not have the same voice as your favorite singers. You won’t become a better singer by mimicking other singers only. Sing in your own voice.

, You should drink at least 8 glasses of water each day.


Don't drink alcohol or caffeine before you sing because these substances dehydrate you.
You also want to avoid sugary drinks as well.
Decaffeinated green teas or warm water with honey and lemon can help to improve and lubricate your vocal chords., Foods like yogurt, cheese, and ice cream cause excess mucus to form in the throat, which makes singing difficult.Additionally, salty and spicy foods because these foods can irritate your throat and vocal chords.
Other foods that may cause acid reflux like heavy or spicy foods can also make breathing harder and irritate your vocal chords.

, It also dries out the throat, which will affect your sound.


If you are a smoker and want to become a better singer, you should consider quitting. However, in the meantime, make sure to drink extra water, smoke lighter cigarettes, and avoid smoking as much as possible on days when you have to sing.

, Even if you don't have time to do a proper warm-up or sing every day, you should practice taking deep breaths into your belly every single day. This alone can significantly improve your voice in the long-run.


You can combine breathing exercises and improve your breath with yoga, or going on runs.
Train like Mick Jagger. The singer is notorious for training for his concerts by running and cross-training while singing to ensure that he can move freely across an entire stage without running out of his breath., Pushing your voice by singing too loud, too high, or for too long can damage your vocal chords. Just like any muscle, you need to give your voice time to rest and repair.Stop singing if your throat starts to feel sore, if you experience any pain, or if your voice becomes hoarse.

"
"
Attend every practice if possible.,
Learn your choreography right away, and ask for help when you need it.,
Practice your dances outside of designated practice times with a friend or two.,
Learn your vocals and really project your voice.,
Do not appear nervous or stiff onstage.,
Read the lyrics of your songs out loud in front of a mirror to find meaning and have reacting facials that are appropriate.,
Always use your facials.,
Sign up for a show choir camp during the summer for a place to hone both your singing and dancing abilities.",How to Be Good at Showchoir," It is essential that you are there when the group is learning new choreography or a new song. Even normal practices are important, since you A) May end up learning new skills and B) Practice really does make perfect. If you can't attend a practice or rehearsal, notify your director in advance. Don't ""forget"" to tell them. This makes you look very irresponsible, and may inhibit your chances at advancing in the group.;
, Clarify any problems with your choreographer so you don't learn bad dancing habits.


Don't talk at dance camps. Not only is this disrespectful to the choreographer, it makes learning a new dance more difficult for you and those around you.
Dance days mean movement, and movement means you should wear something comfortable. Sweats, shorts and leggings, and dance pants are all appropriate things to wear.

, Help and encourage one another.

, Don't fade away as you get to a difficult dance break or if you must spin away from the audience.

, Leave everything on the stage, which means perform to the very best of your ability.

, (Example: If you are singing ""Nobody No One Can Take Away My Song,"" look as if you truly feel that no one can take away your song.)

, What you do with your face is much more important that anything your feet do. Exaggerate your normal emotions and project them through your entire face.

, Camps are recommended for those the are planning to audition for a choir their first time.

Take singing lessons.Whether you’re already convinced that you’re going to be the next star, or you’re just starting out, you can benefit from taking lessons.,
Practice.,
Get a degree.While you don’t need a specific degree or educational background to become the next idol, if you are serious about establishing a career as a singer, then you can benefit from getting an education.,
Learn to read music..Even if you’ve got a beautiful voice, if you can’t read music, then you’re illiterate for the purposes of your dream career in music.,

, As a singer, your voice is your instrument. If you want to become a virtuoso, you have to practice, practice, practice.Whether it's singing in the shower, in the car, for your grandparents, in a church choir, or in your room alone, practice.


Practice singing your favorite songs, but also ones in different styles. You can learn a lot by trying different types of music.
Singing is a very physical art. In addition to trying to hit the right notes, practice breathing right as you sing, holding your body well, etc.Through lots of practice, you will learn your capabilities and characteristics as a singer, such as your vocal range, natural tone, and preferred styles.

, Many colleges and universities offer undergraduate and graduate degrees in fields such as music and vocal performance. These can deepen your knowledge and experience, making you a better singer overall.


In addition to studying the foundations of music theory and vocal performance, it is a good idea to take courses or get a second degree in a field such as business or marketing. This diversifies your education and can provide you with valuable skills to draw on later when trying to promote yourself as a singer and establish yourself in the music business.
Many schools require you to audition to enter a degree program in music.

, Knowing how to read music helps you communicate with other performers, write your own songs, and deepen your knowledge of the art. If you don’t get a formal background in music, then do some independent study to learn how to read music and understand the basics of music theory (rhythm, harmony, etc.).

, Singing well is a skill in and of itself. However, if you have at least basic skills on another instrument, you will be one step ahead. Being able to play an instrument such as the guitar, piano, or drums while you sing helps you practice, write songs, and communicate ideas to other musicians. Proficiency on multiple instruments can increase your chances of finding gigs and other opportunities., To sing well in front of other people, you have to be confident in yourself and be charismatic.The only way to really develop confidence as a singer is to get out there and sing as much as possible. You can try:


Doing karaoke
Busking
Joining a talent show
Performing in a singing competition
Offering to sing at parties, weddings, in religious ceremonies, for your family on holidays, and for any other public occasions

, These might include a church choir, school chorale, glee club, community chorus, a barbershop quartet, a caroling group, etc. Though you might not be in the spotlight if you’re singing with the group, you can still learn a lot and push yourself to improve.


If you’re interested, you can ask your singing group director about opportunities to sing a solo.

, Once you’ve gained some chops as a singer, you’ll want to concentrate on becoming more unique. You can make a good start by being flexible.Try singing in as many styles as you can. Then decide which ones you enjoy the most and perform well.


If you have any special qualities as a singer or performer, now is the time to start developing them. For example, perhaps you are able to sing very high notes, or have a “gritty” voice that is well-suited for soul music.

, If you really want to step out as a singer and performer, you can also begin writing your own material.Concentrate on writing songs in whatever style and whatever form you enjoy the most, but always look for opportunities to expand and develop your art.


You can write both music and lyrics yourself, or work with a collaborator to develop one or the other.
If you play an instrument, use it to help you compose your musical ideas, even if you plan for a song to eventually use a different instrument.
Keep a notebook to jot down any musical or lyrical ideas whenever inspiration strikes you.

, Succeeding as a singer takes a lot of work, and more than likely you will encounter setbacks and rejection on the way.Being patient is really important.Despite some stories of stars who seem to break out overnight, most singers put in a long time and a lot of hard work before making it.


Define the success you want to have for yourself.You can create a five-year plan to define where you want to go as a singer. However, embrace change and accept that you plan will likely change, at least somewhat.

, As soon as you can, look for a job that pays you to be a singer. This will add professionalism to your experience. Even if the job isn’t glamorous, it might open doors.


Paid gigs for singers can include singing on a cruise ship, at a theme park, in a club, at weddings, at parties, doing jingles for commercials, etc.Some singers are able to find work as a backup singer for another local or touring artist.This can be a great networking opportunity. Look for notices about auditions you can try out for, or contact artists directly.
You can start looking for paid gigs at local clubs and other venues, though it may help if you have a manager, your own equipment, and a demo.
While waiting for your “break,” you can give singing lessons to others, teach music, work bookings at a club, or in some other job that is related to singing.This can give you valuable experience and income while you pursue your dreams.
Finding regular paying gigs as a singer can be very difficult. If you can’t make ends meet, look for a job in another field, and work on your singing career in your free time., You can increase your gig opportunities if you have your own performance equipment. This will allow you to seek gigs at venues that don’t have a sound system, or at ones that prefer you to use your own. Musical equipment can be expensive. You don’t necessarily need to have top-of the line equipment or every new gadget when you are just starting out. If you are serious about your singing career, however, you will want to get specific equipment as soon as you can, such as:A microphone
A PA system
A vocal processor
Any effects equipment you depend on

, Once you have polished a set of your own songs or covers, you’ll want to start recording material to use as a demo. Your recordings can be used to help get you gigs, contracts, and other opportunities. You can book time at a professional studio (which can be expensive), but it is fairly easy to make a decent recording in a home studio using consumer-grade computers and software.For most demo purposes, you only need about 4 songs. You can always record more if you want, however, and choose the best ones.

, A manager can help you find gigs, be promoted, make contacts, negotiate contracts, earn more money, and develop your career.You can look for professional managers in your area, or even ask a friend or family member to help you out.


Professional managers will charge a fee, which may be a percentage of what you earn from gigs and other sources. Make sure to get a written contract you can both agree on.

, Your manager can help you send your demo out to clubs, radio stations, record labels, etc. as you seek opportunities.Make sure your demo showcases your strongest work, and puts your most accessible work first.Along with the demo itself, you should also consider including a brief cover letter and/or resume that lists your experience and achievements as a singer.


Contemporary demos might not be a physical cd or item, but a set of tracks online. Either way, the same considerations apply.

, In this day and age, if you want to make it as a singer, you need some kind of online presence.Make professional profiles for yourself on various social media, post recordings and videos of yourself performing, and look into getting your music listed with streaming and download services.


It may be harder to make money directly by streaming, but it might get your name out there and encourage people to come see you perform.

, Self-image and appearance are important for singers.As a performer, you are projecting an image of yourself and the style of music you specialize in. The clothes you wear, the way you move, and other physical aspects of performing are important. Think carefully about how you want to use your look to relate to an audience as well as to convey what makes you unique.


For instance, if you want to perform classical music, it usually makes sense to wear formal clothing. If you want to set yourself apart, however, you might perform Beethoven in a t-shirt and torn jeans.
Likewise, if you are into goth rock, your audience might find it strange if you show up for performances wearing overalls and a cowboy hat. Then again, this might get you noticed.

, To “make it,” most singers need to tirelessly promote themselves.Don’t let any opportunity pass by. In addition to seeking gigs and recording opportunities, you can also:


Network at events like SXSWSell merchandise with your logo or name (t-shirts, stickers, hats, cds, etc.)

Make a press kit to share your identity as a singer

Don't give up.",How to Be Discovered As a Singer (Teens)," A lot of people who want to be discovered as a singer really mean that they want to be discovered as a super star. But there's a difference, and a timeline, between the two. Think about this:


A professional singer is someone with substantial experience and usually musical education under her or his belt.
A professional singer is someone who sings and performs on a very regular basis, from 1 to 5 times a week and several hours per night. Her or his success can remain local or go global.
A super star might come out of a great singer, but that person didn't necessarily have to be a professional singer previously.
A super star usually achieves international and sometimes global success.;
, Much like any other career path, passion is key in paving your road to success. But if that passion is based solely on the desire for money and fame, your career (and happiness) might be short lived. Try to think about the following questions:


What do you get out of singing?
Where/what venues are your favorite performance sites?
In what particular field do you want to earn respect and appreciation?
Do you enjoy large or small audiences?
Is recognition of your talent more important to you than the actual performing?

, Maybe your parents want you to be the next Pavarotti and insanely wealthy. Always ask yourself if that is also what you truly want.

, As in most other professions, lots of practice is absolutely necessary. Not just for the quality of tone, but also for your own comfort level.


Make it a goal to practice at least a few times a week, and ideally everyday.
Hold yourself accountable by entering your planned practice times in a calendar or planner.

, Remember the saying, all good things come to those who wait? As in many other aspects of life, being patient can make a big difference in the final outcome. Don't rush things. And take time to refine your skills.

, Practice, practice, practice. And then practice some more. As previously mentioned, allot some time on a daily or weekly basis to polish your talent. Here are some suggestions on where you might want to practice:


Find a place where you can be alone and undisturbed for your entire practice.
Bathrooms, stairwells, and hallway can provide great acoustics.
Sing in your car on your way to work, shopping, or any destination.
If you need any instruments or tools to accompany your practice, make sure to leave them set up for the next time.

, Are you a morning person? Or do you prefer to work late into the night? Understanding your internal clock and lifestyle can make a big difference in how effective and satisfying your singing practice will be. Any time is a good time as long as it fits your lifestyle. Some things to consider might be:


Is your home very crowded/loud during the day?
Do you entertain guests at night on a regular basis?
Do you have commitments during certain hours that might derail your practice?
Try to practice for at least 15 to 60 minutes at a time.

, Research has shown that consistent and mindful awareness can help you reap benefits in many situations and for many objectives. Going to a guided mediation session can be very useful at first, especially if you have little to no experience with this practice.

, While some singers achieve great success without ever taking lessons, it certainly never hurts and can only improve your skills. Plus, you might meet important people in the industry.

, At an early stage, you can't afford to say no to any offer. Yes, even if it's singing a children's birthday party or at your school event. Remember, these are all great opportunities to practice your singing and to become very comfortable on stage.

, There are many appeals to not starting off solo, one of which is the camaraderie and networking opportunities you might get from joining forces with other like-minded musicians.

, You won't need to move right away, but you do eventually want to put yourself in the right field of vision. In other words, stay on top of where music is produced and where people tend to be discovered. This might also depend on your chosen music field. For example:


Nashville is the place to be if you're aiming to be in the country music industry.
Los Angeles or New York are general centers for music and entertainment.

, If you're like most teens today, you're probably very comfortable using social media to communicate with peers and friends. Take it to the next level by applying your tech know-how to promote yourself and your musicCreate a Business Facebook Page to keep people and potential fans posted on what you've been doing, and where you'll be performing next.
Ask people to 'like' you on your Facebook Page (yes, even if it's super uncomfortable for you).
Keep your Facebook Page up-to-date. This is very important, and something that a lot of people neglect.
Link your new Facebook Page to your Twitter account for additional exposure.

, Appropriate spaces might be bars, clubs, and/or restaurants, to only name a few. You could also post your fliers in coffee shops, and anywhere that will allow you to.

, You shouldn't have to wait until a record label signs you in order to get your music heard. At this stage, you need to find a music studio that will engineer your music with you. There are, most likely, many options out there. Focus on finding a studio with affordable rates. Keep some of the following things in mind:


Visit as many studios as you can.
Inquire about who exactly will be working with you on your recording.
Research the studio to get a feel of other artists' experiences.
Though the cost matters, it's crucial that the studio of your choice has the newest technology.
Check that their technology actually works.
Try singing in their recording booth to get a sense of the acoustics.

, Most studios record 2 hours a session, and they're usually not cheap, so make sure you know what piece(s) you want out first. Keep in mind that most labels only listen from 20 to 30 seconds of what you submit, so you need to record the absolutely best song(s) you have.

, Once you've gotten your music recorded, consider selling it on iTunes. It can be an excellent way to get your music out faster, and see how people like it. It's free to sign up, though additional terms of sale apply for any music you sell directly through it. Here are some pointers:


Have your Universal Product Code (UPC) and International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) at hand.
Have your tax I.D. ready. It's required for the verification process through iTunes.

, Even if you don't achieve the success you want after multiple attempts, keep trying. Remember, nothing worthwhile comes quickly or easily.

It's roughly estimated that it takes 10,000 hours of practicing to become truly proficient in a skill, and singing is no exception.This will probably mean sacrificing a lot of time doing other things, like hanging out with friends, playing video games, and pursuing other hobbies. So you have to really ask and decide for yourself if you really want to make this commitment.


You will probably face a lot of competition and roadblocks.
Even after you become successful, you may not see a lot of profit at first, and there will likely continue to be a lot of work involved, like signing autographs for hours, traveling for tours, having to write and rewrite melodies and lyrics, long nights at the studio, etc. Although it is a very glamorous and rewarding job, it is not always easy.;
, You should find out more information about what other modern child singers' experiences have been like in order to understand what the process is like, and how long it will be like. You will also want to start researching to see what kind of music you want to sing.


Pick a particular person you admire, like Aaron Carter or Charlotte Church. Use a search engine like Google, Bing, or Yahoo to find interviews and articles written about their careers. Try search terms like ""Name Interview,"" ""Name on Success,"" or ""Name music industry.""
Try finding the artist's Wikipedia page by searching for them at Wikipedia or any search engine. Scroll to the bottom and look in the ""References"" section for articles hosted online for interviews and other articles about their career history.
Go to your local library and ask a librarian for help finding more information about the music industry and child singers; they should be able to help you locate biographies and autobiographies for current and past famous individuals.

, Maybe you already think you know what style of music you want to sing, or maybe you have no clue, but you should make sure you know which genre you want to pursue. It would be a waste of time and energy to think you want to be a country singer only to realize three years into training that you want to sing in the opera some day. Research all kinds of different artists and genres of music by listening to them to discover what you like, and what sounds you think you can envision your voice contributing to.


Try web services like Last.fm or Musicovery to build your own radio station that features songs that match your taste or mood.
Try Earbits Radio's web service or surfing your local radio stations on a car radio for different music genres.
Ask your parents and grandparents to introduce you to music they enjoy; it's probably very different than what you and your friends like to listen to.

, ""Successful"" is a really vague word, and it could mean a lot of things, especially in today's day and age where there are many paths to choose from. Do you want to be an internet sensation? Do you want to sign onto a record label and perform all over the country? Do you want to star in Broadway or go onto a career in the opera someday? The answers to these questions will determine the kind of training you will need to pursue.

, In addition to being time-demanding, in order to pursue this career you will need money. There will be things you need to purchase and invest in along the way like training, equipment, and clothes. It will also be emotionally demanding, since you may have to face rejection, criticism, and other difficulties. There are also things that you may not be able to do for yourself as a minor, like driving yourself to auditions or signing legal paperwork. You are going to need the support of your parents or legal guardians in order to pursue this career.

, Because becoming a singer will be a lot of work for both you and your parents, you need to show them you have put a lot of thought into this decision despite your young age. If you simply say, ""I think it will be a lot of fun,"" they may come up with counter arguments like, ""But do you know how much time and energy this will take?"" You will need to use the research you did before to prove to them you know what you're talking about.


Try treating this like writing a persuasive essay. If you can think of all of the bad reasons someone could come up with, then you can think of good reasons and arguments to oppose those bad reasons. Be sure to back it up with facts when possible. So, if your parents say ""You won't be able to spend time with your friends,"" you can say, ""I can join the school or church choir and make friends that share my passion for singing.""
Rehearse your argument to yourself. You will want to make sure you remember your points for when you have a discussion with them.

, Having done the research already, you should now be ready to tell your parents how you feel. Remember to stay calm and in control even if they are initially resistant. Instead, continue to maturely show them you're interested by looking into joining a church or school choir, singing whenever you have the opportunity, even casually, and occasionally trying to have more conversations with them about it. Some arguments could go like this:


""I don't think that's a good idea. You need to go to school."" ""I can still go to school. I would do all of my practice after school, and any performances would be on the weekends. If I got famous and I had to quit public school, I could get private teachers or do long distance learning through computers.""
""You won't enjoy it. It's a lot of work."" ""I know it's a lot of work. I did a lot of research on what Michael Jackson and Hillary Duff have been through for their singing careers. But, I really believe that I can do this, especially if you'll help keep me on track.""
""Wouldn't you rather just keep singing a hobby that you love?"" ""People say that you should love what you do. I think that if I had a job about something I was passionate about, it would never really feel like work.""
""We don't have that kind of money."" ""We could find ways to make money so I could get training and go to perform. We could do bake sales, and car washes, and I could take small singing jobs in town.""

"
"
Find a teacher.,
Learn and practice.,
Participate in school plays and church choirs.,
Audition for singing opportunities.,
Take singing jobs.",How to Become a Child Singer2," You will need a trainer or mentor to help you learn the correct habits to take care of your vocal chords so that you don't accidentally damage them. They can help you decide what songs to sing, teach you scales and the basics of music, and give you private lessons to identify your areas of weakness and strength.To find a teacher, you can look online to websites like ClassicalSinger.com or NATS.org which host searchable directories as well as magazines, online communities, your music teacher at school, or the parents of any friends who are also taking voice lessons.
Your teacher does not have to be accredited, a professional singer, or cool. Instead, look at a teacher's history and see how their students have fared.
Even if you believe that you have not and will never injure your voice, there may be tiny things you do that you are unaware of that could have serious consequences later. A teacher can identify and stop you from doing those things so that you can have a long and successful career., While there are some people who brag about teaching themselves and not knowing about the mechanics, if you want a career in music, then you will need to understand notes, melody, harmony, keys, scales, measures, beats, majors, and minors as well as many, many other things.While this may feel daunting at first, it is necessary so that you can both improve yourself to stand out from the competition as well as to show other people that you are serious.


Consider songs as mini plays where you, the singer, are playing a part. Ask yourself who you're supposed to be, why you're singing, how you're supposed to feel, and who you're singing to.You will need to spend many hours practicing the basics likes scales both at home and in your lessons.

, You should try to make yourself known locally. School plays with singing parts and solos in your school or church choir are a great, free way to try to seek the spotlight that contribute to your community. Have someone record your performance to distribute it online to family, friends, and social media followers later.

, If you feel ready for bigger audiences, auditioning for a broadcasted TV show like America's Got Talent is one way of getting your name and face out there. There are also national and local casting calls going on all the time. Try 2016auditions.com, kidscasting.com, and castingcallhub.com for roles involving singing and dancing. There are also prestigious regional competitions for singers that you can find more information about at NATS.org.When you show up to audition, be sure to be dressed nicely, have your song materials preselected, be aware of what you're auditioning for (especially if it is a musical play with a story and specific songs), and be sure to have a good attitude.
Auditioning is a skill itself: you will probably need to audition many times to learn what kinds of questions and suggestions you will receive, as well as how to handle yourself. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the role the first, second, or even tenth time., Especially if you're looking for work as a singer-songwriter or singing as a pop star, try looking for local places like coffee houses and restaurants that hire singers for live entertainment.This will help get your name and face out there to get more and bigger jobs. It will also help you all to recover costs for training and advertising.


Use websites like Craigslist, Gigsalad, Backstage.com, YapTracker, and ReverbNation to find singing jobs that you can take.Some, but not all, of these are free to use.
Some jobs, often called ""gigs,"" will help you to build a fanbase but don't pay well, like playing at a friend's house for a birthday party, and others will pay well but not build you much of a fanbase, like singing for a wedding. Many gigs call in between as well. Try to consider what your goals are with taking a job: is it most important to make more fans, or to be paid well, or have you reached the point that you should aim for both?Be prepared to be persistent. Some places will not agree to book you the first, second, or even ninth time you call!Be careful when accepting jobs: have your parents or a legal guardian look at the job posting with you and contact the individual hosting it for you. These are people that you do not know, and it is important that even if you are eager to start making a name for yourself that you be safe.

Identify the labels or organizations you want to pursue.,
Use social media to advertise yourself.,
Build relationships in the music community.,
Invest in a professional website.,
Seek talent scouts.",How to Become a Child Singer3," There are a lot of different organizations in the music industry today: aside from the opera and musical theaters like Broadway, there are record labels. Record labels, or record companies, are responsible for marketing, coordinating the production, manufacturing, and distributing music. There are three major labels (Universal, Sony, and Warner) as well as many sublabels,vanity labels, and independent labels.You will need to find out who produces the kind of music you want to make and find out who the executives and producers for that company are, as well as whether or not they accept demos and what their guidelines are.

, Many aspiring artists use platforms such as Youtube and Facebook to post videos of themselves singing to get their name and face out to the world. Hundreds to millions of people can be aware of you with just a click of the button; ask your friends and family to help you get a start by liking and sharing your work on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Other places where you can distribute or advertise your music include Reddit music, Last.FM, and Spotify., A lot of people use popular blogs like Pitchfork, Stereogum, DatPiff, and the A.V. Club to find new artists to follow. These bloggers usually have a listed contact email. Send them your music or a link to your social media.Once you've figured out which labels you want to join, find and add them on FaceBook and Twitter; if you found the names of their employees, add them too. Try talking with them daily to make them notice you.If any of the labels or their employees or bloggers happen to be local, try calling them, scheduling a meeting with them, and building a more personable relationship with them.

, Take the next step to look professional and invest in a .com name with your band or artist name. Be sure to be certain that all of the graphics, logos, and pictures of yourself are professional quality. To keep it affordable, try posting yourself to websites like 99designs.com and Crowdspring.com, where aspiring designers can submit potential designs to you for a price you've already set.Your parents may be initially reluctant to invest in a website and professional designing. Search for ""cheap web hosting"" or ""cheap web domains"" to try to find options they might be less reserved about. Explain to them why it's important that you have a professional image, and maybe even frame it in a way they can relate to, like, ""When you look for someone to come do a job for you, don't you feel better when you see that they have a nice looking website with information that's neatly maintained,"" or ""When you buy products, do nice colors and good packaging appeal to you? Would you want to buy something ugly? What I'm doing is a service, and I want people to buy my music someday. I want record companies to buy my image.""
If your parents are still concerned about the costs involved, you can try making a GoFundMe, a Kickstarter, or a Patreon for you to have some more sustainable income to reach your goals.

, A talent scout is a person whose job it is to find untapped talent in the world and help them get work. They can help you find auditions, jobs, and get your name to a record label.You can find searchable directories for talent agents at both Backstage.com and Laauditions.com. You may also find their profiles on Facebook and LinkedIn.


When contacting a talent scout, send a packet with your headshot, resume, and a cover letter. You will likely need your parents' help.
Make sure the resume is as short and well-summarized as possible, but include details like special talents, teachers, and specific training you've received.
Make sure if you include personal references they will speak well about you.
Follow up with an agency after sending in a submission.
If you get into a showcase seeking representation, ask around to find out who present is already represented and by whom.Be careful to only work with reputable people and to avoid scams. Watch out for people who make big promises, rush casting calls and immediate auditions, promise extremely high pay or say there's no experience needed, casting calls on Craigslist supposedly made by large agencies, those not looking for specific types or ages, or anyone hiding their identity.Beware of agencies that ask you to pay up front for representation, shopping mall auditions, highway billboards, or TV or print ads--instead, you'll find specific information on their individual websites detailing how to submit yourself for consideration."
"
Make a demo.,
Get feedback.,
Polish your sound.,
Understand how labels work.,
Submit your demo.,
Sign a contract.",How to Become a Child Singer4," Although this particular step can be challenging, once you have the training to do so, you should try making your own music. In order to submit material to a label, you need to have content to display to them, but generally speaking it needs to be material that is unpublished, completely original, and uncopyrighted.Your demo should have no more than three tracks to it.

, You need to get constructive criticism on how your demo has turned out once it's completed. You need to find out if the sound is good, what can be improved, and get advice on how to go about that. Family, friends, and fans are not good sources because they want to be supportive and not hurt your feelings. You should instead seek to have your mentors, teachers, and any industry connections you have listen to your music and tell you their honest thoughts.You do not have to change everything that is suggested to you, but multiple people pointing to the same thing(s) is a sign that something really does need to be changed.
Do not take people's criticism personally. It is not an attack on you, or to say that you are untalented or unskilled. If anything, people who offer you truthful advice are doing so with the intention of help you be the best you can.

, After you've received your criticism, it's time to make the changes that you agree need to be made. You also have to polish things by mixing and mastering your music. The idea here is that you want it to be as professional sounding as possible., If you really want to be signed by a record label, then you have to understand how they work. These are businesses, and they have to make money to cover costs; the bigger a fanbase, the better your music, and the more dedication and marketing you've already put into yourself, the more certain they will feel that you are someone they can make money off of signing. Good labels receive dozens if not hundreds of demos all the time. In order to stand out, you need to find a way to be truly unique and catch or have a lot of attention already.Some labels will not even accept submissions unless the artist is already entirely self sufficient.
It is because of how difficult it is to get noticed and accepted by a label that it is extremely important that you follow as many of the steps in Making Yourself Visible as possible.

, Pick five labels to send your demo to, but only send it to one label at a time. Send your demo to the appropriate demo submission email address, or a contact at the label that you have hopefully developed a good relationship with. You will need to upload the tracks to either Dropbox or Soundcloud first and make sure they are set to private so that only the person you have sent the link to can listen to them. Make sure that your email is short, to the point, and polite.If you don't hear back from them after a week, send a follow up email to ask them if they have received your email and had a chance to listen to your music. Remember to always be polite. For every week you don't hear back, you can send another email.
If you haven't heard back after a month, or they say no, it's time to move onto the next label.

, If the label decides that you have the sound and presence that they're looking for, they'll contact you with more information about drafting up a contract. Although it might be tempting to sign one right away so that you can begin reaping the rewards of all your hard work so far, be careful. Record deals have a reputation for being very limiting for the artist, so you'll want to be sure you have your parents and maybe even a lawyer involved in reviewing and negotiating the contract."

Don't try too hard.",How to Be a Rock Chick," Part of the rock persona is advertising your love for rock bands. T-shirts ranging from vintage hair bands to favorite contemporary rock groups will work.


Original band t-shirts purchased from the merch table at a concert or a band's website are the best way to go.
Vintage t-shirts from classic bands help make your look authentic. To find these vintage shirts, search local thrift and second-hand clothing stores, online sites, or garage sales.
Many retailers sell vintage-inspired shirts featuring acts such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Johnny Cash.
If you want to vary your look from strictly band t-shirts, try a shirt that reflects the sometimes rebellious nature of the rocker lifestyle. Guitars, drums, and alcohol are staples for rock enthusiasts, so try a shirt advertising Fender guitars or your favorite booze.;
, Plaid is a versatile pattern that can go with many different styles. Tie a flannel shirt around your waist when wearing jeans and a band t-shirt, or even a dress. Wear the flannel shirt buttoned up with a leather jacket and a scarf.When choosing a plaid shirt for rocker style, think about the colors. Reds and blacks are more rocker chic than white or orange. But with the right attitude and accessories, any plaid shirt can be incorporated into your wardrobe.
Many major retailers sell flannel shirts of all fits and sizes. You can find standard, straight fitting shirts, or tailored, ""girly"" fit shirts that taper around the waist and bust. Also consider checking the local thrift stores, especially if you are in search of the perfect worn in flannel.

, To pull off the rock chic aesthetic, your shirts need to be slouchy and oversized. Buy your clothes a size or two larger than normal; you may even want to opt for male fitted shirts instead of girly fit since girly fit tees are designed to be more form fitting. You want to appear sloppy and unkempt, while still being fashionable.


Consider buying shirts and tank tops with uneven hems. Many shirts are designed with asymmetrical hems that provide an acute angle along your body. This can give your outfit an edgier look.
Pull the oversized shirt off one shoulder for an edgy look. Consider cutting the necklines from the t-shirt to make the hole even wider so it will hang from your shoulder better. Cut off the sleeves of t-shirts to make a wicked tank top with unkempt edges.

, The rocker look centers around dark colors - black and grey. Bright pops of color, like red or pinks, are also important in a rock chick wardrobe. If you want to go a bit glam-rock, try bright golds and silvers, glitter and sequins like designer Tom Ford incorporated into a recent rock inspired fashion collection.Blocks of color usually are utilized through shirts, scarves, shoes, or accessories. Usually, the pants are black.

, Rocker chick style isn't all concert tees and leather. Buy a dress in plaid or a vintage floral pattern; if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, try dresses in leather, velvet, or lace. Instead of a dress, try a flowing plaid or floral skirt and pair it with your concert tee and flannel shirt or denim jacket for a softer rock look.

, A perfect rock chick look can hardly be complete without a leather jacket. Cropped, fitted jackets over slouchy band t-shirts is a perfect combination. Try looking for vintage leather jackets at thrift stores.


The jacket doesn't have to be real leather. Faux leather jackets are cheaper and sold at most major retailers. Some jackets have studs, lace, or other embellishments that could complete your look.

, Give some versatility to your wardrobe by adding a denim jacket to the mix alongside your motorcycle jacket. A denim jacket can give your outfit a softer, more casual look.


Denim jackets are perfect for adding embellishments. Pin buttons from your favorite bands, sew patches onto the front or back, and personalize your denim for a rocking piece.Jean vests are also a way to vary your look. Cropped vests work best, but any jean vest paired with concert tees or a floral dress can be incorporated into your style.

, This is a must for the rocker chick look. Rips and holes, studs, lace, distressing - it all works. The important thing to remember is the jeans should be black or grey.


Leggings also work. Pair an oversized t-shirt with black leggings for a simple outfit.
Cuff the jeans at the bottom to show off your shoes.

, Just like the leather jacket is a staple, so are leather pants. Leather is expensive, so you can buy faux leather pants or leggings. The leather aesthetic helps sell any rocker persona., Leather pants might not be the most practical during the summer. To keep the rocker chick look despite the heat, wear cutoffs. Many major retailers sell jean shorts with fringed edges, but to give your outfit an edgier, more individualized look, make your own. Purchase jeans from a thrift store and cut the legs to the length desired. You can fray the edges as much as you want for a shredded look.Denim shorts also look great over black leggings or lacy tights, paired with combat boots or motorcycle boots.

, Maybe more important than a leather jacket or leather pants are black leather boots. If you want to go sexy, try leather boots that come up to or over the knee, paired with a dress. Traditional short motorcycle boots are a tougher piece you can pair with anything in your wardrobe.

, Yes, motorcycle boots are a must, but where's the fun in wearing the same shoes with every outfit? Add other pieces to your wardrobe, like combat boots, studded boots and heels, and canvas shoes.


Try unlacing your combat boots for an edgier look.

, Studs are an essential part of the rocker chick persona. Studs can go on anything - boots, vests, jeans, jewelry, bags. The more studs, the better.


You can easily add studs to any pieces you own. Buy studs at the craft store and apply them to your jeans, vest, or anything else.

, Studs, spikes, skulls, birds, hearts, stars, wings - whatever you want on your jewelry, go for it. Black, silver, gold, pink, or mixed colors work when you're combining your pieces into the perfect rocker outfit. Drape a statement necklace around your neck and put on zipper earrings. Wear a bottle cap necklace and stack bracelets on your wrist.Have fun as you match the pieces to your specific outfit.

, The final pieces of your ensemble are a hat and cool sunglasses. Think about what kind of hat or sunglasses matches your outfit to get the right combination.


Try floppy, panama hats, bowler hats, and beanies.
For sunglasses, go for Raybans, aviators, cat-eyes, or round. Basic black might be your best bet, but many of these sunglasses styles come in black and white or black and pink designs that can accent your rocker look.
Try headbands. Instead of a hat, finish your look with a studded or lace headband.

, Studded clutches and fringe bags help complete the rocker chick look.Also think about personalizing your own bag. Add badges, buttons, and studs to have a one of a kind piece.

, Messy hair is part of the rocker chick look, regardless of whether you have long or short hair. Messy curls and waves is a definite rocker chick look, but layers and bangs can give you an edgy look regardless of your hair's texture.


The slouchy, oversized clothing compliments this messy, unkempt look. The hair just perfects the image.

, Brightly colored or two-toned hair screams rock and roll. Go for platinum blonde highlights, or streaks of jet black. Dye a strip in the front blue, purple, or pink for a bit of an edge. If you want to go all out, dye all of your hair a crazy color, like bubblegum pink.

, Rocker chick makeup is a mix of dramatic eyes and neutrals. Feline eyes, smoky shades, and lots of mascara with nude lips are characteristic of the rocker look.


Apply black eyeliner to both the waterline and upper lash line, and smudge it slightly for a messy look. Top that off with eyeshadow in black and greys, and finish with black mascara. Green and blue eyeshadows can work, too.
Paint your nails a dark color to compliment the rest of your look.

, Rockers have always used tattoos as a form of self-expression. Others use piercings to adorn their bodies. Nose rings and tattoos in strategic places can compliment your look.


Tattoos are permanent. Getting them removed is painful and expensive. Only get a tattoo if you truly desire one. Never get a tattoo because you are chasing a trend or trying to impress someone.
Although piercings are less permanent, only get a piercing if you truly want it.

, Rock chicks are very confident. Carry yourself and your look with confidence. A rock girl is a thrill seeker that loves to have fun, but who is also relaxed.


Listen to rock music that you love and get to know a lot about the bands. Go to shows, buy CDs and vinyl, enjoy the music - that's the basis of your persona, after all.
Being rebellious and getting in trouble is stereotypical of a rocker lifestyle. Don't take it too far. You can be an authentic rock chick, enjoy the music and lifestyle, and even have a small rebellious streak without getting into trouble and alienating friends and family.

, The clothes, the make up, the attitude are all just pieces. Part of the persona of a rock chick is not trying too hard. When choosing your outfits, don't overdo it. Don't add everything into one outfit - spread the leather, studs, and layers of jewelry among multiple outfits.


Be true to yourself and your likes and dislikes. This is only a guide; add your own personality and individuality into the way your incorporate the rocker chick persona.
Don't wear or do things that make you uncomfortable. Be yourself; don't be a poser.
Don't brag about yourself or your persona. Just live it.

Get familiar with terminology.,
Keep in mind that everyone has a unique vocal timbre, or ""color"" of voice.,
Once you have figured out your vocal timbre, now's the time to figure out your range.,
Remember however, range is not everything and certainly doesn't say whether you can be a belter or not.,
Become familiar with mixed voice.,
Now the fun part - belting!,
Remember to breathe!,
Keep your jaw relaxed.,
Remember that not all voices are equipped to belt effectively, and this is OK.,
The most important thing to remember though is that if it hurts, STOP!",How to Be a Good Female Powerhouse Singer," ""Powerhouse singing"" is typically referred to by the general public as belting. Belting, however, doesn't always equal very loud vocals. Belting is a specific vocal style most commonly found in broadway singing. It gives the illusion that the chest voice is carried up very high into the head voice range. Actually, skillful singers must learn to mix the two voices to create a seamless and pressure free tone. Carrying only chest voice as high as it can go will create an over abundance of pressure and cause damage. Chest voice is the voice you typically use to speak in and resonates mostly in your chest. Head voice is the higher, lighter voice most people use when singing very softly and it resonates mostly in your head. For the purposes of this article, we will use the terms ""powerhouse vocals"" and ""belting"" interchangeably.;
, In order from lightest to heaviest, they are soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic.



Soubrette is a term used for both color and range. Soubrette voices (such as Britney Spears) typically don't have much range or power, and therefore may not be able to belt.

Lyric voices are light, but heavier than soubrettes and if their voices are used correctly they will easily overpower Dramatic singers. Lyric singers belt with ease and power, but sometimes the sound might be too thin for some to listen to all the time.(such as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhtxYxeZ6I&feature=related (Celine Dion), although their voices tend to have a thinner, possibly more nasal sound.

Spinto is an Italian term that means ""pushed."" Spinto singers, such as Christina Aguilera, can handle belting at intermittent levels, and typically sound very edgy.

Dramatic voices are the heaviest and fullest of all vocal timbres. Laura Branigan is generally regarded as having a dramatic vocal timbre, she was able to belt for long periods of time and has an extremely strong resonance. People with dramatic voices can handle long periods of belting and can typically sing over loud orchestras.

, There are three terms to describe range:


The first is alto (or contralto) and it's the lowest voice of all female voices. Toni Braxton is an alto. Alto voices can typically sing from F3 to F5, although some can go much lower and higher.
Next there is mezzo-soprano, or ""middle soprano."" Mezzo-soprano singers can typically sing from A3 to A5, although again, this can vary.
The highest of the female voices is soprano. Sopranos can typically sing from C4 (also known as middle C) to A5 (also known as high A).
These definitions are for classical vocalists though, and in pop/modern vocals, these definitions are just an estimate. To test your range, simply go to a piano or keyboard and find middle C. Just about anyone can vocalize a middle C. Sing against that, and see how high you can go above it and how low you can go below it. This will give you a general idea of which term describes your range.

, Toni Braxton is an alto which means she has a vocal color that is darker in color than a soprano and is more comfortable singing low (but can certainly sing high) , but she does have a very powerful voice.

, Simply put, mixed voice is just what it's called - a mix between chest voice and head voice, lying between those two registers. Learning to sing with mixed voice and strengthening mixed voice takes a great deal of strain off of your voice when belting, and it also enables you to belt even higher. Mixed voice has a tendency to sound slightly nasal because it resonates mostly in the nasal cavity. Don't worry about this. As long as it's only slightly nasal and not excessively so, it's OK.

, Always remember to support your breath very well! If you don't, your belting will be very ""pitchy"" and generally just not sound good. Relax and trust your voice. Don't try to force it at all. Belting is not something that you can be good at overnight. It takes a lot of practice. Think of it as yelling over music, but don't actually yell! As said before, support that breath! Also, keep good posture. When belting, a good rule of thumb is to make sure you're not tightening your diaphragm up too much. You want your breathing when singing to be more in your stomach than in your chest. When breathing while singing, make sure your stomach is expanding.

, Some people actually forget to take breaths when belting, resulting in them running out of breath mid-note.

, Tightening up your jaw will compromise the sound of your belting, noticeably so.

, Some of the best singers out there can't sing over the sound of bombs, and that's OK. Just like range, power isn't everything. Just work what you have!

, Singing should never be a painful experience! If you experience pain while singing, that is your body telling you that you are doing something wrong or pushing it beyond it's limits. You should never be hoarse (or even worse, completely voiceless) after belting through a song, or even a whole set. If you find that you can't belt without pain or a loss of voice, consult with a voice teacher so you can learn to properly belt without risking your vocal health.

, Or two songs, just in case the person before you sang the same one. You'll be singing it acapella (without any instruments or backing track -- just you) in front of an X-Factor team member and the crowd around you.


Avoid being clichéd. Only sing Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, or Jennifer Hudson if you're just as good. Pick a song that you know won't be the 500th time your judge has heard it that day. If that's the case, you'll be compared to everyone else on two different levels.

The judge doesn't have to know the song. In fact, it may be better if they don't.



, Before the season starts, there is an application form online at the website of your country's version of the X Factor. This is months and months in advance, so you may need to wait until the next season rolls around.


There are plenty of auditions by ""mobile van"" each year. In fact, that's how James Arthur auditioned. Get connected on the website, Facebook, and Twitter for announcements.

, If you missed the online application, there's still an open call. Thousands of people do it. If one is in your area, great! Suit up and start practicing.


In the UK, open call auditions were held in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, and Glasgow.But there were tons of mobile van auditions -- just the beginning of the list is Aberdeen, Colchester, the Isle of Wight, and Dublin.

, On the audition notice received when you fill out your form, it explicitly says to stand out from the crowd. Personalities are so large there really is no limit. Whatever matches your personality, go for it.


This show is all about spectacle. Here's what the form says: ""Dress as the pop star you want to be - we are looking for the next big music sensation so make an impact. We also highly encourage everyone to bring along posters and banners to the open day - the brighter the better!""
Fortunately or unfortunately (no one is quite sure), wearing your wedding dress or a plastic chicken on your head is not unheard of. You may stand out more by not trying too hard, believe it or not.

, If the audition is months away, don't quit. Run through your piece every other day or so until you can do it on one leg with your hands tied behind your back. Stay vocally healthy to boot.


Load up on warm water. Stay away from alcohol (dries out your throat) and definitely don't smoke. If you're concerned you're getting a tickle, go for green tea, pineapple juice, and get on vocal rest. Don't strain your voice -- that'll just wear it out.

"
"
Get there early.,
Be patient.,
Sing your heart out.",How to Audition for the X Factor2," There will literally be thousands of others waiting near you to get their 30 seconds, too. Parking will be limited, so if you can avoid driving, do it. And if you're a minor, bring a guardian with you.


Get there very, very early. People will be waiting in the wee hours of the morning.You may want to bring some food, drinks (water!), a chair, and something to amuse yourself.

, This will most likely take all day. That's even if you've been informed to get there at 8 AM. They are seeing thousands of people and won't likely get started until everything is settled and everyone is ushered into the arena (or whatever the type of venue). Your audition will likely take place 8 or so hours after you've arrived.


Account for the weather. Your hair and makeup may not look as great as you want it to when you're auditioning at 5 PM and got there at 5 AM. Bring extra makeup and comfortable shoes. You'll be grateful you did.

, Finally, the fun part! When your number is called, a team member (someone you won't recognize) will approach you and listen to you sing. You'll be doing this in front of everyone -- there is no designated, blocked-off area for singers. Take a deep breath and go big or go home.


The judge will then give you a polite yes or no. They are not allowed to critique you or give you feedback. If you do make it, you'll be notified of a call back audition at a later date.

Replace the lyrics of your song with “gah.” This vocal exercise can help get rid of nasal singing.,
Plug your nose while you sing.,
Adopt a pleasant expression when you sing.,
Find a voice teacher.,
Keep your back straight and shoulders down.,
Make sure your chin is parallel to the floor.,
Do not lock your knees.,
Stay relaxed.,
Engage your ab muscles.",How to Avoid Singing Through Your Nose," The roof of your mouth is made up of a hard palate and a soft palate. If you touch it with your tongue, you can identify. The hard palate stays in place. This is what's thought of as the roof of your mouth. It's the part of your mouth encased between your teeth, attached to your skull.
When you get further back in your mouth, you reach the soft palate. This is the softer, fleshier area towards the back of the mouth, and includes the uvula. The soft palate can move up and down when you touch your tongue to it. The soft palate. moves whenever you speak, eat, yawn—basically anytime you use your mouth. Lifting your soft palate is key to controlling your voice, and can help you prevent singing through your nose.;
, Imagine there is a ping-pong ball in the back of your mouth. You would need to have your soft palate lifted if there were an object back there taking up space.


Alternatively, you can do a half yawn. Notice that you live your soft palate while you do this. Practicing this will familiarize you with the feeling of lifting your soft palate.
You can also practice inhaling a soft K sound.This will naturally lift your soft palate, just slightly, so it is not as dramatic as the lift would be if you had a ping-pong ball in your mouth.

, Raise your soft palate and speak. You can try talking to yourself or doing something like reading a book out loud with your soft palate raised. It may feel silly and sound silly, but you will train yourself to be able to lift the soft palate on demand. This can also help you learn how to make noise with your mouth while raising your soft palate., Once you are rather comfortable talking with your soft palate raised, practice singing. You should notice a difference in the tone of your voice.Raising the soft palate creates more room for your voice to resonate in your mouth, giving it a richer tone.
You may want to compare the sound to the sound you make when you were singing through your nose by first singing like you used to, with your soft palate lowered, and then singing with your palate raised. It’ll be easier to hear the improvement.

, The sound “g” will naturally move your voice further down, adding richness to your tone and bringing it away from the nose. The “ah” makes you drop your jaw and your tongue, which will also add depth to your tone. Try singing your song, but replacing the words with ""gah."" Simply keep making the noise ""gah"" while following the tune of a song.Once you’ve practiced your song with “gah” sound, try to incorporate the lyrics back in. You may notice you sound less nasally.
If you struggle with sounding nasal at particular places in the song, you can always begin your practice by singing “gah” on those parts of the song before adding the lyrics back in.

, If you are singing through your nose, this will exacerbate the nasal quality. You may sound more nasally when singing through your nose. However, this method will block the nasal passage so you will have to figure out how to sing through your mouth, rather than your nose. This can help your singing down the road. You may sound less nasally once you have experience singing without being able to channel air through your nose., You should strive to sing with your throat open, as this raises your soft palate and can therefore prevent nasally singing. One way to achieve an open throat is to sing with a pleasant expression as this will naturally lift up your throat.Do not attempt to smile, as this can look unnatural. Instead, gently lift up your cheeks. You can do so by slightly lifting the zygomatic muscles. These are the muscles on the side of the mouth you would lift when smiling.
During speech and singing, many people have a tendency to pull their facial muscles down slightly. By adopting a pleasant expression when singing, you can combat this tendency. This can create an open throat, making nasally singing less likely.

, There are some incredible voice teachers out there, who are experts in the field and can help you on your path to singing without sounding nasally. If you walk through vocal techniques with a voice teacher, he or she can provide more specifics based on your personal style and skill set. Look online or in the local yellow pages to find a voice teacher in your area.

, This will help you keep your chest lifted, which can help improve the sound of your singing. Allowing air to more easily travel through your lungs can help you sing with your chest and mouth rather than through your nose.The shoulders should not be shoved back, just slightly back so you are not hunching forward.

, You can use a mirror to check that your chin isn’t raised or tucked in too far., Even if you’re nervous, it’s very important that you keep your knees loose. Locked knees can block some of the veins necessary to get blood to the heart. You could end up losing consciousness., Keep relaxed when you're sitting to sing. Neck muscles and shoulders should be loose. If you’ve had to correct your posture significantly, these new positions will feel uncomfortable for a little while. It may be difficult to relax and loosen up at first. However, keep practicing. A new posture should feel better over time as your body gets used to them.

, You want to make sure that you are engaging your core, but that you are not stiff. You should channeling your breath through your abdomen when you're singing. Try placing one hand on your abdomen. As you breathe, make sure that your abdomen is expanding when you breathe in. This means that it is relaxed. "

Begin with breathing exercises.,
Next, start warming up.,
Find your range.,
Try singing along to a song that you like with a voice recorder nearby.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Practice daily.,
Learn to use your nose.,
Learn to ""cover the voice"" for a fuller sound.,
Practice singing your vowels.,
Practice hitting the high notes.,
Continue your breathing exercises.,
Enter a local singing competition.,
Be sure to get a good teacher if you're serious about developing your skills.,
Once you're confident, perform a song unaccompanied and upload your video to YouTube.",How to Learn to Sing," Breathing exercises will allow you to better control the pitch and duration of your singing. It's no surprise: singers who can breathe deeply and consistently get better mileage out of their voice.

Practice opening your throat opening. Relax and open the jaw like a fish might out of water. Start flexing your facial muscles a little bit in between.
Try the following breathing exercise before you warm up:
Begin by inhaling a couple deep breaths of air. Imagine that the air is really heavy as you breathe it in.
Let the breath fall below your belly button, into your diaphragm. Exhale and repeat several times.
Get a light pillow-feather and practice keeping it in the air, sort of like you're juggling a feather with your air stream.Gradually blow the feather really high up, and try keeping it there.
Don't let your chest collapse as you keep the feather in the air. Try to keep the air stream coming from your diaphragm.

;
, Your vocal chords are a muscle, just like your biceps, and need to get stretched before you do any heavy lifting. You can warm up in a variety of ways.


Practice your major scales, starting with the middle C, moving down in half-steps before moving up. Don't push yourself before you're actually singing, and try to move slowly. As you continue to warm up, you'll get better at articulating all the notes in the scales.
The notes that you will hit start off as C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C and move either up or down one half-step for each new scale.



, Your range is the measure of pitches you can sing between your lowest and highest notes. Try any number of classical musical scales (you can easily find them with a simple online search) and see which notes on the bottom and which notes on the top are impossible for you to clearly sing.

, Make sure the music is quiet and your voice is the real thing that the recorder picks up. After you're done singing, check if you are singing on key. Also check to see if you are:


Articulating words, especially vowels, clearly. In the beginning, over-articulate the words; really practice on getting them right.
Breathing correctly. Hard vocal parts will require you to stretch your voice out over a longer period of time. You'll need to be a strong breather for this.

, Drink lukewarm water for best results, as this will loosen your vocal chords. Give your body time to absorb the water. Avoid dairy products or thick drinks such as smoothies immediately before singing.

, Every day, practice your breathing exercises, warm-up routine, and recorded singing. Listen for parts that you don't hit with your voice and keep chugging. It could take several weeks of practice just to get a single song down pat.

, Good singing involves partial nasal placement; it is our body's soundboard. To avoid sounding nasal to others, however, your throat must be wide open with your tongue out of the way (slightly forward, touching the backs of bottom teeth when singing vowels). Nasality can often be heard in country singing and some R&B/Gospel, but can be unappealing to listen to.

, Resonant, rounded sound is formed by opening the throat and by limiting the nasality. This is called ""covering the voice."" Be careful, however. If you cover it too much, it may become to airy and mushy sounding.

, Again, try to vocalize by using your diaphragm. The vowels, not the consonants, are what you really have to pay attention to.


Do not involve your neck muscles in your singing. Try to keep your neck upright but relaxed.
Practice keeping the back of your mouth open when you vocalize the vowels. Practice voicing the ""ng"" sound in training; the back of your mouth is closed. Now practice voicing the ""ah"" sound, like you're opening your mouth at the dentist. The back of your mouth is now open.

, High notes are the icing on top of the cake: not always necessary, but really wonderful when done right. You probably already know your range by now, so you also know which high notes you can hit and which ones you can't. Be sure to practice hitting the ones you can't yet reach. Practice will make perfect.


Envision jumping as you hit the high note. Perhaps you're jumping onto a trampoline, or maybe you're just jumping up into the air. Imagine hitting your highest point as you reach the high note. Take an adequate breath and keep your mouth open. Hitting a high note doesn't mean you need to increase how loudly you sing.

, Make breathing exercises an ongoing training opportunity. The better you get at breathing, the easier your vocal training will be.


Try this breathing exercisewhere you breathe in and hiss out. Make sure your hiss is very even and consistent. The goal is consistency:
Breathe in for 4 seconds, and then hiss the same breathe out for 4 seconds.
Breathe in for 6 seconds, and hiss out for 12.
Breathe in for 2 seconds, and hiss out for 10.
Breathe in for 4 seconds, and hiss out for 16.
Breathe in for 2 seconds, and hiss out for 16.
Breathe in for 4 seconds, and hiss out for 20.
Breathe in for 2 seconds, and hiss out for 20.



, Be reasonable about how you expect to perform; if you've been singing for less than 3 months and have no formal training, it'll be difficult — but that's what you want, right?


If you're serious about becoming a singer, you'll have to get used to singing in front of a large crowd of people, and in stressful situations. It's one thing to sing to yourself in your bedroom; it's another thing entirely to sing in front of dozens or maybe hundreds of people.

, Voice coaches will be able to give you really good feedback in real time, as well as tips and tricks. They will set a schedule for you and help you meet goals that you set for yourself. A voice coach is absolutely essential for anyone who wants to seriously become a singer.

, The positive feedback you get will most likely far outweigh the negative feedback.

Connect everything up.,
Perform a Sound check.,
Record the music.

,
Clean up the recording.,
Save it as a *.wav file for archiving.",How to Record Live Music," This is probably the most confusing step for beginners as there are lots of cables and adapters to connect. Experiment and make sure you start out at low volume settings and work your way up so you don't blow the speakers or your eardrums.;
, Record a short clip while adjusting the mixer so that the instruments and/or sources are balanced with each other. Also make sure the peaks of the waveforms are not always hitting the very top and bottom of the window, indicating that the recording is ""clipping""--too loud and losing quality. Have your peaks reach the maximum up to 20-40% of the time to record audio that matches the level of most other modern recordings.

,, Various filters may improve the sound and make up for a sub-par recording. ""Normalize"" the recording if the sound is consistently low. If that doesn't amplify it enough to your liking, run a ""compressor"" or ""hard limiting"" on it, which can make soft portions loud while keeping loud portions from clipping any further. Fade in and out if you want to avoid the click as a song starts or ends.

, The wav format is lossless, which means it does not compromise quality, but it takes up more disk space. Also export it to a compressed format like mp3 or ogg if you want to share it over the Internet.

Understand what becoming a Kpop trainee really means.,
Learn to sing or rap.,
Work on your dance moves.,
Learn to act.,
Learn Korean!,
Choose a company to audition for.,
Audition!,
Understand that while it's not essential to have Korean or even Eastern-Asian heritage, the vast majority of artists are actually Korean.,
Get the right style for your audition.,
Be persistent.",How to Be a K Pop Trainee," Expect to work extremely hard, perhaps for 10+ hour days. Even though it seems like a lot of fun when watching your favorite singer or group, being a Kpop star (the word ""idol"" is more widely used) is a lot of work. Although many believe that becoming a celebrity automatically makes a person a millionaire, the Korean music industry doesn't always pay their artists the wages they deserve. The vast majority of fans--and even the people signing up as trainees--are unaware of the conditions that a few idols before them have been subjected to, such as a low salary and poorly-kept dorms. However, there are also many positives, especially if you feel connected to Korean culture, the language, or are passionate about music and dancing. Before you audition for a company, double check that none of its talent has ever filed a lawsuit for issues such as unfair treatment or poor living conditions.

Also, be aware that getting a career isn't guaranteed even after you have become a trainee. You may train for years and never have a chance to debut.;
, In order to become a K-Pop trainee, you must be able to sing (or rap) well, as your main job will be creating music with a heavy emphasis on vocals. If you are a good singer already, that's great. If you think your singing skills are lacking, go to a singing school, hire a voice coach, or search online for some good vocal practices to do every day. If you aren't an amazing singer but have the right charisma and look, you may be picked to be trained as a rapper.


Other musical talents, like knowing how to play instruments, can be handy, but a good voice is essential.
Note that many companies will teach trainees to sing, dance, and sometimes even speak foreign languages to communicate with their audiences. So if you haven't been formally taught but show some adeptness for the first two skills, that may be all you need to pass your audition.

, If you audition to be in an entertainment company such as SM Town, JYP, or YG, you will be asked to dance. If you can't dance, be honest and upfront about it. Some K-Pop artists, like Lee Hi, don't dance at all. However, being a great dancer is always a plus, so if you have a natural talent for dance, work with a coach or on your own to hone it into a marketable skill.

, Lots of K-Pop stars eventually do some sort of acting - either in music videos or in actual dramatic productions. While your singing and dancing talents should come first, a strong ability to act can be a serious boon during your audition. Consider hiring an acting tutor or getting involved in local theater productions to nurture your budding acting talent., K-Pop singers often sing English lyrics without having a fluent understanding of English, but the same can't be said for K-Pop's mother tongue. For a realistic chance at becoming a K-Pop star, you'll need, at the very least, a passable knowledge of the language. This will take lots of time and effort if you're starting from scratch and may require you to spend money on a tutor, various educational computer programs, or language courses. At first, you may be able to get by knowing only some basics and a few songs.

, There are many companies active in the Korean entertainment industry that boast their own K-Pop stars, but SM, JYP, YG, Cube, LOEN, Pledis, Woolim and BigHit are among the most famous. All companies have their own goals that can differ from who gets a callback and who doesn't. For example, SM Entertainment is colloquially said to to look for people who are pretty or handsome, JYP chooses based on looks and talent equally, and YG chooses based more on talent than on looks. You may want to take these rumors into account when scheduling your auditions.

, Believe it or not, K-Pop auditions occur throughout the world. Most are traditional - that is, you perform in front of judges - but you can even get noticed with a YouTube audition! Additionally, there are talent shows like K-Pop Star (a show where, appropriately, three judges find a K-Pop star) that may allow you to audition.

, However, whether they were actually born in the country or not doesn't matter so much. This preference isn't due to racism, rather it's because Korean beauty expectations are usually fulfilled by, of course, Koreans. Perhaps a more likely explanation for the lack of non-Asians is that because Kpop is a relatively new industry and has only picked up Western attention in the last few years, not many Westerners have ever tried to get into the industry., Presentation is everything! When you audition, don't wear clothes that are bizarre or off-putting. For instance, you shouldn't wear the types of clothes that you might wear to a rowdy party. Instead, wear something elegant and dignified that compliments your natural good looks. Something as simple as jeans and a normal shirt can be enough if you look good in it!


Use light makeup if you plan on wearing any. The judges want to see your natural beauty, so don't go overboard!

, Success can be elusive, but don't be discouraged! Keep going to auditions until you make it if you're passionate about getting into Kpop. Don't let a few fruitless auditions dissuade you. Persistence pays off.

Learn to recognize the following characteristics of healthy vocal technique:

It does not hurt your larynx (voice box).,
Get a good voice teacher.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing1,"
It makes notes on each end of your range more accessible.
It helps you sing in tune.
It empowers you to sing longer without fatigue.
It is based on low breathing, and thinking a constant line of air.
It uses word images to help you naturally access good placement without the tension which comes from trying to manipulate various parts of the anatomy directly.
It tires the brain, but not the voice.
It will train you to recognize your good singing apart from mere sound (since acoustics are variable and deceptive) by bodily sensation plus visual cues in the mirror.
It will not push the chest voice (where most people speak) into an uncomfortable or range (where the physics work against you, producing tension), but uses the head voice for higher notes.
It connects from the head voice downward to make a seamless and large vocal range that matches from top to bottom, possibly using the downward siren to teach this element.
It produces volume (loudness) from breath equilibrium, facial vitality, and vowel shape, never from forcing.
It helps young voices develop healthy singing habits but doesn't push them to sound like adults in volume or timbre.
It provides clear, attainable, stepwise objectives, so you know what is expected and how to get there.
It uses positive instruction and affirmation, not discouragement.
Following it gives you a good chance of singing better at age 50 than you did at age 21.;
, There are many limits to learning vocal technique from online advice:

A good voice teacher teaches each student a bit differently based on their needs and the way they respond to his directives. Though you can learn some basics from ""reading up"" or videos online, the approach will not be tailored to your needs. If you really must use only online material, then you should read many sources, using only those that work for you.
Many who give vocal advice online are not accredited teachers, and may be entirely untrained in healthy singing technique and teaching strategies. Professional vocal teachers will differ in how they approach the voice, and the style of singer they hope to produce. Find a teacher that is a good match for your desires and learning style.
If possible, seek one in the music department at a good university. Many music theater singers are taught to push the chest voice fairly high. If you take from a music theater professor, check with them about how they teach regarding the chest voice. In either department, ask around to see who is producing the best students, and ask if you may audition for them. Another option is to seek out excellent singers with music degrees, such as school teachers, who take a few students. If possible, attend a recital or master class to get a glimpse of their results.
If you are under age 18, enroll in choral music at your school, especially if the music teacher has a degree in vocal music. Start learning piano now, because the best voice teachers only take students who play well enough to learn their own songs without help. Piano instruction is more important than vocal instruction for anyone under age 18 who wants to be a singer.

Start off by singing a few scales.,
Do elevator slides.,
Sing along to a playlist.",How to Avoid Getting Cracks in Your Voice When Singing1," A scale is a sequence of musical notes that either ascend or descend in pitch. Most scales are based around octaves, which are 8 notes that are each a half or whole step apart (do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do).Sing scales so that you can loosen up your tight, firm vocal chords. This will enable you to gain control and flexibility., An elevator slide is a warm up technique that allows you to travel from head voice to chest voice and back in a smoother way that prevents cracking. To do this, start singing the vowel “e” on a low note and then make a siren-like sound as you move to higher and higher notes. Then, go back down to the note you started on.

After this, do the same exact thing, but with an “ah” sound instead., Make a list of four or five different songs you really enjoy singing. Then, rank them according to difficulty. Make a playlist that starts with the easier songs and ends with the harder ones. Warm up by singing each song on the playlist. By the time you get to the more challenging songs, your vocal chords should be more flexible and ready."
"
Space out your singing engagements or long rehearsals to have at least one day between.

,
Don't clear your throat (ahem) with that grating of vocal folds against each other.,
Don't whisper to preserve your voice.,If you are vocally sore, get a pad and paper and put yourself on vocal rest.,
Stop smoking (or don't start).

,Avoid using the glottal stop in your speech and singing.,
If allergies plague you, consider allergy testing or adjusting your diet or environment to alleviate them.,
If you are a cheerleader, have your voice teacher train you to shout correctly.,When laughing, don't let sound continue on the inhale.,
Don't imitate the Wicked Witch of the West.,
If you do theater, get the volume for your voice to carry in a healthy way.,
Don't speak in the gravelly basement part of your voice.,
Use decongestants and anti-histamines wisely.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing2,", Instead, drink plenty of water to thin mucus, which is a natural lubricant for vocal folds.Use an expectorant when needed to cough efficiently and gently after a cold. You needn't clear all mucus off the vocal folds in order to sing. With good breathing technique, you can sing through the phlegm, and no one farther away than 3 feet (0.9 m) will hear it, though you hear it rattle inside your head., Whispering is actually worse than shouting.

,,,, Many people respond to milk by an increase in mucus production. If you know you are singing in the afternoon, it may be worthwhile to use almond milk in the morning instead of real dairy.

, In general, avoid shouting. Cheer in a crowd by applause or whistling at games, etc.,, If you do voice-overs, use good sense in how you produce different characters., If you can't get that volume without yelling and straining, your voice is probably not really mature enough to do theater that is unaided by miking.

, Use voice inflection and nuance to keep a lilt in the voice, especially if you must use it often, as in teaching. If you are timid, raising the pitch of your speaking voice a little will help you sound more confident., If one of them makes you hoarse, find something better. For some people, taking 4 alfalfa tablets 3x per day is one acceptable alternative to other medications.

Jelly Belly: Put your hand on your belly at navel level to monitor movements.,
Puffing P's: With hand still monitoring belly movement, try some explosive p sounds, letting the p come from the belly area.,
Panting Dog: Keeping in mind the low feel for your breathing source, open your mouth, let your tongue hang out, and keeping everything relaxed in jaw and throat, do puffs of air from your ab, training yourself to think low in the body and keep the throat uninvolved in the process of air intake.,
The Catch-Breath: At the end of a phrase, expel or express the final consonant well to create a springboard-type energy that enables your next breath to pop in naturally as you let the abdominal muscles relax.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing3," When breathing, you ideally should let the gut drop, relaxed like a big, fat, jelly belly. Though the belly is lower than the diaphragm, letting organs hang out for the breath makes more room for it to descend and gives you a feeling of relaxation and energy. Blow air out. Each time you breathe, let the dropping of the gut create the vacuum that sucks air in for you. You do not have to suck in air, just open up and let it come in. Check shoulders to see that they are hanging naturally back and relaxed, not jerking upwards during breathing., As you ""p-"", the abdomen should naturally press itself inward with the puff of air.

,, It enables a quick breath centered low in the body, setting you up well for the next phrase.

"
Siren: Breathing low in the body, start in a place high in your voice but not uncomfortable, and on ""ah,"" siren downward.,
5-Note Slide: Start this exercise just like the slide, but slide from 5 down to 1, (i.e.G down to C), sliding through the notes.,
Hawaiian Guitar: In the song you are learning, sing through the notes in a phrase or part of a phrase on your favorite vowel, or after some experience, on the vowels of the lyrics, sliding from one note to another just like your siren exercise.,
Vowels Only: After sliding through the pitches, try to sing the actual notes on either one vowel or the vowels of the lyrics, but don't change the feel in your body and face from when you were sliding.,
Clustering Consonants (to the beginning of each word.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing4," This is a siren, not singing. Don't try to make it pretty. Just make it very connected, the same vowel all the way through, all of the sound smoothly sliding, with no breaks in the sound. The sound rides on the breath, so the breath must be steady. You will use less volume of air for this exercise than the breathing exercises above, which are exaggerated for purpose of defining the breathing method. If there are spots where breaks want to come in your siren, start a little above the spot and make your siren move more slowly through that area. Do not rush anything in this exercise. Take time to prepare your breath, and when you run out of breath, take time to get another well-seated breath before continuing the slide down. Imagine a line of sound coming from your mouth moving to or through the wall to keep the vowel siren steady. Make sure you have plenty of room in your mouth for the ""ah"" as if pleasantly surprised, but NOT yawning. You may try this on different vowels. Remember it is not singing. Slide through all the notes, but don't sing it like a scale. Many singers find this the most effective exercise for connecting the voice to the breath and getting a seamless sound throughout their range., Now sing the actual notes, but don't change anything in your body mechanism. Keep the face just as open, air just as flowing, etc. Move the 5 notes up or down the scale to warm up your voice. Take time to feel the center of your breathing (belly) before beginning each 5-note phrase. Don't rush., Take breaths more often than you would in singing it straight through, each breath low in the body. You are teaching your body to connect all the notes to the body and breath with a feeling of constant fluidity. Gradually try it faster. Consistent practice of this method integrates correct breathing into your muscle memory for the song you are working on.,, Vowels are the clothesline, and consonants are the clothespins. They intersect the line, but they don't stop it or cut it in two. Your consonants and diphthong vowels should occur at the last moment and be springboards for the next traveling vowel. They are liquid and supportive of the vocal line. Think a stretch through them from low in the body.You can re-think phrases in the following manner, first made popular by Robert Shaw to have a great vocal line in your singing: Written text=Don't know when I've felt so blue... Sung text = doh ntnoh wheh nah eevfeh ltsoh bloo. In other words, you are placing the ending consonant of the previous word onto the next word in the phrase. It works for some people as a nice little trick to get you singing a steady vocal line."

Say it, sing it: Looking in the mirror, say a phrase you want to sing in your best expressive speaking voice.,
Upward slide: Try this exercise only if you can successfully breathe from the body and do the downward slide.,
Sneeze: Imagine a tickling feeling inside behind your nose and eyes similar to what you feel right before you sneeze.,
Pointy Triangle: This works well, especially for many women.,
Vowel Columns: Each vowel has a top part and a bottom part, visualized like a column of air or an organ pipe.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing5," Then sing it, but don't change your mouth shape. This is best done in a medium low vocal range. It help you find a vowel that sounds alive. If you know you have a poor speaking voice and lazy vowels, it may help you to pretend you are someone else you know who has a good speaking voice. Singing right after saying it helps you find your natural vowel shape and avoid pitfalls of having the mouth too closed or unnaturally wrenched open for singing., Let your mouth and throat be loose. Get a body breath and do a loose, very slidy siren on ""ah"" oozing slowly upward. Keep the breath moving, and let it move faster as you go higher in pitch. The impetus of the increased air should naturally make your face want to open up to make room for more air. Let the face do that. While most people will not open up enough for their high notes by intuition, most people's faces will open up for them on this exercise. It becomes a gauge by which you can find how open your vowel must be and how much air it must ride on to sing with ease in the high range., Sing your vowels with that added tickle behind them. This is one way to get a clear, ringing sound in your vowels., Think of a triangle with a very small point at the peak behind the bridge of your nose. Let this triangle be there as you sing., If you sing with the vowel well-formed behind the eyes but not seated on the low-body breathing mechanism, you are lacking the low part, and vice versa. You want to feel the whole length of every vowel, both the ringing part behind the eyes and the settled part within the body. In the upper ranges, you may feel more lift of air behind the vowel, but it should still be a column, though the column may seem to have a point on the top. Feel like you are letting each vowel bloom into its full shape. (See, how important word images are to vocal instruction? If you hate word images, you may want to pursue some other hobby than vocal music.)"

Relax your muscles.,
Use your diaphragm.,
Blend vocal registers.",How to Avoid Getting Cracks in Your Voice When Singing2," Many singers tend to tilt their heads up when they sing high notes and down when they sing low notes. These tense movements can strain your voice and even limit your range. Instead, always try to keep your throat and neck muscles relaxed when you sing.You may find that your voice cracks when you’re nervous. This is because your muscles are tense when you’re nervous.

, Many experience cracking because they’re singing from their throat instead of their diaphragm. Use your larger abdominal muscles when you sing, and don’t rely on the smaller ones in your throat. This will allow you to have more support while you sing and transition more freely between registers.


Train yourself to do this by practicing low breathing. To do this properly, expand your belly like a balloon when you take deep breaths., Vocal registers are different ways of producing sound. When you sing, your vocal folds look and vibrate differently when in different registers. Because of this, it’s hard to transition smoothly from one to another without cracking. Avoid cracking by training yourself to blend these registers.Head voice (the higher, lighter, sweeter register) and chest voice (the deeper, lower, more powerful register) are the more common vocal registers.
Beginners naturally sing lower notes in chest voice and higher notes in head voice. Practice singing lower notes in head voice and higher notes in chest voice to help ease the transition."

Drink a lot of water.,
Eat hydrating snacks.,
Avoid consuming alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar, or acidity.,
Avoid yelling and screaming.,
Don’t clear your throat.,
Humidify your home.,
Don’t smoke.",How to Avoid Getting Cracks in Your Voice When Singing3," When you drink water, your vocal chords are lubricated at a cellular level. This lubrication alleviates the stress to your vocal cords caused by heat and friction.Make sure you drink the recommended 6-8 8oz glasses a day, and keep a glass nearby when you’re singing.Make sure to drink lukewarm water while singing; anything too cold or too hot can negatively affect your voice.

, You can also hydrate yourself and lubricate your vocal cords by eating foods that contain a lot of water. Eat a good amount of apples, pears, watermelon, peaches, melons, grapes, plums, bell peppers and applesauce., Many foods and drinks have negative impacts on your voice, including: milk, juice, coffee, ice cream, and candy. Avoid these foods and drinks particularly on training and performing days., When you increase your loudness, your vocal folds bang together harder than usual to produce the sound. Over time, this can cause your vocal folds to become swollen, red, and damaged., While it might seem natural to clear your throat before singing, it bangs your vocal cords together in a destructive way that can lead to severe hoarseness. Instead, try sipping water when you feel the urge to clear your throat.

If you find yourself clearing your throat a lot, see a doctor. There’s a chance that you could be dealing with some allergies or acid reflux disease., Moisture is great for your voice. Put a humidifier in your room at night while you sleep to make sure that you’re breathing in environments that are most beneficial to your vocal chords., Smoking cigarettes can not only cause cancer, but also inflammation to your vocal cords. This inflammation can cause your voice to sound weak and husky."

Even if you consider yourself or have been told you are a good singer it is important to make sure you have the base singing skills necessary to be a singer. Find your singing range and practice singing regularly.If you have a lot of improvement that needs to be done or you just want to get your voice the best it can be, you might want to consider taking singing lessons. You can also use websites and phone apps to learn to sing.;
, In order to mimic the sound and learn the country style, practice by singing along to country artists you like who are in your vocal range. Women may want to listen to Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, Martina McBride, Carrie Underwood, Allison Krauss, and Kellie Pickler.
Men may want to listen to Hank Williams, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, George Jones, Rodney Atkins, and Toby Keith.

, Country singers have a specific sound to their voice. Whether you have the country twang naturally or not it is possible to learn to sing with a country style to your voice.


First try to put the country twang in your speaking voice. Mimic the country twang of singers, actors, and characters into your speaking.
Start singing with the twang by over exaggerating the sound of it. This will get the sound familiar on your voice. Once you have the feel of it down, tone it down. , This will help create your country sound and make song writing easier. If you really cannot learn you can have someone play while you sing and be a duo, but knowing how to play guitar is a major part of country singing.


The most important chords to learn for country music are G, C, D, and A. Country music is usually a combination of these chords. , There are plenty of country singers who cover other artist’s songs. Start by learning how to sing other country singers songs before you decide if you want to write your own music.

, There are various types of country music. There is traditional country western music that is simple and about real life issues. Bluegrass is similar to country western, except it is entirely acoustic. It uses acoustic instruments such as the upright bass fiddle, acoustic guitars, banjos, and fiddles. There is also a newer genre of country music called pop-country. Which is pop music with a country feel. , You can write about whatever you want, but country music does tend to follow some of the same basic topics. Country music is stories set to music. There is usually a plot and characters just like a story except it rhymes and has a melody.


Common topics for country songs are broken hearts, betrayal, Jesus, the Devil, Mama, feeling blue, the South (Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, etc.), death, love, cowboys, and words of wisdom. , Once you have decided the subject to write about you can write the lyrics to your country song. There are plenty of sad country songs but the feel good songs are usually the hits. Country music is very literal so keep the lyrics simple. They should tell a story about what is happening around you or about what you know.


Unlike pop, the chorus is the most important part of country music. Use a lot of adjectives in your lyrics to describe something. Don’t use swear words. Some genres use or even encourage using swear words, but not country music. , People are going to remember the melody of your song before they remember the lyrics. You can build your song around the melody but don’t let the melody control your lyrics. The melody is a very important part of a country song. Without a melody you can’t feel the song and nobody will care about your song. Country songs have very simple melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions. The basic chord progressions to write your melody to is typically G, C, D or G, D, A, or a combination of those chords. There is typically no need for any fancy chord progressions. , There are many ways you can record your song depending on your resources and budget. You could work with a technical savvy friend, book time with a professional studio engineer, or just record your song at home using a microphone and computer software. Whatever way you choose to record your song, having a copy of an audio recording will open up many doors. , You music is copyrighted from the moment it is created, but if someone steals your music it is not protected in a lawsuit unless you register it. As soon as you have a final version written and recorded you can register it online at the U.S. Copyright Office for a small fee. Once you do this the song is yours. No one can use the original material without your permission. If you don’t do this someone can steal the lyrics or melody and make a new recording of it. They won’t need your permission or have to pay you any royalties. , Examples of PROs are ASCAP, SESAC, and BMI. They will collect any royalties and distribute them to you in an organized fashion. If your song is ever played on TV, iTunes, YouTube, or Spotify, you are entitled to royalty. Some PROs are free and others have a fee. , This will take a while but today’s technology makes this faster than ever. You can send your demos and mixtapes out to try to get noticed.


Send your demos to journalists, promoters, or management. Include your name, phone number, email address, and website on every CD that you send out. This way whoever listens to your CD will be able to contact you if they like it, whether they have your packaging or not. Keep your packaging simple. A simple note about who you are and any gigs you have will be good enough. Look through the album sleeves of country artists you like to find labels and managers to send your demos to. There are websites available such as Showcase, The Unsigned Guide and CMU Directory to help find the name and address of people to send your demos to. , Many singers get discovered when they perform their music live. Start with your friends, family, and those you feel most comfortable with. Then perform your music in the small venues: open mics, talent shows, and café’s.


Use who you know to get gigs. Even asking your friends to perform at birthday parties is a step in the right direction.
Use the gigs you get to find more. If you make a good impression, promoters or someone in the audience might ask you to perform somewhere else.
Ask small local venues or event organizer if you can perform at their venue or event. Try going to them in person or call over the phone instead of sending an email. , In order to stand out you need a fanbase. You will need to work hard to get fans to notice your work but having fans will open up many doors.


Publish your songs online. Once you have a clear recording of your song and you have copyrighted it, publish it. It is easy for anyone to publish their song online. Put your music on YouTube or Soundcloud so other people can see your work.
Use social media to create fans. Use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media sites to get people to find you. Be active on social media and reach out to fans. Promote your music on your social media. Have an image. Be yourself but have something about you that makes you known. This can be wearing a certain outfit, having a certain hairstyle, or acting a certain way. Taylor Swift became famous for her blonde curls and Lady Gaga for her ostentatious outfits. These images helped them become well known. "

Milk the Words: Feel a stretchiness and languorous enjoyment of each word sound.,
Phrase Rainbows: Each phrase has a shape, and many are like rainbows, with a stretch to a climax in the middle, falling to resolution at the end.,
Meaning of the words: Create your own inner story of what is going on between the lines of the text.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing6," Enjoy them, like good saltwater taffy., Trace the shape of a rainbow in the air as you think these phrases, and it may help you sing them expressively. Other phrases look more like a waterslide or a straight line. Learn to think about the shape of your phrase and connect through it, expressing that shape in your impetus and dynamics.

, Then, let your body and face express this naturally by thinking that ""story line"" underneath your singing. In order to do this, you must often research the poetry for full understanding, and you must be well-prepared with your general song-learning to add this extra layer. Don't be too hasty in breaking the mood at the end of the song, but let it linger while you keep your eyes fixed on the same spot for a moment, as if the frame froze at the end of the movie. This will help the mood you have set to be quite powerful."

Ping pong on the blow dryer: Picture your singing as a state of equilibrium in which your vocal sounds ride on top of your steady flow of air.,
Rainbow breath gauge: In order to have enough air at the end of a phrase, think of tracing the phrase in the air as a rainbow, and this helps you know how much air you can spend at the beginning and still get to the end.,
Practice the end first: On long phrases you have determined need to be sung on one breath, practice the end without the beginning first.,
Conveyor belt: Think of your line of breath as being like a conveyor belt that never stops during the singing.,
Line of air: Think a steady line of air.,
Stretch through breaths: Sometimes we struggle to get back our equilibrium after stopping to breathe for the next phrase.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing7," If your air is a steady line with just the right amount of air volume, your singing will float along with the very best physics possible for the vibration of the vocal folds. Higher notes need a faster flow of air, but it is not a frantic, tension-filled increase, just a stretch into more connection.

,, Getting the body used to singing the end well with plenty of breath and without closing down or tension trains its muscle memory to find a good approach to this spot. Practicing it this way often before connecting the parts sets you up for success. But also, consider whether it's the better part of valor (wisdom) find a spot to breathe somewhere in it. No one will notice where you breathe if you make the breath part of the expression of the piece, make it as much a part of the music as the sung notes. But everyone will notice if you creak or turn blue on the last note.

,, Your singing all rides on this constant line. Depending on the style or range of the notes, you may have a silvery thin line or a thick line like a decorative fountain spurting up many columns. Learn to picture that steady line of air in your practice, and it will come naturally during performance.

, Think a body stretch through the breath, and it will leave you ready for the phrase, not disengaged."

Kitty Squeaks (children and women) and Owl Hoots (changed-voice males): these sounds can be used to help you locate the place behind the eyes within your head from which the highest notes should seem to come.,
Ping it, sing it: Use just enough air to touch or puff a staccato note for each note in a phrase.,
Behind the front teeth: Some singers find it helpful to picture their highest notes as a line of sound exiting the mouth from behind the two upper front teeth, or at the alveolar ridge.,
Favorite vowel approach: Many people have a vowel that seems to work best for them on high notes.,
Making a space: many different word images can help you create the lovely space in which your high notes need to resonate.,
Scooping in: When learning new literature, as you are sliding through it, it can be useful to slide into a high note from below, to help you connect the breath.,Sirening upwards as described above is great training for connected high notes.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing8," The kitty squeak helps women find their whistle voice range. Use a small puff of air to barely touch a whistle-like ah, ih, or ee. It is a short sound. You can pulse this sound on separated staccato notes til you find the place where it rings well and feels free. Immature or inexperienced singers may not be ready for this. Most males can easily find the Mickey Mouse-sounding falsetto by doing an owl hoot. Often oo or oh vowels help males locate the sweet spot for their high notes., This (if it works for you) may help set you up for the note to ride on the column of air and for the right vowel shape for each note. After gauging with the staccato puff, sing through the whole phrase, using what you learned.,, When learning a new high portion of a piece, try learning it on that vowel before switching to the real words., You may think of a snake face, with eyes bulging and jaw dropped, or a Disney heroine face, with wide, innocent eyes and a twinkle in them. Some like to think of the air flowing out of the top of their head, or an unraveling skein of yarn being pulled out from the top of their head., If it is an area where your chest (speaking) voice wants to go up uncomfortably high, however, then slide down to it instead.,"
"
Falling forward: Healthy low notes will feel like they are falling forward out of your mouth, not being ground up out of your larynx.,
Slow slide, fast slide: Start near to your low range and slide very slowly down to it, keeping the line of air and keeping an open vowel.,
Space in mouth: Many people who open up well for high notes mistakenly think they must shut the mouth for low notes.,
Dog muzzle: It helps some people to think singing into a dog muzzle on their face when they ease into their low range.,
Feel it in the chest: Though you don't want to make it drop into the chest, rather fall forward from the face, you may feel more vibration or warmth in your chest area when using the low range.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing9," They are connected to the air, and flow out like liquid out of one of those fountains that has water coming out of the mouth of a fish. Low notes are not grabbed, but nurtured and allowed to happen., Then, start higher and make your slide quicker, seeing if you can still maintain the connection and openness., This is not so. You must still provide space in the mouth and relax the jaw for low notes. The space behind the eyes may feel lower, however, as if behind the nose.,,"
"
If a certain vowel works well for you, try a difficult phrase singing it on that vowel to get you started approaching it.

,If a certain part in the song comes easily and another part is more difficult, sing the easy part first and sing the hard part immediately afterwards, while you are still in the easy vocal feel.,
Don't blaze through a whole song every time.,
Use a mirror to check for body breathing, facial aliveness, good vowel shapes, enough room in the mouth,...etc.,
When learning music, play a short phrase on the piano, then sing it, matching pitch.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing10,",, Take out pieces of it to work on in isolation, training your body to sing each piece well. Then gradually put them back together.

,, If you have recording software, it may occasionally be useful to record this process to see how close you are coming and identify pitch areas you need to slide through in order to center the vowel and breathing for truly stunning pitch accuracy.

"Come well-prepared so you don't let others down and strain your voice.,
Listen to others around you and blend, don't blast.,
Your own personal dynamics: Big voices in an ensemble may not be able to sing as softly as small voices.,
Vibrato: Some ensemble singing styles require the use of very subtle or even no vibrato.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing11,", Watch the conductor for tempo, dynamics, etc.

, When asked for a pianissimo, find your own pianissimo. If you can't become soft enough for the group without vocal tension, lay own on that part and come back in subtly when the volume increases. Same with small voices, don't push harder than is healthy when asked for fortissimo. Sing ""your"" fortissimo., If you have natural vibrato and want to sing in a straight-tone group, seek the help of a capable teacher to learn how to sing with a simpler tone. You may, however, want to seek out a group that uses a style you produce more easily.

"
"Intervals by sound and sight - If you don't read notes and hear intervals (the distance between two given notes) in your head, you should seek help for ear-training if you want to be a capable singer.,
Rhythm - reading notes well enough to sing the rhythm accurately is also important.

,
Chords and understanding harmony - to sing like a professional, you need to sense which part of the chord you are singing.,
Independence, dissonance - Learn to hold your pitch even when things compete or distract, such as a next-door-neighbor who sings flat in your ear.,
Counterpoint - Some choral styles are an interweaving of stacked melodies.",How to Avoid Vocal Damage When Singing12,",, This takes an understanding of harmony which is best learned, as are both of the above, by getting a good background in piano., Try singing a familiar song with musical friends each a half-step apart from the others key-wise. If you practice such things, you'll be ready for contemporary choir pieces that have dissonance as their main expressive element, and you'll probably ace auditions where you have to sight-read in an ensemble group., Your director should let you know which voice should be at the forefront, and which ones are to lie back and let it predominate. You will win the esteem of your director if you mark in your part what they've said and be careful to do it."

First, consider what type of punk you're in the mood for.,
Consider pop-punk.,
Decide whether to include anarcho-punk.,
Consider Hardcore-punk or Hardcore.,
Think about skate-punk.,
Debate over whether to use Street Punk or Oi!.,
Dive into other sub-genres.,
Gather your raw material.,
Look for music on dedicated music sites.,
Use YouTube to find music.,
Find new music on Spotify.,
Using the Genius application through iTunes.,
Start constructing your playlist.,
Choose your songs.,
Order your playlist.",How to Make a Punk Playlist," Ska has a very different feel from anarcho-punk, and your mood might dictate which sub-genre you want on your playlist. Remember punk is a very large genre that encompasses a lot of ground, so learn about the most popular sub-genres, including their history, their most well-known artists, what subjects or issues they deal with, and the general character of their sounds. Decide which sub-genres to include in order to achieve your overall sound.;
, This is one of the more common sub-genres and is most often identifiable by its happier tone, even though the song might be about sad things such as family trouble, relationship breakdowns, or day-to-day struggles for middle-class youth. Note this is a different type of angst than those in other sub-genres of punk. Examples of Pop Punk include Blink-182, The Offspring and Green Day.

, This sub-genre is very close to the original punk genre and is characterized by its often nihilistic attitude. Members of anarcho-punk bands will often be anarchists and will sing about trying to revolt against capitalism or overthrow the corruption that is apparent with the current government structure. This genre is not for the lighthearted and as such is probably not good for a party mix. Examples of anarcho-punk are The Sex Pistols, Discharge, or Propagandhi.

, This is a step up in terms of aggression. Rather than dealing with issues such as politics, hardcore often tends to deal with more violent topics, such as war, racism on the streets, anti-police mentality, and the like. It is defined by its often extremely abrasive sound, and it mixes in lots of breakdowns with high distortion. Examples of Hardcore include Minor Threat, Bad Brains, The Dead Kennedys or Agnostic Front.

, Skate punk is another well known genre that had a lot of interest during the late 90's. It is often extremely fast, with fast-paced drums and stories of running from cops, skating till the death, and other anecdotes common amongst skaters. It often has some extremely short songs, even under the 30 second mark. A few good examples of skate-punk are NOFX, Suicidal Tendencies, Strung Out, and Pennywise.

, These two sub-genres revolve around the issues faced by the working class, with the expressed intention of Oi! being to unite skinheads, other punks and the working class. Most of the lyrical content revolves around the conflicts and struggle of the day-to-day life in the working class, and are often very nihilistic or jaded. Some street-punk bands are The Casualties, The Distillers and Street Dogs. A few Oi! bands are The Discocks, Blitz, Anti-Heros and some of the early Dropkick Murphys.

, There are so many genres under the punk umbrella, including some extremely odd ones, like electropunk or harsh noise, so make sure to explore. Punk is a mixed bag so feel free to experiment to your taste, and don't feel the pressure to like all of it. Pick and choose freely what you want and make your own inferences about what styles suit you and your outlook.

, Now that you've chosen an overall tone for your playlist, you need to find material for it. There are a wide variety of websites that can help you find material to add into a playlist and are easily accessible. Don't worry yet about choosing the perfect mix of songs; instead, focus on finding artists and songs that fit the overall tone of your playlist. Come up with a list of possibilities, and you can later narrow it down from there.

, Use websites like last.fm, which allows people to tag music and as such has an extremely large variety of bands under each genre tag. Simply use the search function to search for the punk genre that you are looking for and you'll have a wide variety of bands to check out at your finger tips. Unfortunately due to copyright issues, not a lot of music is hosted on the website.

, YouTube is a great resource in this regard because it can allow you to find a lot of material that people have uploaded for you to stream for free regardless of your location. Some larger conglomerates, such as Vevo, may not allow you to stream music from certain artists in odd locations. At this time, there is no known way around this, so make sure to not just narrow your searching to an artist's official channel.

, Spotify is another great location to search for music, and the even better side of it is that it even gives a tiny bit of revenue to the artist themselves. This may definitely help a local struggling punk band so it's a really good way to aid groups that are struggling to find their footing in the chaotic world of music.

, Genius is a program within the iTunes framework which identifies music that is listed similarly on the iTunes Store. Whilst in principle, it is quite good, the limitations of the iTunes Store genre system leads to genre overlap, which is a bit irritating if you're trying to find one specific style.

, Now that you've found a variety of artists, you can decide on what you want in the playlist. Consider questions like ""Do I want whole albums?"", ""Do I only want popular singles?"", and ""Do I want a consistent sound?"" This will help you set parameters when beginning to construct your playlist, and you can use these parameters to narrow down large list of artists and songs you found earlier.

, Take music from the bands that you found previously, or choose other songs. Remember that a coherent playlist keeps a similar feel, so think about this when choosing your songs. This means that you could add certain pop-punk songs in with skate-punk songs because they have a similar energy. This will also make your playlist feel a lot more fulfilling, or consistent, as opposed to a mismatched hodgepodge of jumping tempos and levels of aggression.

, Once you've chosen your songs, arrange them in order. You can do a lot of things with the way you order your playlist: use it to tell a story by following songs with others that flow naturally, emotionally or literally, from the first. Use it to evoke certain emotional responses in the listener or create a particular atmosphere. Intersperse a sequence of songs with one tone with one or two of another - for instance, one slow, melancholy song in the middle of several happy, upbeat songs - to draw out certain emotions or feelings or create a stronger mood.

Research the station and save the station’s phone number into your phone.
Most radio shows even have a page on their site that lists the recent or most play songs. This will give you a sense of what music they prefer and if your request is relevant.;
, Some people go through the steps and when it’s time to request a track, they freeze up and waste their call. Have a few songs prepared in case the station doesn’t have your first choice.Make sure your song selections match the genre or theme of the radio station you’ve decided on.

, Listen to the radio station for a while before requesting your song. This will help you in case the song is played before you have a chance to request it.


About a half hour later, you could try to call the station number.

, You may get a busy signal, so hang up and try again until you reach the station’s operator. Usually you’ll speak to someone who will screen you before talking to the DJ.


Speak clearly into the phone.

, Some radio stations will broadcast your request over the air. They may ask you where you are from, the station you are listening to, and your name.


Refrain from using inappropriate language or else your song request will not be honored.

, More and more stations set up an electronic form to request a song. The form will typically ask for your name, email, location, and information about what type of music you like. Fill these out to best of your ability.Depending on the radio station, you will receive information about the request you submitted. Some stations won’t send you any information about your request.
Fill out several forms and hope for a response.

Compliment the DJ.,
Know the song name before chatting.,
Listen to the station.",How to Request a Song on the Radio3," Nobody will want to play your request if you comment “you never play good songs so please play Hounds of Love by Kate Bush.” Instead you could compliment them for a specific hour you heard last Thursday after work. If you follow the latter with a song request, your chances are higher of being honored., Getting in touch with a DJ for a request is not the easiest process these days. Have respect for the DJ and know the name of the song.Do not sing or say something like, “it’s the song that goes “nah de dah nah; hey hey hey.” They aren’t taking your call to be quizzed.

, After going through your steps in requesting a song just listen to the station. Part of letting listeners request a song is a ploy for radio stations to gather more listeners.


Be patient and if your song doesn’t play, don’t sweat it. Try again if you still have the urge.

Listen to the transitions.,
Test it out.",How to Make an Awesome Music Playlist," Making a playlist will depend on what software you're using to play music, whether online, on a mobile device, or on your computer. Making a playlist usually involves a simple drag-and-drop style of moving songs into the list, or you can select individual song files, right-click, and send them to the list. Start by making a blank list, then filling it with music you might like to include in a playlist to learn how it works.


Programs like Spotify and iTunes make creating playlists an easy and almost essential part of the music-listening experience. Project Playlist, Take 40, Windows Media Player, Grooveshark are also all good programs for managing your music.
Pandora and other Internet radio stations let you create channels, but not specific playlists of songs.;
, Get music by typing the name of any song, band or artist you like. You can also search just general types of music or artists to find new music or check out what your friends or other users on the site are listening to.


If you're using iTunes, you can either select music that's already in your library, which you own, or you can search the store and download any song you find for a price.
If you've got iTunes, but no music, you can also upload your CDs into iTunes to ""rip"" the music directly. Going to the public library and loading the music into your iTunes library can be a great way of acquiring songs to make playlists on the cheap.

, Mobile devices also allow you to create playlists instantaneously, by selecting songs and sending them to a playlist, or selecting ""Play next,"" making you an instant DJ. You don't need to make playlists ahead of time, you just need to go with the flow.

, Start with your favorite music genre first and add your favorite songs from a mixture of artists in that genre. The ultimate hip-hop playlist, classic rock playlist, and baroque classical playlist are all great ways of organizing your tunes.


Equally great is to pick a single artist to start with. If you've got all the records Bob Dylan ever recorded, that's a lot of tunes to sift through. Pick your 50 favorite songs from his career and organize them into a playlist of the greats.
Alternatively, while it might make sense to stick to one genre, you don't have to. Try jumping all over the place. Throw some prog-jazz or some classical-folk-gothic fusion into the mix. Why not? There are no rules except what sounds good to you.

, Playlists offer you a great opportunity to be like a curator at a museum, or like a DJ who tells a story with songs. Pick a mood, theme, or idea from which to organize your playlist. Make a playlist made of songs that all have ""black"" in the title, or a playlist of only love songs. Be creative. Some possibilities might include:


Break-up songs
Monday morning songs
Working songs
Headphone songs
Aggressive songs
Trippy songs

, Another great way of creating a playlist is thinking about what you'll use the music for. Most music fans will want to listen to very different types of music at the gym, on a date, and when you're trying to relax at night. Create playlists and pick music that will fit each occasion. Some good occasion playlists might be:


Working out
Driving to work
Summer barbecue
Dance party
Meditation or relaxation

, Try making a playlist in which you pick songs you listened to during your Freshman year, or that you remember hearing on the radio when you were a kid. Make a playlist of songs you always remember your dad listening to, or songs you remember hearing on your way to after-school sports practice. Pick the songs that remind you of your best friend. Making a playlist is a great way of staying in touch with the past.


Try to tell a story with your playlist. How might you sum up your entirely middle school experience in ten songs? Give it a shot.

, Many an awkward teenager has successfully wooed a date with a tastefully curated mix of love songs, and many an amateur DJ has packed the dancefloor with a properly selected group of dance jams. Consider the points of reference, the tastes, and the opinions of the people who'll be listening to the playlist, if anyone. If it's for you, just worry about what you like!

, Organize playlists around getting all the songs into a certain theme or era. For instance, you might create a playlist of the Top 100 Billboard songs from 1967, or a playlist of the complete Beatles songs. If you want, you could make a huge playlist of all the records that are on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Or make you own countdown list for fun.

, The great thing about most apps and websites is that you can put the songs on shuffle, edit your playlist and add new music even when you're done, so you don't have to worry about the order yet. Nothing is set in stone, like on a CD or a mixtape. Start dumping all the songs you're considering including on the playlist in and worry about sorting them out later.


Alternatively, you could go with the mixtape approach, and go one song at a time, carefully selecting the movement of the playlist. This is especially good for dance mixes of headphones mixes.

, Whatever your theme, genre, or taste, one thing about playlists is universal: it's got to start with a great song. Lead off with a song that'll hook everyone who'll listen, or will kick off your personal favorites playlist with a bang.Alternatively, maybe the order of the songs is predetermined (as in a countdown playlist) or maybe you're just not interested in a carefully selected order for the songs. Consider randomizing the order by hitting shuffle, or by tossing the songs in alphabetically for easy access. This tends to be easier for very long playlists.

, In most cases, you'll want an awesome playlist to vary the mood, the tempo, and the tones in the music somewhat, or else it'll get repetitive and dull. Even if you're making a Best of Black Metal playlist, try to throw some more atmospheric headbangers in there, or it'll be hard to follow.


Alternatively, a party playlist should probably only go up, so start with a banger and progressively get rowdier. Likewise, a go-to-sleep playlist should stay relatively sedate. Let it fade off into white noise or silence at the ending.

, Some songs have abrupt endings while others will have gradual fade-outs or codas. Some rock songs end with long blasts of feedback, while other songs will Listen to how each song transitions into the next.


Avoid aural schizophrenia. It's nice to have some variety, but going straight from Slayer to Simon and Garfunkel will sound strange. It's your playlist, but try to make the order relatively smooth. Slayer to Led Zeppelin's ""Since I've Been Loving You"" to Simon and Garfunkel? That's more like it.

, You can put your playlist on your phone, iPod, CD or any other portable music device like a flash drive and take it out with you on a run, or to the gym, or to the party where you want to dance and try it out. Delete songs that don't work and add songs that enhance the experience that you're soundtracking. If that Cat Stevens song wasn't as relaxing as you wanted it to be, delete it and go softer. It's easy to make changes.

Create your own playlists on Songza.,
Use Spotify to access thousands of songs for free.,
Make music playlists on YouTube.",How to Listen to Music Online2," Songza is another Internet radio site, but it has a different model and interface than Pandora or iHeartRadio. It allows users to create their own playlists that can be shared, and offers suggestions based on theme rather than song or artist.

To access Songza, go to http://www.songza.com/. When you enter the site, Songza will ask you a series of questions in order to recommend playlists for you, known as the “Music Concierge”. For example, based on the time of day, it might give you a choice among music for “work or study”, “an energy boost”, or “a weekday dance party”. Then you can pick a specific genre, and finally a playlist based on your preferences. When you select a playlist, it will begin playing.
Alternatively, you can skip the Music Concierge process by clicking “Today's Biggest Hits” or “Brand New Music” in the middle of the page. “Today's Biggest Hits” will take you to a list of the most popular playlists, which you can adjust to cover today, the past week, or the past year.

You can create a playlist by clicking ""+ New Playlist"". Then, search for songs and drag them over to your playlist on the left-hand side.

, YouTube is good if you are looking for a specific song. The program will often have a number of different versions of a song, some higher quality than others. Usually, you will get the best quality if you can find the official music video version of the song, but you should still be able to find a good version even if there is no official version.


Go to https://www.youtube.com/ and use the search bar to search for a song or artist. For popular artists, YouTube usually has an option when you search for an artist called a YouTube mix. This will be on the right side of the screen. It's a playlist of that artist's most popular songs.
One of the downsides of YouTube is that, normally, you have to manually switch videos every time a song ends.

To make one, click on the ""Playlists"" header at the top of iTunes, click on the small gray cross in the bottom left corner, then choose ""New Smart Playlist.""


Smart playlists can make a list of all the music you've added that month, every one of your top rated ""jazz"" songs, only songs with high quality audio, your most played songs, and more.

, The smart playlist window allows you to tell iTunes where to find the music you want. From here, you can choose the parameters for your playlist:


The first box chooses how to organize you playlist (album, artist, genre, file size, etc.)
The second box defines the parameter, (contains the phrase, is not, etc)
The third box let's you input what songs you want to choose from.
For example, if I want a playlist of all songs by ""The Who,"" I would select ""Artist"" in the first box, ""Contains"" in the second, and then write ""The Who"" in the third. This means the playlist will contain all songs by the artist, ""The Who.""

, This lets you chose songs by genres, plays, date added, bit rate -- you name it. You can make as many parameters as you'd like and iTunes automatically sorts your songs.

, For example, if you want to add The Who, but don't want any of the songs off of the album ""Tommy,"" you can click ""..."" and choose ""Album,"" ""Does Not Contain"" and write in ""Tommy.""

, Otherwise the playlist will just choose random songs.

Ask yourself what types of music you like. If you can give your friends a few songs and bands, it will be easier for them to suggest similar bands.;
, Pandora creates unique radio stations based on your preferences. Google Music finds songs based on mood and activity. Spotify has a series of recommendations based on past listening history. The amount of code written to help people find new music is staggering -- making it easier than ever. You just have to provide a few of your personal favorites to get things started.


Many playback programs, like iTunes, offer recommendation services as well. On iTunes, this is through the ""Genius"" setting., Live music is often an unknown band's best chance to earn new fans. Going out to real shows is an incredible way to expand your musical library, and you can often meet the bands or pick up merchandise as well. Going to live music lets you feel out songs in real time, as well as get in touch with great, up and coming bands that would be almost impossible to find online.

All genres of music borrow from others. From the ""rock opera"" and oldies-sampling hip-hop beats to the reggae/punk lovechild known as ""ska,"" you'd be surprised how often influences from dissimilar genres bleed over.

"
Recognize and listen for repetition and variation.,
Think carefully about the tone, mood, and feel of the music.,
Listen in for specific instruments, noting how the parts come together to form a greater whole.,
Think about the song's movement, or progression.,
Search for any crucial outside context about the track.,
Build up your musical concentration for longer pieces.",How to Listen to Music2," There is very often also something new very near the end. Locate passages that you find especially rewarding. Are these passages repetitions, variations, or new? If they are variations, can you realize what it was that was varied? More importantly -- why is a certain section being repeated at all? Is it because the melody is great, or to make a point with the lyrics?



Melody is simply a collection of notes, like the beginning of ""Seven Nation Army"" or the vocal notes repeated in a chorus. A catchy melody, is usually the key to whether or not a song catches on.

Harmony is the collection of notes played at any one time. Some people think of it as ""vertical,"" whereas melody is ""horizontal."" How do multiple voices, instruments, and notes come together in one instant to harmonize, or sound great on top of one another?, What are the intangible feelings the song gives? Start simply -- is it happy, or sad? Do the instruments sound bright and bouncy, or thoughtful and somber? What sort of scene to you imagine the song being played over -- rainy, sunny, joyous, thoughtful, heartbroken, etc. Some terms to keep in mind include.



Colors: It may be hard to see color in sound, but close your eyes. Imagine the song is in a movie scene -- what is the dominant mood or color of that scene?

Balance: How many instruments are playing at once? Is it spare and sparse, the beginning of ""Hey Jude?"" Or is it big, bold, and filled with noise, like the end of ""Hey Jude?""

Texture: A guitar can be ""chunky"" or ""smooth,"" a trumpet solo can be ""silky"" or ""abrasive."" Mostly this comes from the rhythm -- are their long, well-held, smooth notes, or are they all short, choppy, and distorted?, Notice things in the bass that seem alive, pregnant with meaning, or just sound cool. Notice the kinds of changes that happen at your favourite moment. Does the melody soar into an unfamiliar accent? Does a new rhythm add pungency? Does a buzz suddenly splinter into a fractured collision of noise and excitement?

, Does the song end up in the same, or a similar, place as where it started? Or does it tell a story, moving and evolving so that the singer feels ""changed"" from beginning to end. Both are viable types of songwriting, but both tell very different stories. If the song does seem to change, ask yourself how the singer and musicians made the ""argument."" At what point is there a shift in the overall idea or feel of the music?


The key change in ""Hey Jude"" is one of the most important, and famous, instances of movement and change in pop music. In an instant, the song goes from somber and thoughtful to joyous and intense.

, Songs are not written in a vacuum -- and sometimes stepping into the context of a song suddenly makes the lyrics make sense. For example:Eric Clapton's ""Tears in Heaven"" gains even more power when you know it is about his tragically deceased son.
Kendrick Lamar's ""Blacker the Berry"" is a searing personal letter written right after Trayvon Martin was murdered. If you do not know the huge political and social ramifications of that case then the song likely falls on deafer ears., Getting into jazz, classical, prog rock, or any other musical form with 10 minute songs, is daunting. Don't worry if you get distracted or even a little bored at first -- it is only natural. But push yourself to focus on each section on repeat listens. Composing these pieces is no mistake, and the composer is trying to fill the time and pull you along with the song at every second. While they might not always succeed, work on focusing throughout the whole song. You'll be surprised at the subtle, exciting bits and pieces you pick up.Try out Duke Ellington's ""Diminuendo in Blue,"" to get started. It is long, but high-energy and exciting throughout, with well repeated themes and melodies.

Hardcore is harsh, fast, and aggressive punk rock music. While that’s part of the point of listening to hardcore punk, learning how to approach the music correctly will let you enjoy it without accidentally giving yourself a headache.


Sometimes called “pop punk” because of the catchy choruses and hooks, bands like Green Day, NOFX and Social Distortion can be good intros to the genre of punk rock if you’re not already familiar with listening to punk.
Alternatively, just dive right in the deep end of the genre and see whether or not hardcore is right for you. After all, it’s just music with guitars, drums, and vocals. It can’t hurt you.;
, Contemporary hardcore is a diverse umbrella of music, enveloping lots of subcategories: screamo/skramz, post-hardcore, D-Beat, grindcore, powerviolence. It can be hard to tell one thing from the next. If you want to get into hardcore, though, starting with the early practitioners of the sound is the best way to introduce yourself to the music and see whether or not you like it.While any list is incomplete, these albums will give you a solid veteran perspective on the genre:


Black Flag - Damaged, My War, Nervous Breakdown
Minor Threat – Minor Threat
Negative Approach - Tied Down
Cro-Mags - The Age of Quarrel
The Misfits - Walk Among Us, Static Age, Earth A.D., Legacy of Brutality
Bad Brains - Bad Brains
The Circle Jerks - Group Sex, Wild In The Streets
D.O.A - Something Better Change, War on 45, Hardcore '81

, Once you've listened to the classics, it's good to check out more contemporary iterations of hardcore music. There are bands staying true to the vibe of the original hardcore masters, bands like OFF!, which is fronted by the former Black Flag and Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris, while younger bands like Converge and Nails have taken hardcore to brutal new heights. Increasingly, hardcore sounds have mixed with metal and other forms of extreme music to fuel all sorts of other hybrid genres. While the categories aren't by any means rigid, and many of the bands might disagree with the following categories, here's a brief breakdown of some distinct and popular genres and some bands that are sometimes associated with them:


Grindcore: Napalm Death, Mertzbow, and Terrorizer.
Powerviolence: Man Is The Bastard, Spazz, and Charles Bronson.

, Take a modern rock band you like and listen to their hardcore influences (most rock bands today were influenced by hardcore). Like My Chemical Romance? Listen to The Misfits, the Cramps, and Gun Club. Do you like Screeching Weasel? Listen to the Descendants. Do you like Rise Against? Listen to Black Flag. Look up the hardcore bands that influenced your favorite musicians today.

, Like members of any subculture, hardcore punk rockers value authenticity and it's true that many like to question whether or not fans and bands are ""real"" hardcore or ""real"" punk rockers. It's a silly argument, but it's something you'll likely confront. To be prepared, it's important that you do some homework and know the ropes.


Read the book or watch the movie American Hardcore, which details the history of the genre in quick fashion. Both are a very good look into what hardcore was all about, and you can probably find the movie online for free., Good hardcore songs are like swift roundhouse punches to the jaw: they smack you, knock you back, and are gone before you’re sure what happened. The average hardcore song lasts about 90 seconds, featuring howling vocals, super-fast chugging rhythm sections, and feedback-driven guitar, starting with four clicks of the drumsticks and stopping on a dime.


In the early days of hardcore, Black Flag was known for its militaristic practice routines, going over each song repeatedly for hours at a time until the band was so tight it was almost spooky. Listen to OFF! and Converge to appreciate how tight a great modern hardcore band can be.

, Because the songs go by so fast, it can be easy to miss the political and social commentary that's also an essential part of appreciating hardcore music. The lyrics to hardcore songs are often simple, anthem-style, and often socially conscious. Make sure you get a lyric sheet and follow along once or twice to make sure that you're hearing the messages of the music.


The politics of a given hardcore band will differ widely from band to band. While some bands discuss anarchic rebellion, others are more concerned with social justice and personal empowerment. It may seem like most bands are left wing, but there are plenty of right wing bands like Agnostic Front, especially in New York.
Learn about the background of the musicians to help you interpret the lyrics. While the Circle Jerks track ""Wasted"" might sound like a simple, even dumb, tribute to hedonism, learning about Keith Morris' substance issues, sobriety, and socio-economic perspective deepens the message considerably, revealing layers of sarcasm.

, Hardcore punk is a dynamic and intense style of music and it’d be a shame to listen to it sitting down while you’re studying. Listen to hardcore while you drive, or while you walk around. Get moving. Stand up and thrash around your room while you listen to it. Hardcore music is air-guitar and air-drum approved.

, While it’s common to listen to most music on our phones and iPods these days, hardcore music isn’t the best thing to jam straight into your ear, especially loudly. Instead, play hardcore music on a decent stereo and let the sound fill the room. Hardcore punk rock takes up a lot of space, and the various layers of the sound should come together into a big rhythmic beast.


Earbuds are good for picking out the little details, especially ones with a flat sound signature, but playing something on a stereo lets you get the full scope. Try it both ways.
If you want the soundstage and natural sound of a stereo system without annoying your family or breaking the bank, open-backed headphones such as Sennheiser's HD line sound great.

, Hardcore punk isn’t about destroying property, looking cool, slamming into people at a show, or putting other people down for being ""real"" or ""true."" It’s a politically-conscious and inclusive style of music that’s sprouted DIY scenes in all corners of the world, some of which ended up engaging in some of the above-described behavior. But there are hardcore kids from Dakar to Tallahassee, and what it means to be hardcore in one place might be very different than what it means to be hardcore elsewhere.


Don't focus so much on what's ""authentic"" or the specifics of various sub-genres. Just listen to the music, appreciate the records, and go see the bands. Have fun.

, Perhaps more than any other music, it's hard to get the full experience of a hardcore act on record. Lots of the classics are still touring, though featuring slightly different line-ups, and lots of contemporary hardcore bands are touring, trying to make a buck, and selling their merch on the road. If you find a band you like, get on their mailing list, check them out when they come through town, and support the artists.


Check your local venues for hardcore bands you might not have listened to yet. There are more DIY hardcore bands out there than you'd think, and they tend to tour more than big-name hardcore and post-hardcore bands.
Buying records is expensive and most bands that make it these days make it by touring, primarily. If you want to buy a record, get a ticket and buy the record from the merch table instead of buying it off iTunes. You'll get it straight from the artist and that money will go toward paying to get to the next town., There is a vibrant subculture within hardcore punk called straight edge, which takes its name from the Minor Threat track ""Straight Edge."" The song is Ian McKaye's tribute to clean-living, and people who consider themselves ""straight edge"" or ""edge"" swear off alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. Others swear off casual sex, and there is even a faction of vegetarian/vegan straight edge.


Straight edgers are sometimes known to have black Xs on the back of their hands to symbolize their abstinence to alcohol drugs and tobacco and casual sex. Sewn-on band patches, safety pins, and jean vests are also sometimes common hardcore attire.

, Hardcore punk is anti-fashion and doesn’t require any signifiers to be a part of the scene. Most so-called “hardcore kids” wear nothing more than a T-shirt with their favorite band’s logo on it and a pair of jeans. No flashy accessories, no weird hairstyles, just normal-looking stuff.


Make your own clothes. Don't want to pay $18 at Hot Topic for a Black Flag shirt? Henry Rollins would be the first person to tell you not to. Buy a plain white shirt for a fraction of the price and put the Black Flag logo on it yourself. That’s hardcore.

, You can love hardcore punk and love pop country music. You can love hardcore punk rock and listen to Elvis. You can love hardcore punk rock and go to Lady Gaga shows with the other Lil Monsters. There's nowhere that it says ""real"" hardcore punk rockers can't listen to other kinds of music. Hardcore is about being yourself and empowering yourself, not pretending to be something you aren't and denying yourself other types of music that you legitimately like.

The simple way to develop your rhythm is with simple clapping exercises.,
Get someone, be it a friend, a family member, or a music teacher/tutor, to clap a simple tune/rhythm.,
Get someone to play a rhythmic melody (piano or any other instrument will do) and see if you can copy the rhythm played by clapping it out.,
For homework: When listening to your favourite music, try nodding to the beat, then clapping or clicking your fingers to time.",How to Learn to Keep Time When Reading Music and Playing a Musical Instrument," A metronome will often help keep rhythm as you go, if you are having trouble keeping a steady beat.


If you don't wish to clap, tapping your foot, or tapping your lap with your hand works just as good. The lap is great because you can practice keeping beat with one hand while tapping a harmonic rhythm with the other.





;
, Your aim is simply to copy the clapping. The more accurate you are, the more you'll be able to copy rhythms you hear.


Make sure they make their clapping progressively more advanced so you know at what stage you can still copy what you hear.

The advanced stuff should only be used once you have mastered the initial exercises.



, Then respond but this time with playing your instrument instead.

, Record yourself doing this then play it back. What were the results? If you're not sure, get someone with 'better ears' to comment and help out.


Do this regularly until you've developed an understanding of coming on time.

Study not only his autograph manuscripts and related material (i.e.,
Consider that Chopin had very definite views on adherence to his score details: ""Chopin could not bear anyone to interfere with the text of his works.,
It is vital from an artistic and aesthetic standpoint that interpreters remain within the ‘guidelines’ marked on scores by the composer.",How to Interpret the Music of Fryderyk Chopin," draft scores, early editions and annotated scores), but also statements made by his associates, friends and pupils, who knew his playing and teaching principles. In addition to general correspondence, reviews and reports of his concerts are revealing, (although not always laudatory!) notably from supporters of the ‘piano pounders’, as Chopin called them. Include Polish folk-music and the historical development of the Polonaise, Rondo, Krakowiak, Mazur and Mazurka.


Here is an example of the wide disparities that exist between Chopin’s expressed intentions and the interpretative approach commonly adopted when executing his famous ‘Black Keys’ Study in G flat major, Op.10 No.5. Performances of this remarkable Study are generally executed in brilliant style: Allegro con brio/Presto with highly-charged forte dynamics, heavily accented and liberally pedalled to suit the desired virtuosic display. This approach is, however, in direct opposition to Chopin’s original score markings and his concept of its interpretation. His score markings clearly show leggierissimo e legatissimo (extremely light and delicate with a very smooth effect), carefully balanced against the staccato l.h. accompaniment. The first forte marking appears at bar 33, lasting two bars. Exaggerated dynamics and excessively fast tempo markings imposed on this Study are not to be found in the autograph manuscript.** Chopin’s performance directions are certainly easier to ignore than achieve. There is also the problem of maintaining too fast a tempo from the outset to include the closing double-octaves that descend in a flourish of triplets. No slowing down of pace is indicated, not even a poco rit.!
The celebrated E major étude, Op.10 No.3, also shows the disparities that exist when comparing Chopin’s autograph manuscripts with various edited publications. It was originally given the tempo Vivace by Chopin, who later added ma non troppo. ** A labouring or variable pulse that disregards the 2/4 time signature (notated in quavers and semiquavers) is incorrect, even if widely accepted. It is not in 4/4 time and the passages (from bar 46) have no fortissimo or doppio movimento indications. The poco piú animato (often marked at bar 21) is not given in the original ms. Chopin’s ardent dislike of the sentimentalisé approach and exaggerated tempo deviations are well known. Additional tempo changes also break down the musical logic and structure of the whole, subverting Chopin’s expressed intentions.;
, The slightest modification was a gross error for which he would not pardon even his closest friends, not even his fervent admirer Liszt. The composer considered these alterations as a veritable act of sacrilege"". (Reported by Marmontel) . Where Chopin’s score markings are correctly stated in publications his compositions still fall prey to alterations in performance, perpetuated by generations of pianistic ‘tradition’ and stylisation. Unfortunately the various ‘revisions’ imposed on Chopin’s scores from pianists seeking to remould or ‘re-compose’ his music remain unchallenged.


He would occasionally pencil an altered dynamic or variant into the scores of selected pupils but it was only his prerogative as the composer-pianist to make any such alterations. On the subject of the sentimentalisé/Romantic approach, we know that he shunned all forms of excess and was not a Romantic composer in the Lisztian sense. His unique musical language and aesthetic belongs to earlier forms of art-music and Classicism. He revered the music of Bach and Mozart above all other composers - the significance of which should not be underestimated. To perceive Chopin as the archetypal Romantic languishing in a violet-scented mist of indecision about his scores is a misconception borne of spurious legend.

, To clarify these ‘guidelines’, albeit simplistically, refer to score indications that form the basis of an interpretation: e.g. that given sotto voce/pianissimo markings are not substituted for a preferred mezzo forte/forte, or broad largo/lento tempos exchanged for the faster pace of an Allegretto.


Uncontrolled tempo deviations, which appear under the guise of unwritten accelerandos alternating with ritenutos, are a poor substitute for the subtle use of rubato. It is evident from his manuscripts at least that Chopin left nothing to doubt, crossing out rejected score details with thick webs of diagonal lines that render it impossible to decipher previously written details. To further avoid misunderstanding he would write a message on his score for the engraver to clarify his precise intentions.
Wayward performances showing an obvious ambivalence towards the text are often acclaimed, perhaps due to obvious misunderstandings about Chopin’s music, or for commercial reasons. Displays of meaningless digital dexterity and the flashiness of excessively fast tempos and dramatized dynamics that debase his music are facile recipes for acceptable Chopin interpretations. They are not only seriously misleading to the public but commit a grave disservice to the composer. The true art of Chopin playing presents a challenge that needs to be reviewed and reassessed.
""Simplicity is everything.. After having played immense quantities of notes, and more notes, then simplicity emerges with all its charm, like Art’s final seal. It is no easy matter."" "

Listen to the song often.,
Write the lyrics down.,
Sing the lyrics right before getting a full night’s rest.",How to Learn Lyrics1," Play the song anywhere and everywhere, including in the car while you’re on your way to school or work, on your phone in your bedroom while you’re getting ready each day, and wherever else you can.It’s easier to listen often if you keep digital copies of the song on multiple platforms, including your phone, your laptop, a CD, a MP3 player, and a thumb drive.Listening is great for learning the lyrics, whether or not the words are in your native language.;
, Look up the lyrics online and then print them out. Copy all of the lyrics by writing them down on a sheet of paper while using the printed lyrics as a reference. Copy the lyrics over and over again. You can do this in a quiet place while fully concentrated or while doing a laid back activity such as watching TV.If you’d rather type the lyrics out, you can do that as an alternative. It’ll have the same effect as writing.
You can also test yourself by writing down all of the song lyrics without having the printed lyrics nearby.

, In order to memorize anything effectively, you need to be well-rested. Study after study has linked lack of sleep to forgetfulness as well as hindered learning and thinking. Focus on the lyrics throughout the day and sing the song through a few times before going to bed so that it’s fresh in your mind.Sleep for either 7-9 hours if you're an adult or 8-10 hours if you’re a child or teen to ensure a properly functioning memory."

Have control of the music around your friends for a little while.,
Play a mixture of the songs that they normally listen to and a small amount of the genre that you are trying to introduce them to.

,
Make sure you play songs that they more than likely haven't heard before or ones that they didn't know were from that genre.

,
Do this when you have the opportunity, but make sure not to push your luck by playing too much of a genre they say they do not like.

,
Once you hear them beginning to acknowledge specific songs you have picked out, let them know who the artist is and casually mention what type of music they play.

,
If a friend, which is very rare, asks what genre you are playing,tell him/her straight in the eye and try to give good comments on that specific genre but do not exaggerate on how cool and awesome the genre is.,
Have patience if your friends have a hard time accepting or liking your genres.,
Have fun while listening to your own music genre.",How to Introduce a Friend to a Specific Genre of Music,";
,,,,, Otherwise they might think you are just trying to prove or endorse your likes in that genre to them and they might suddenly lose interest on it.

, There will come a time that they'll realize that the ones you are tuning in are worth listening.

, Music, like Art, is self expression. If they tease you with your choice of music, explain to them that this is your ""stuff"" and that they should respect that. Who knows? If they see you having fun with your choice of music then they might give it a try.

Sing along to the instrumental version.,
Memorize one line at a time.,
Read and then say the lyrics out loud by section.,
Run through the song in your head.",How to Learn Lyrics2," Get a copy of both the original, complete song as well as the instrumental version. Sing along to the original song and then immediately afterward, sing along to the instrumental version. This will be much more challenging because you’ll have no help from the singer on the original track. You’ll be on your own if you forget details such as how to start the next verse or how the song ends., Study just the first line of the song and then sing it out loud without the lyrics in front of you. Then study the second line and sing both line 1 and 2 without the lyrics in front of you. Continue memorizing this way until you can sing the entire song without looking.If the song isn’t in your native language, make sure that you’re getting the pronunciation right as you memorize so that you don’t memorize the words incorrectly.

, Print out the song’s lyrics and then read a section out loud. Then flip the page over and try to recite the entire section again. Do this for all sections of the song over and over until you can recite nearly all of them. You should eventually be able to speak the entire song out loud with the sheet of paper turned over.You can also read through the lyrics earlier on in the memorization process to help familiarize yourself with them.

, Without any music to listen to or printed lyrics to read, try to sing the entire song in your head. If you get stuck, quickly glance at the printed lyrics and find the spot that you’re stuck at. Then flip the lyrics back over and continue running through the song in your head. Repeat this process until you can get through the entire song without looking at the printed lyrics."

Visualize the lyrics as you read through them.,
Try to find out what the lyrics mean.,
Try to relate to the song emotionally.,
Translate the song if it’s in a foreign language.",How to Learn Lyrics3," As you read through or listen to the song, imagine yourself in different scenes doing everything the lyrics are saying. This will help you to remember the lyrics because you can visualize what’s happening in the song and what will happen next.

For example, if one of the lines in the song is, “let’s go party, it’s Saturday night,” you might picture yourself in your bedroom on the weekend with some fun music on, picking out a snazzy outfit, getting ready to go out., Just like with any artistic form, meaning isn’t always obvious. While you’re reading or listening to the lyrics, really focus on what the writer is trying to communicate and what exactly is going on in the story that’s being told. Memorization is a lot easier when you’re learning something with meaning that is a part of a whole rather than just a bunch of empty, random words.


If you can’t figure it out, you can always look up the song’s meaning online.For example, in “The Scientist” by Coldplay, there’s a section that reads: “Questions of science / Science and progress / Do not speak as loud as my heart. / Tell me you love me / Come back and haunt me / Oh, and I rush to the start.” While studying just these lines, you could come to the conclusion that in this song, the narrator may have made a mistake in a romantic relationship, can’t focus on their work because of it, and wants to go back and handle the situation differently., Similar to other art forms, songs usually express some emotion. As you listen to the song or read over the lyrics, try to pick out the emotions that are being expressed and connect with them by letting yourself experience those emotions while singing the words.If singing a song about breaking up, for example, you might hone in on the loneliness and sorrow you would feel if the song was about you.
If singing a song about standing your ground when someone is hurtful, you might imagine yourself in a powerful, determined state.

, It’s even harder to know what you’re singing about and learn song lyrics when the song isn’t sung in your native language. Look up a translation of the song online and read through it in your own language so that you can better understand what it’s about.

You can even copy down the translated version if that helps you remember what each part of the song is saying.Try using a music translation app such as Musixmatch Lyrics Finder."

Find the piece you are working on.,
Split the piece up.,
Practice each hand individually.,
If it is a popular piece or song that you know, try to play along to the lyrics/music in your head when practicing your right hand.,
Add to the piece bit by bit.,
Slow it down.,
Take your time.,
Identify any problem sections and break them down further.,
Play it through once you think you've got the hang of it.,
Don't leave it wrong.",How to Learn a Piano Piece Quickly," Listen to the dynamics; this helps with mostly classical pieces.
, Setting yourself smaller goals within the piece of music will make it more manageable and less frustrating. Moreover, by splitting it into parts, you can listen to the dynamics with greater ease and try to follow along as you listen. This helps you to tell the difference between how you're playing and how the artist is playing the piece.


The extent of parts you split the piece up into will depend on the length of the music and how difficult it is; use your judgement to decide.

, Learn the right hand part first, then the left. Don't try to play them together until you can play them both individually, fluently.

, That way you'll know when you go wrong and you'll be able to memorize it easier.

, Rather than trying to play all the way through, play one line a few times, then add the next line, then the next.

, Don't try to play it at full speed until you can play it slowly without making mistakes.

, You'll end up feeling frustrated if you try to do it all at once. Take regular breaks and play other pieces which you can play while you're learning a difficult piece.

, If you need to spend 10 minutes on getting 2 chords right, then spend 10 minutes on it. It will be worth it in the long run and ignoring a problem part can cause frustration later on when it is the only part you cannot play.

, This will allow you to identify any places you are still going wrong. Remember to keep coming back to the piece now you can play it, so you don't forget it.

, If you stop practicing after playing it wrongly, you will remember it incorrectly. By making sure you end on a section you can play, the correct version will stick in your mind, making it easier to play next time.

Listen to the song 3-4 times in silence.,
Learn the song's rhythm.,
Some genres and bands will ""play"" with rhythm-- changing it mid-song or ""hiding"" it in other rhythms.,
Find the song's key if you play a melody instrument.,
Lean how to read music.,
Learn the song by ear if you cannot buy or find sheet music.",How to Learn a Song1," Don't try to sing or practice along just yet-- you'll be practicing the wrong words and melodies until you know the song well. Listen for the lyrics, the melody, and how the singer reacts to the band or backing track.;
, Most music has a consistent pattern of ""beats"" that keeps the entire band playing at the same time. The easiest way to learn the rhythm of a song is to tap your feet along with the song. Each ""tap"" is a beat. In modern songs, listening to the kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) is the easiest way find rhythm if you are unsure.

, This is usually found in jazz or metal, or old song's without consistent beats.


Time signatures, like 4/4 or 3/2, are used to write out rhythm. The first number tells you how many beats are in a measure, and the second tells you the length of each beat. 4/4 is the most common, and it means that the song repeats 4 beats of 4 quarter notes (1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, etc).

, Any instrument that plays notes and chords is a melody instrument. Often, finding the root note is usually as easy as finding the first note played. The song's key most important part of it's melodic structure, and is the first thing you need to know to figure out a song.


To find a song's key, look for the one note that you can play over every section of the song without sounding bad or ""out of key.""
It can help to hum to a song. Our brains are wired to understand melody, and often the first note you will try to hum is the song's key. Find the note on your instrument that matches your humming and you have the key!, Sheet music is a blueprint for playing a song. If you play an orchestral instrument or a piano, reading music is essential to learning new songs, but all instruments can benefit from written music. Spend some time every day practicing reading music and look up notes or symbols your don't know.


Reading music can also help teach music theory, which will help you decipher songs that you can't find music for.
Guitars, bass guitars, and drums are often written in ""tablature,"" a simplified way of reading music that tells you where to place your hands or drumsticks instead of what notes to play.

, This can be difficult for some songs, but start by finding out what key the song is in and what tempo it is at. Then experiment from there with relevant scales, chords, and rhythms until you feel confident that you know the song.Write down the part as you figure it out so you don't forget anything.
Work slowly, writing out 2-3 bars of the song at a time before moving on.
Bring songs you are struggling to learn to a teacher or experienced player and see if they know the part or can help learn it.

Start practicing at a slower tempo, then build up speed.,
Play your instrument along with the original song.,
Improvise new lines over what you've learned.",How to Learn a Song2," Instrumentalists of all skill levels need to warm up to play their best. Warming up and performing exercises regularly will improve your speed, technique, and knowledge of your instrument.


Tune your instrument every time you play so that you learn the correct notes for the song.
Try new scales and rhythms in different keys and tempos to prepare for new songs.
Take care of your instrument with new strings, reeds, drum heads, etc. so that you get the sound you want.

, You should be familiar with the entire song, but you need to know your instrument's part like the back of your hand. Search the internet for a copy of the song without any vocals, if applicable.


Playing with your music player's equalizer can help isolate your instrument. Pump up the bass, or turn up the treble to hear the drums.

, The snare drum is often easiest to hear, so learn the whole snare drum rhythm first. Then add the ride cymbal rhythm, then move on to the kick drum, etc.


Get the basic rhythm down before trying any wild solos or drum fills.

, Most songs are composed of several bars of music that are repeated many times. Once you know a few ""building blocks"" of the song you can learn these separately and combine them later.


Most parts are either 1,2,4, or 8 bars longs.
Different parts of songs (verses, choruses, bridges, solos) often have slightly different parts that repeat. Learn each part individually.

, To make sure that you can play the song cleanly and without mistakes, start practicing the song around half the tempo you eventually want to play it. As you get comfortable, speed up your play while practicing.A metronome is an invaluable way to practice your rhythm and work your way up to the right tempo.

, This let's you hear if you played each part correctly or missed notes. If you can gather some musicians together, play the song with a full band, where can play your instrument without any guidance or support.

, Improvisation is the act of spontaneously composing new parts over an established song, and is the best way to know if you can play a song. By taking inspiration from the song and adding your own spin, you deepen your connection to the song and make it your own. Remember-- you need to stay in the same key and keep the same rhythm.


Scales are collections of notes that sound good together and are the basis for melody solos and improvisation. Play around with a scale in the correct key to start improvising. The most common scales in modern music are the major scale and the minor pentatonic.
If you keep the same number of beats you can change the speed by doubling or tripping your percussion hits. For example, if a song is in 4/4 (4 beats to a measure), you can play ""double time"" by playing twice as many notes in the same rhythm, making 8/4.
Play around to the original song. If you have a recording of the song, play it in the background while you try to invent new parts over the top of it.

Memorize the lyrics using a book or online source.,
Practice good singing habits.,
Break down the song into smaller parts.,
Practice as often as you can.,
Find your connection to the lyrics.",How to Learn a Song3," Look up the words to the song if you have any confusion about what you're hearing. Keep singing along with the lyrics in front of you until you feel like you have them memorized, likely five or six times depending on the song.


As you get comfortable, close your eyes and sing sections to see if you have them down.

, While everyone is born with a set vocal ""range,"" taking care of your voice and practicing vocal exercises can make the difference between nailing a song and struggling. And, though everyone has a set range, you need to practice in order to reach that range. to hit every note.


Always warm up your voice before singing.Try not to scream or yell during the day, as it strains your vocal chords.
Have a reference note on hand if you are having trouble staying in tune.

, Practice each verse on it's own, perfecting one before moving on to the next. Mastering the hard parts instead of trying to sing the entire song every time will highlight and eliminate mistakes faster.

, Keep singing the song until you feel comfortable, and don't be afraid to ""make it your own"" with little changes and personality. try to find an instrumental version of the song so that you can focus solely on your own vocals.


If you can, record yourself singing and listen in to find any mistakes.
Play a melody instrument, like a guitar or piano, so you can sing without the backing track to guide you.

, To make a song truly good you need to dive into why the song is important to you. Why did you choose to learn this song, and how do the lyrics affect you? By tapping into these feelings you'll start singing the song with a passion and uniqueness that will make the song shine.


Don't over think this -- just keep practicing until you concentrate less on the notes and more on the feelings behind them.

Listen to the song all the way through.,
Look up the lyrics.,
Play the song on an instrument.,
Visualize the song changing.,
Picture the song ending.",How to Get a Song Out of Your Head1," Most stuck songs, or ""earworms,"" are actually parts of a song, such as a catchy chorus or even just a line or two. Your brain might be replaying this because it's ""stuck"" on where to go next. Listen to the complete song from beginning to end. This may be the most effective solution, although there are still plenty of times it doesn't work.Engaging with the song doesn't work for everyone. If you hate the idea of listening to the song again, read the section above on distraction techniques.;
, Unclear or forgotten lyrics can also ""frustrate"" your brain. Look the lyrics up online. Sing them aloud or ""sing"" silently to yourself to help your brain process the song.


If you can memorize all the lyrics, this might make the song too long to hold in your head.

, If you can play an instrument, try to recreate the song. Grappling with the music and working out how to play it solves the problem for many musicians.


Try out different tweaks and variations to break the repetitive cycle.

, Even if you find this difficult, a sense of control can make you less anxious about the situation. For a few minutes, or until you start feeling frustrated, try to change the song in the following ways:


Imagine turn down the volume knob of the song, until it ""sounds"" like a whisper.
Imagine your mind as a room with many rooms. Build barriers in front of the song, slowly caging it into a smaller and smaller area. Each time you add a barrier, the song becomes quieter and more muffled.
'Play' the song in your head at a different tempo, imagining it as (very) slow or fast.

, Once the song is quiet, it's time to end it. Use more visualization techniques to kick it out of your head once and for all:


Visualize a sword or sharp object within your head, severing the link between your mind and the song.
Imagine a record player in as much detail as possible. Look closely at the needle moving through the groove as the song plays. Lift the needle and listen to the sudden silence.When you get to the end of the song, sing the last note (aloud or in your head), then let the pitch drop steadily until it's much lower than any note in the song. This can sometimes prevent it starting again.

, One study showed that fighting the song often leads to more frequent, longer episodes later.Try to ignore the tune while you think about something else on your mind. This isn't always possible, but spend a few minutes trying.

, Anagrams, crossword puzzles, and other word-based puzzles can help drive away the song.Thinking about words occupies the same area of your brain that plays the imagined lyrics. Stay focused, and your brain might only be able to stick to one of the two tasks.


If you notice no difference and feel yourself getting frustrated, stop. Occasionally, an earworm can get worse if you try to fight it., A relaxing activity may work best if you feel anxious about the earworm, or are worried you can't control it. Here are a few options that occupy the listening and speech centers of your brain:Recite something or read aloud.
Hold a conversation.

Meditate.

Pray.
Read a book.
Watch television.
Play a video game that includes speech and/or text.

, Always choose a song that you enjoy, just in case it replaces the one in your head! Ideally, you'll find a ""cure tune"" that drives out the old song but doesn't get stuck in your head itself. Most ""cure tunes"" are specific to one person, but there are a few that turned out to be more popular in one survey:If you hate the idea of listening to these songs, read on for advice on finding your own.

God Save the Queen

, Start with a song that's less likely to get in your head. Avoid ""catchy"" tunes, and ideally look for something you've only listened to once or twice before. The harder it is to sing along to, the less likely it is to stick.

, If that doesn't work, it's time to bring out the big guns. This cure will often get stuck in your head instead, but hopefully if that happens it will be more pleasant. Here are some types of ""sticky"" songs:


Songs you know well, especially ones associated with nostalgia or a specific memory.Songs that are easy to sing along to. These tend to have notes with long durations, and small changes in pitch.Most pop songs fit this description.
Songs with repetition. These include nursery rhymes, songs with repetitive choruses, and, again, most pop songs.

, You can sometimes break the song's hold with math problems that take all your attention to solve.Try to calculate 8208 ÷ 17, or solve 2 x 2 x 2 x 2... as long as you can.


A problem that's too difficult will fail to engage you. Pick something within your range of ability."

Write about yourself.,
Write about your emotions.,
Keep a journal.,
Write down your dreams.,
Leave the house.,
Try something new.,
Be nostalgic.",How to Find Inspiration to Write Songs1," Your life experience (memories, opinions, emotions) is your richest resource and your perspective is what will ultimately make your song unique. Keeping a list of things that happen to you or emotions that go through you will give you a wealth of material to draw on.For example, keep note of stories that you either hear or personally experience.Stories are always a great source of material for songs not only because they are unique but because they tend to have a range of different emotions, which will likely make your song more interesting.;
, Think about an emotionally charged event in your life, such as a death, wedding, birth, falling in love, etc. Do your best to describe what you felt at that time and try to be as detailed as possible.


For example, if writing about a breakup, write out a list of words that come to mind that describe the scene (not only how you felt, but the surroundings, what colors stood out to you, any adjectives that come to mind, etc). Don’t worry at this stage about rhyming or setting the lyrics to a specific melody. For now, just having this raw material down is a great start.

, Many of us go through our days and only write down notes, lists, emails and the like but keeping a journal will allow you to reflect on what you are going through and provide you with material from which you can mine different images and phrases for your songs.

, Many of us have strange, abstract dreams that we quickly forget about after waking up. Instead of letting go of those interesting images and unusual situations, keep a dream journal! Not only will writing down your dreams help you remember them for longer, but you’ll have a new repository of strange and unique stories and images to use for your songs.


Keep a pen and journal right by your bed and write down your dreams as soon as you wake up. We tend to forget our dreams as we wake up, so writing them down as soon as possible will allow you to get the most out of this practice.

, Go for walks in public places and look at other people or your surroundings for inspiration. Lots of songwriters write about nature, other people, or interesting experiences. Get out there and let the world inspire you.


Try eavesdropping. Sometimes, listening in on someone else’s conversation can open you up to a totally new perspective and you may even find something intriguing or surprisingly lyrical in someone else’s words. Just be sure to write them down so you don’t forget them later while writing your song!
If there’s a place you feel particularly emotionally connected to, such as a specific park, try going there with a pen and paper and just sit down and write whatever comes to mind.

, Many musicians lead very interesting lives that also serve as inspiration for their lyrics.Get out of your comfort zone and try something new. Whatever the outcome, it’ll certainly give you something to write about.


Trying new things also tends to give people an adrenaline rush and this can be an exhilarating, inspiring experience. Though extreme activities, such as skydiving or scuba diving, can be great options, you don’t have to do anything too crazy to get the same rush. Traveling somewhere you’ve never been, going to an unusual event, or even trying out a new recipe or DIY project can all be potential sources of inspiration., Look at old photo albums, reread old letters, visit family and childhood friends and talk about the past. Nostalgia is a very powerful mix of emotions and from these activities can emerge many stories and emotions to draw on."

Get inspired by your life.,
Be inspired by love.,
Write something that raises your confidence or self-esteem.,
Let it come to you.",How to Get Ideas for Songwriting1," You experience your own life, and you get to experience the feelings first-hand. If you're going through some tough times, you can always write a song about it. You'll find that your song will include your emotions in it. When there's emotions in a song, it comes to life. It is a good practice to keep a journal or have a blog to record down your daily experiences. Not only do you practice writing, you reflect on the day and it'll come back to you when you need inspiration.;
, This is one of the most common song-writing themes. Many songs we hear these days revolve around love. It can be either a happy song or a sad song. If you were to talk about your love leaving your side for another person, then it would be a sad love song. Maybe you can write about how magical the feeling is like to fall in love. Remember, include your emotions if you can.

, Write a song about how you are able to conquer the odds. Whenever you feel low, just think about how you are able to come all the way here. Think about positive things that can raise your confidence and boost your mood. Your song will sound very positive and not only will you feel better after that, other people, whom you have shared your song with, might feel good as well.

, Just play the piano or strum a few chords on the guitar. After doing so for awhile, just start singing. There may be some of time where you'll just be singing ""hmm..."" but no worries, the words will eventually come to you. Let inspiration strike you. That's how some songs came about.

Decide if you need a “master use license” instead.,
Identify the song you want to use.,
Understand licenses.,
Gather relevant information for your application.,
Find the publisher.,
Contact the licensing department.,
Negotiate the licensing fee.,
Hire a lawyer, if necessary.,
Get the license in writing.",How to Get Sync Rights," If you want to use a specific recording of a song, then you need what is called a “master use license.”For example, if you want to use Beyonce’s version of “If I Were a Boy,” then you need the master use license in addition to the synchronization license.


You need only a sync license if you will have someone else perform the song. This person could be you, someone you hire to sing the song, or an orchestra to perform the song.;
, You need to find the name of the song that you want to use. If you only know a few lyrics, then try to find the name of the song. You need to contact the publisher to get a sync license.


If you know only a few lines to a song, then see Find a Song You Don’t Know the Name Of for tips on how to identify a song.

, If you are successful at getting sync rights, then they will be transferred to you by a license. A license grants you rights for a limited amount of time. A license can also limit your use of those rights.


For example, a license could grant you the right to use the song in a music video but not in a movie. Or the license could grant you the right to use it in one visual production or to use it in an unlimited number of videos.
A license is like a lease to an apartment. When you get a lease, you do not own the apartment. Instead, you are given the right to use it for a set amount of time. However, the landlord can still place limitations on how you use the apartment. The publisher of a song can likewise put limits on how you use your sync rights.

, You will need to contact the song’s publisher and request sync rights. You will also probably need to provide some basic information about what you want to use the song for. Pull together the following information before reaching out to the publisher:a synopsis of the film, including information about the budget
a detailed description of how you intend to use the song (e.g., in the opening or closing credits)
the number of times you plan to use the song
where a film will be shown (e.g., an independent film festival or online)

, In order to get sync rights you need to contact the publisher who represents the song’s writer or producer. You can find the publisher in a couple of ways:Check the CD case. The publisher for a song should be listed.
Search websites like BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC. These organizations represent publishers and songwriters. You can search these databases by song title, writer, artist, and publisher.

, Once you have a publisher contact, you need to call them and tell them that you would like to license sync rights to a certain song. Tell them the name of the song, the writer, publisher, and length of the music.For example, you might want to use the first minute of a song in your film’s opening credits. You need to accurately state how much of the song you want to use and the purpose because these will impact the fee you are quoted.

, There is no standard fee that you will pay.Instead, the publisher will quote you a number. You can either accept it or try to negotiate the fee lower.


It can be very difficult to negotiate with music publishers. Some might have a “take it or leave it” approach. Realize, however, that you might be able to lower the licensing fee if you use less of the song.

, You might need help getting the synch rights. Sometimes, more than one publisher owns rights to a song, so you need to coordinate with multiple publishers.If you need assistance, then speak with an attorney. You can find an entertainment lawyer by contacting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.


Some law firms provide “pro bono” services for people who work in the creative arts. You should think about looking into this option if you run into resistance from the publisher. Search for artist organizations in your city or county. These organizations sometimes have contacts with lawyers willing to provide pro bono legal services.
You could also hire a music clearance and licensing company.They have experience obtaining sync rights. To find one, search the Internet for “music rights specialist.”

, Do not use the song until you have a valid, signed license. After you receive the contract from the publisher, show it to your attorney before signing.

Listen to music.,
Explore other art forms.,
Pay attention to unconventional art forms.",How to Find Inspiration to Write Songs2," This may seem obvious, but listening to music and paying attention to the song lyrics will not only teach you more about the mechanics of successful song lyrics, but can also be inspiring.


Try taking a walk and listening to music without lyrics. You can also do this while sitting down, but being outside and moving can help inspire you to come up with lyrics that are set to the music you are listening to. Pause every so often to take notes if you come up with any lines you think are particularly good.
Go back and listen to the music that initially inspired you to start songwriting. Everyone has different musical tastes and influences that change over time. Go back to the musicians who first inspired you and spend some time listening to their music and figuring out just what it is about their music that you like so much. Doing so will help you know what to emulate and what to avoid in your own songs.
Pay attention to the classics. Iconic songwriters, from Quincy Jones to Woody Guthrie, attained their status for a reason. Regardless of your particular music tastes, you should spend at least an afternoon listening to some classics and dissecting what about them appeal to so many people. Make note of the arrangements and structures as well as the lyrics as these will inform your own songs later.Listen to various types of music, especially new styles or music that you don’t normally listen to. Broadening your musical horizons will inspire you to incorporate new sounds or styles that you wouldn’t have otherwise considered.

, You don’t have to limit yourself to music for inspiration. Try to consume as much art as possible in all its different forms as doing so can inspire you in unexpected ways. Watch movies, read books, go to art galleries--anything creative can feed your own artistic spirit.


Reading different forms of literature can also help your songwriting a great deal. Poetry is a great place to start because it is most similar to song lyrics. Reading also has the added benefit of expanding your vocabulary, which you can also use in your own songs., Inspiration is all around us as long as we are open to it. From street art to experimental theatre, the more you get out of your comfort zone, the more exciting possible inspirations you may find.


For example, you could spend a day exploring the graffiti in your area with a pad and paper. Many street artists are compelled to make public art for a wide range of reasons (such as raising political awareness or beautifying an urban area).Therefore, there’s often a diverse range of emotions and images that can inspire you. As you explore, be sure to take note of any descriptions, phrases, or emotions that come to mind.
Discomfort isn’t always a bad thing. Seeking out new experiences (such as strange art forms that you aren’t naturally attracted to) may make you uncomfortable but this challenge could actually fuel you to produce new, exciting work.This is especially true for those who may feel like they are stuck in a rut or creating the same thing over and over.

Experiment with different writing exercises.,
Try writing about an object.,
Try a David Bowie-approved exercise.",How to Find Inspiration to Write Songs3," There are many different writing exercises one can use to get inspired. If you’re feeling really stumped and don’t know where to start, try a writing exercise. Having a specific set of instructions can take the pressure off and get those creative juices flowing.


If you feel intimidated, try telling yourself that you’ll only write for five minutes. If, after five minutes, nothing comes out you’ll know that you’ve at least tried. However, more often than not, you’ll find yourself settling into the writing process after five minutes and you’re likely to come out with at least a few ideas you’re happy with.

, This is a songwriting exercise called “Choose an Object” used at the Berklee College of Music and can be very helpful in generating new ideas.


For this exercise, simply choose an object at random (a potato, pencil, mountain, or article of clothing are all valid options) and spend ten minutes or so writing down any memories you associate with it.
Don’t worry about making it sound good or even writing complete sentences. Instead, focus on using as many different senses as possible (such as taste, smell, sound, emotion). You’ll end up with an unusual list of diverse images and emotions but any or all of it may be great raw materials to craft a song out of later., Bowie has described one of his methods for songwriting and you may want to give it a try to see if it works for you. This exercise can be particularly useful for those times when you just have no idea what you want to write about.


Write down a paragraph or two describing different subjects to create a sort of short story. Obviously, this will be a very rough draft. The point is to simply get anything onto paper, even if it doesn’t make complete sense. Then, cut the sentences into sections of four of five different blocks, then mix them up and reconnect them. They may not make sense or they may form a completely new idea altogether.Either way, given Bowie’s successful career, you might as well try one of his methods to see if it works for you too.

Find a quiet space to work in.,
Decide on a writing routine.,
Minimize distractions.,
Collaborate with others.,
Join a writing group.,
Keep a notebook and pen on you at all times.",How to Find Inspiration to Write Songs4," Though we often think of inspiration as something that just strikes us, a certain level of discipline is also necessary to create polished song lyrics. Having a set place to focus and be creative can motivate you to keep up a regular practice of songwriting.


Something as simple as a desk can be a great place to write. You can even put tools, such as pen, paper, a dictionary and also decorate the space with some of your favorite musical inspirations to keep you going.
Studies have shown that the color blue can enhance performance on a creative task.Try repainting your space blue or have blue decorations in your space to keep you going.

, Some people feel most inspired and excited to write first thing in the morning while other people find the evening time to be best for their creativity. Figure out what time of the day works for you (bearing in mind other responsibilities, such as your job and schoolwork) and decide on a writing routine accordingly.You can even schedule this time into a calendar or planner if you use one. After a few weeks of consciously doing this, it’ll eventually become second nature and you’ll have a steady flow of written material for your songs.

, It’s all too easy to get distracted by social media, chores, and all the other daily aspects of life that demand our attention. However, having a specific time and place to do your writing will carve out some space that takes you away from all of that.


If you use your computer to write, make a commitment to not use the Internet until you get a set amount of work done. If you find yourself constantly itching to look things up, turn off the wifi and write notes in your work of what to research once you are done with the rough draft., Think about who in your life is also engaged in artistic pursuits and ask them if they would be willing to collaborate with you. Collaborating can be as easy as giving each other feedback on each other’s work or even starting a new project together. Not only will you motivate each other to produce work, but you’ll also get great feedback and a fresh outlook that will make you a better songwriter.Your collaborators don’t necessarily have to be musicians. In fact, working with an actor or writer may be even better as you’ll get a totally different perspective.
Be proactive about receiving constructive criticism. After all, you want new, good ideas and so don’t take criticism personally but instead see them as an opportunity to improve.

, If you’re having trouble being disciplined about your writing, consider joining a writing group! Writing groups are generally open to all different forms of writing and knowing that you have an audience that is going to read your work and give you feedback can motivate you to just sit down and get that song onto paper.


Oftentimes you can find local writing groups that meet once a month or so to do writing workshops. Look for ads in cafes or other community spaces. You can also browse websites like Craigslist.
If you feel uncomfortable talking about your work in person, you can also find online writing groups.

, You never know when inspiration will strike so you’ll always want to be able to have these important tools handy.Writing notes down on your phone is a good alternative if you aren’t the type to carry a bag around.

Tell a story.,
Think of metaphors.,
Listen to music.",How to Get Ideas for Songwriting2," If you have recently read a nice book or watched an interesting movie, you can always write a song about the story in it. Allow your song to tell the story. Bring in the melody to raise or lower the tension in the song. Perhaps, you may want to point out the climax and put it where you wish the suspense to be in your song (for example, the bridge). Every listener looks forward to listening to a story.

, One of the more sensitive topics that you may want to write about include life and death. However, life and death definitely have a lot of metaphors that can be used. If you use a dying tree to represent death and a seedling to represent life, then you can always write about the death of a certain person or the birth of a child with metaphors instead. Metaphors will make your song more interesting.

, Perhaps, while you are listening to songs by other artistes, you may find the inspiration to write about certain issues (e.g. racism, happiness, love). Allow the music to spark off something in you. However, you might end up 'blending' a bit of the songs you heard into your own songs, so try not to write songs while listening to songs by other artistes. You don't want to get into trouble with the law.

Use Shazam or MusicID.,

If you've got Shazam on your phone and hear a song you can't identify and don't know anything about, activate the app and hold it toward the audio source and wait for a result.


Shazam can be used on iPhone, Blackberry, Android and most other mobile devices. It can also be used on iPads and iPod touches. MusicID costs a few dollars to put on your iPhone and can also be used on other devices.
These apps typically don't work as well with live performances. If you're watching a band doing a cover, but you can't quite place it, you'll probably need to use another method to identify the song.;
, Even if you can only record a brief clip of the song you like and want to identify, you can upload it to AudioTag to identify the song from its own database when you're back at your computer.


At the very least, you've got a recording of the song that you can use to play for friends or music aficionados and see if they recognize the tune.

, On your phone, you can hum the melody into SoundHound, which is available for free. The app will analyze the melody you sing and give you a list of possible options. On your computer, Midomi serves the same function.


Both of these apps are typically a lot more effective and contemporary songs. Trying to remember the name of the song your grandfather used to sing while he worked tends to be more difficult on these apps, and may require other methods.
NameMyTune and WatZatSong are also crowd-sourced options that work basically the same way. On these websites, you can upload your clip (or yourself trying to sing and describe the song) and other people will get back to you with options.

, If you've got an ear for the melody and an elementary knowledge of the keyboard, you can enter the melody into Musipedia or MelodyCatcher to search for the melody.These sites tend to work better for classical wordless music and other types of non-pop music, because they have a slightly different sort of database of material to analyze.

, This free app analyzes the melody and presents you with a list of possible options. Midomi is another program that works in a similar way. Even if you're not a great singer, the program can recognize the intervals that you're singing. Hum along as much of the melody as you can remember.


NameMyTune and WatZatSong present your singing sample to people online, making it somewhat more reliable than a computer. People usually get back to you pretty quick with a list of options.

, If you don't have any of these options available to you, try to record as much of the song as you can on your phone. It doesn't have to be a great-quality sound file, just good enough for someone to recognize it. When you're back at your computer, you can upload it to AudioTag.

Search the artist by describing them.,
Listen for the radio DJ.",How to Find a Song You Know Nothing About2," Type any lyrics you remember into Google, making sure to add quotation marks around the lyrics. This limits the search to those words in that order, so even if all you can remember is ""she said you would be mine,"" it'll be easier to find if you group them in quotes.

, If you're looking for a song you heard during the credits of a TV show, do a quick search for ""Song playing at the end of Sopranos Episode Six, Season Five"" or ""Song in Mazda commercial.""


If you think you're getting close, use iTunes. If you heard the song on a TV show or movie, try searching for the soundtrack on iTunes. If you find it, play free samples of each song on the album by hovering your mouse over the track number and pressing the blue play button that appears.
You can also try searching on YouTube when you've narrowed your search down some.

, Describe whether its sung by a male, female or group, and any other kinds of descriptions of the song you might remember. Ask yourself if the song sounds familiar. Is the voice distinct? Could it be somebody you already listen to or like? If you think it sounds a lot like a singer or group you have heard, check that band's website or their fan sites to see if they have any new releases and listen to them

, If you're hearing the song on the radio, try to stick around for a moment and listen. The DJ may go over the songs he or she just played. Call the station or visit the station's website to see if they post a playlist of the songs played that day.

What's the song about? try to remember any words from the song at all. try to remember the content of the song.

, Open Google and type any lyrics that you remember in quotation marks. Then type the word ""lyrics"" and any other context that you can remember. See what comes up, then search for the song in YouTube or iTunes or some other database of your choice. The chorus is best, but any lyrics are helpful.


Cowboy Lyrics is the best country music lyric database on the internet, but Google will usually take you there. It tends to skew more toward classic country, rather than contemporary pop country, though, so it might be hard to find what you're looking for.

, If the song was less memorable than the video that you saw, try to describe it. What happens in the video? What's the plot? Describe the video in as much detail as possible in your search.


Keep it short and to-the-point: ""country music video car wreck on a dirt road""

, If you're fairly certain the song was new when you heard it, check out what new singles were released in the last couple weeks, and what country songs are climbing the charts. Make a playlist of the songs and listen to them to see if your song is in there. If not, you might find one you like even more.

, If you hear the song being played, write down some of the lyrics so that you can search them on the Internet later. Some radio stations announce the title of the song and the artist after the song is over, but others may not. Either way, you can hear the song again and learn more about tit.


Write down the name of the station and the time that you heard the song. Lots of radio stations put playlists online, if they don't call them out on air. You could also call the DJs of the radio stations and try to describe the song.

Make sure that your chest is high to give room for your lungs to expand and contract. This allows you to breathe easily and reach maximum lung capacity, which results in better notes and phrases.If you're sitting, the same things apply. Move to the front half of the seat, and keep both of your feet flat on the floor. Don't cross your legs. Keeping your body in line allows for more control and sustained singing without strain. If you are sitting, your back should not touch the back of seat. It should be straight.;
, Although there are proper techniques, the exact position that you sing in can vary from person to person. Of course you won’t sing at your best from a slouched position, but singing with an extremely straight back may feel uncomfortable for you. Try singing in different positions until you find the one that is best for you., The voice is best described as a wind instrument because breathing is 80% of singing. Proper singing begins and ends with proper breathing. Begin working on breathing properly by working on deep breaths that come from deep within your stomach. Work on inhaling for eight counts and exhaling for eight counts., Try the book method. Lie on the ground and place a book on your stomach. Sing a comfortable note, and when you are exhaling/singing, try to make the book rise., To sing well, you need to learn how to gather a lot of air with a quick inhalation. To practice this, begin by breathing in and pretending that the air is heavy. Allow it to fall deeply within your body. Then, breathe in faster, still imagining the air as heavy, but let it fall deeply into your body at a faster rate. Continue to do this until you can take in a lot of air at a quick pace.You can also practice pretending that your lungs are balloons that you are filling with air.

, You should work towards a smooth and sustained exhalation. To do this, practice exhaling by blowing on a feather. Take a feather and try to blow it in the air with one, long breath. As you are doing this, your abdomen should begin to return to its normal size, but your chest should not collapse. Repeat this exercise until you are comfortable with long, steady exhales.You should feel as if there isn’t any more air in you, and you need more as soon as you finish exhaling.

, Before you begin singing or doing practice exercises, it's always best to warm up. Sing in your middle range, then low range, then high range, and back to middle. Relax, then try again carefully. If you feel your voice begin to strain, stop and give yourself some time to rest., Even the simplest use of dynamics will make your songs come alive. The more you practice, the louder and softer you'll be able to sing healthily. Start singing a comfortable pitch and then crescendo to loud then decrescendo to soft. When you start out, you will probably only be able to sing from mp (mezzo piano or moderately quiet) to mf (mezzo forte or moderately loud), but your range will increase with practice., Sing from do to sol, back to do quickly back and forth, trying to hit all of the notes. Do this in increments of half steps on different syllables. This will help your voice become more flexible., Practice all of your vowels at every pitch (high, low, and in between). There are very few pure vowels in English. Normally, you will encounter diphthongs which are two or more vowel sounds joined together.Some pure vowels to practice are: AH as in ""father"", EE as in ""eat"", IH as in ""pin"", EH as in ""pet"", OO as in ""food"", UH as in ""nut"", EU as in ""could"", OH as in ""home"".

, Practice this often, especially if you have pitch problems. Most coaches will recommend 20-30 minutes a day when starting out, as practicing scales will also strengthen the muscles used for singing and give you better control. To practice scales, identify your range (tenor, baritone, alto, soprano, etc.) and know how to find the notes that cover your range on a keyboard or piano. Then practice the major scales in every key, moving up and down using the vowel sounds., To improve your singing voice, it is important to practice every day. Practicing singing is similar to exercising your body. If you take a long break from exercising, your stamina and overall ability suffers until you start practicing again. Even if you only have time to practice warm ups in the car on the way to work, that is okay.If possible, set aside a specific time every day for practicing. For example, if you know you will have time 9am to 10am, then mark in your daily planner that you will use that time for practicing.

, Instrumentalists may be able to practice for hours at a time, but that isn’t the case for singers. You will strain your voice if you use it too much. Try to practice anywhere between thirty and sixty minutes a day. You should not practice for more than sixty minutes. The time you practice may fluctuate due to things like illness and fatigue.Do not push yourself if you feel that you can’t practice for thirty minutes.

, There are hundreds of vocal training videos on YouTube, filled with everything from amateur tipsters to educated, professional singers. It can be tricky finding a good vocal trainer on the internet, but it's a great way to find out if you like being taught how to sing. Look through vocal training channels and research which channels provide the most legitimate information.Be careful because not all of the information is correct and even if you find good information, there is a chance you will misinterpret the instructions. This is why a teacher or vocal coach is preferred.

, There are also a few at-home vocal training courses out there, such as Singing Success, Sing and See, Singorama, and Vocal Release. They are not as costly as in-person vocal lessons, but be sure to do your research to see which ones have worked for other singers., If you are dedicated to singing, consider taking professional lessons. Find a vocal coach or qualified voice teacher who can help you become a better singer. Check with your local music store or your school music teacher for trustworthy references.Lessons can be costly. Consider how important singing is to you before signing up for lessons.

, If you cannot afford a teacher, or do not want the dedication that comes with hiring a professional voice coach, consider joining a local choir. Choirs are often associated with the church, but you can find choirs outside of religious organizations. Choirs are a great way to learn about singing and engaging with a community.Keep in mind that you may have to audition to join the choir.

Don't lose your vibrato.,

Get a vocal coach.",How to Belt," You wouldn't try to shoot a basketball sitting down on the couch, would you? Well, you could, but the result probably wouldn't be too great. And the exact same thing goes for singing! Hold your head up, place your feet shoulder width apart with one a bit in front of the other, and relax your arms at your sides. Keep that up!


Be conscious of how you stand. Do you tense up your shoulders or lock your knees out of habit? Do you slouch a little or rest all your weight on one side? These tips may sound nitpicky, but at the end of the day they can be the difference between an okay sound and a great sound.;
, Your shoulders shouldn't be doing any work. If you've worked with a coach before, you know they're big on you being centered. That means you are breathing and getting energy from your core. So breathe deep and fill those lungs -- you're gonna need that air to power those notes.


If you're not sure if you're breathing from your diaphragm, try this test: lay down. Place a book on your chest and breathe. If the book is moving, you're not breathing from your diaphragm! Try to keep the book completely, 100% steady.

, Seriously. These notes will only come if you're totally relaxed. Most people hold unconscious tension on one side more than the other, so shake out your legs, grab your butt and shake it around (seriously!), and resume the position. Your mind is tension-free, too, right?


If you need to, disengage your mind. Find a spot on the wall and think about it. Think about the mere existence of that smudge. Focus on the air in front of you or your finger. It's only when you stop listening to yourself that you can stop that nasty autocorrect inside of you. And for the record, that autocorrect you have isn't any better than your phone's. You sound better when you don't consciously try to change your sound. It needs to be natural!

, There's a lot of metaphor in singing, but this isn't one of them. The sound literally needs to be forward in your mouth, coming out of the mask on your face. If that's confusing, experiment making sounds -- you'll know it when you find it. Try holding a finger in front of your mouth and singing at it; does that help? It should!


Another trick is to speak the words and then sing them just how you spoke them. At least as English speakers, the majority of our words are said fairly forward; mimicking that helps tell our brains what we need to do.

, This, however, is one of the metaphors. It's one of those things that singers get; if you've spent a while working on your voice, you may know what this means. The best way to visualize it is seeing the notes come out of the top of your head. For some reason, that imagery can be quite effective.


Sometimes we also have a tendency to get quite nasal; if you hear your voice leaning in that direction, remind yourself to ""open up."" You should hear a change in your sound automatically -- something that's more natural and less covered in gunk, if you will.

, Really. If you're in your bedroom and you're concerned about the 'rents hearing you, it's not gonna happen. Well, it may happen, but it'll probably be a bit squeaky and it'll hurt. Rest assured there are thousands of 14-year-old girls across the world doing just that right now. Wait until everyone is gone and you can roar. Louder, louder than a lion. You've got the eye of a tiger, a fighter, you're dancing through the fire and they're gonna hear your roar...but way better than Katy Perry does.


No, belting isn't about being loud. Being loud doesn't mean you're doing it right. But, by necessity, belting is loud. But there's so much more to it than that! It still needs to be a beautiful, spinning sound.

, We're talking a solid three, maybe four fingers up and down. It's a bad habit of many of us to relax and sing away as we normally do, but to hit those notes, a mouth that's open wider finds them more easily. So open up! Your mouth and your head!


To streamline your sound (like soundwaves punching the wall in front of you), keep your tongue near the back of your bottom teeth. Be careful to keep a curve in your tongue and not to spatulate it (flatten it, much like a spatula); if you do, it'll change the sound and make you more akin to Britney Spears. Successful, yes, but not the singer you want to be emulating.

, That's that regular, pulsating of the pitch you hear when you hold a note out. It's easy to scream in your chest voice on a straight tone, sure. But heads up: that's not belting. That's...well, that's screaming like a girl. If you hit a note, make sure your vibrato is in tact. It shouldn't be a machine gun, and it shouldn't be vibrating like a snail -- aim for somewhere in between. Two quick things about your vibrato while belting:


It doesn't involve moving your mouth. At all. Those women you see who look like their jaws are being electrocuted are faking it to get the sound they think sounds good. It needs to be in your throat, a natural part of your voice.
If you can hit the note on a straight tone, you can hit it with vibrato. Just imagine the note spinning. If your vibrato is too slow or not there at all, you can take your finger to your throat and manipulate your voice box manually. That'll get the habit started for you.

, Belting takes stamina. Don't let anyone tell you that singing isn't a sport! If you keep doing it, you'll develop more endurance, your breathing will come easier, and those notes will be more attainable. Nothing good comes overnight, you know?


All your singing should be mindful and you should be rocking the correct posture and mouth positioning at all times, not just when you're belting. If you practice incorrect form, you'll just make bad habits. It's perfect practice that makes perfect -- not just practice.

, We're not kidding. If it hurts, you're doing it wrong. If it hurts, you risk developing nodes. If it hurts, you will lose your voice and maybe not just temporarily. So if you feel your voice getting scratchy or those notes you could hit 20 minutes ago aren't coming so easily anymore, take a break. You can revisit it again tomorrow.


In general, you should not practice belting for long periods of time. Keeping with the basketball analogy -- would you play basketball for hours and hours on end and expect to get better? No. After a while, your body just wears out and you start doing worse. It's the same with singing!

, This is actually quite the skill -- it's harder than belting, and it's definitely harder than just relying on your head voice. A mixed belt is when you use both registers simultaneously. It's your head voice, but with a twang. And it sounds so much like a belt that many people refer to it as a ""healthy belt.""This involves first strengthening your head voice. If you don't have that (if you've been concentrating on your belt, you won't), you'll need to work on the head voice first. Then you can transition from your head to your chest unnoticed -- using your mixed belt in between.

, Loads. It should be room temperature -- too cold and it'll shrink up your vocal folds and too hot and it could scorch them. Room temperature water keeps them loose, hydrated and relaxed. And it's good for the rest of your body, too!


If your voice starts to hurt (you've stopped, right?), consider going for some warm tea or gargling saltwater. But whatever you do, again, make sure it's not too hot. Warmth is enough to reap the soothing benefits of the water or tea.

, It can be expensive, but the absolute best thing you can do for your voice is to get a vocal coach. They'll ensure that everything you're doing is safe and healthy and, most importantly, sustainable. You don't want to be one of those declining divas in ten years due to poor singing habits! So ask around. Just an hour a week oughta do it!


If money is tight, consider hitting up your local college or university. Often vocal majors have to do some sort of pedagogy where they train students for free or for a very reduced price to complete their major. And it's a great way to meet friends with similar interests!

Prepare your glass shattering station.,
Put on safety goggles/glasses to protect your eyes.,
Find the resonant frequency of your glass.,
Maintain the resonant frequency in your mind.,
Aim for a loud volume a pure resonant pitch.",How to Break a Glass with Your Voice1," Remember, success in this task will result in broken glass, so you might want to practice in a room with hard floors to make clean up easier. Choose a room with good acoustics and little to no echo. You’ll also need a power outlet to plug in your amp if you've chosen to use a microphone, as well as a platform on which your glass and amp can sit.


If you plan on using your voice alone to shatter your glass, you'll only need a sturdy platform to place your glass upon. The platform should be relatively high so that you can stand while singing to get the best volume and tone.Lay down a large drop cloth if you attempt this in a carpeted area. Small splinters of glass can become embedded in carpet and cause harm later. A drop cloth will keep shattered glass from getting in your carpet.
When using an amp and microphone, the amp should be placed facing your glass and relatively close to it. A sturdy coffee table might be sufficient to hold both speaker and glass while limiting distorting vibrations, though the ground might also work well. Try to position your amp so it isn’t blasting sound in the direction of people who might be bothered by it, like your neighbors.
Your glass should be directly in front of the amplifier's speaker. Look through the material covering the front of your amplifier and find the exact location of the speaker cone. Position your glass right in front of the cone.;
, Shattering glass can produce very small fragments that can cause permanent damage to your eyes. Wearing simple eye protection, like safety glasses or goggles, will prevent this from happening.


If you don’t happen to have protective eyewear handy, you could use a pair of cheap sunglasses or swimming goggles. Be sure that your eye protection covers your entire eye. Half-lens reading glasses will not be adequate., Flick the glass with your fingernail gently and listen carefully to the ringing sound. This is the resonant frequency of your glass, and you will have to match and sustain this pitch to cause it to break. It may help you to hold onto the pitch if you hum it softly to yourself even after the glass has finished ringing.


You can also cause your glass to hum its resonant frequency by moistening your finger and rubbing it along the rim of your glass. Circle the rim of the glass with your finger until it resonates audibly. Then try to hold that pitch in your head.
You may find using an instrument or tool, like a piano or a pitch finder, can help you identify, hold, and narrow in on the resonant frequency while you’re trying to sing.
Empty your glass completely, remove decorations from it, and place it on a sturdy, regular surface while you are checking its resonant frequency. Things that are inside, on top of, or connected to your glass could alter this tone., Holding a pitch in your head for a period of time usually results in a flat pitch.A flat resonant pitch won't make your glass shatter. To help prevent yourself from going flat, you may want to hum along or sustain the note with some kind of tool, like an instrument, pitch pipe, or pitch finder/tuner. Hearing very slight differences in tone can be difficult even for talented musicians.


Check your pitch frequently as you attempt to shatter the glass with your voice. Simply flick the bulb of the glass gently with your fingernail, listen carefully to the resulting tone, and tweak your pitch to match it.

, Professional vocalists and opera singers are generally the people who attempt this kind of feat due to their vocal strength. You'll need to at least reach a volume of 100 - 110 decibels and match the resonant pitch perfectly for several seconds if you're going to shatter a glass. This can be a difficult feat if you are untrained, in which case you might use a microphone.


The 100 - 110 decibel range is similar to the noise produced by a nearby power mower, power saw, or motorcycle. To shatter glass, you'll have to reach this volume or louder while singing the resonant pitch."
"
Place your mouth close to the glass.,
Sing the resonant frequency pitch.,
Attempt shattering different glasses.,
Dispose of the broken glass carefully when you succeed.",How to Break a Glass with Your Voice2," With enough practice and vocal strength, you should be able to shatter a glass from a more comfortable distance. Most normal people, however, will have difficulty sustaining the volume necessary for breaking a glass. Being very close will focus your sound energy and give you the best chance possible of making it break.


To check just how loud you are singing, you might want to download a sound measuring app from the app store on your phone or buy a sound level meter from an online retailer. If you notice that, even at your loudest, you're nowhere close to the 100 - 110 decibel range, you might want to consider using a microphone., Begin singing the resonant tone at a normal speaking volume. Listen carefully to the sound of your voice. Does it sound sharp (above the resonant pitch) or flat (below the resonant pitch)? If so, make slight adjustments to your tone. When you are confident that you are singing the pitch perfectly, slowly increase your singing volume into you are singing as loudly as you can.


If you feel discomfort, pain, or notice a significant change in the quality of your voice, you may be straining your voice by singing too loudly or too long. To prevent permanent damage, you should stop immediately, drink some water. Hold off singing until your voice is back to normal.Vowel sounds will be less obstructed, enabling you to achieve higher volumes. In particular, the ""ee"" vowel sound has the highest volume rating. The vowel “ay” is also rated very highly for volume.
Sustain your note as long as possible while making slight adjustments. Even if you hit the resonant frequency dead-on, you’ll have to hold the pitch perfectly for a few seconds before the glass vibrates enough to shatter. More likely you’ll have to “slide” your voice slightly up and down and make slight adjustments to match the resonant pitch.

, Some glasses will have more microscopic imperfections than others. More imperfections in the glass means you’ll have a better chance of causing it to shatter. By rotating between several different glasses, it’s more likely that at least one will have the imperfections you need to break the glass.


You might also want to try glasses of various shape and size. Be sure you check the resonant frequency of each glass with a flick of your nail; each glass will have its own slightly different resonant frequency.

, Wear gloves when cleaning up to prevent yourself from getting cuts or scraped by a sharp edge. Then examine the area thoroughly to make sure you've picked up even the smallest fragments. A flashlight can help you spot small slivers.


You may want to avoid using a vacuum cleaner to suck up your glass fragments. Doing so can cause damage to your vacuum. Instead, sweep up as much as possible with a broom, and capture tiny slivers by pressing a piece of bread into the fragments."
"
Protect your hearing.,
Prepare your amplifier.,
Adjust the volume of your amp.,
Sing into the microphone.,
Dispose of the broken glass carefully.",How to Break a Glass with Your Voice3," The amplifier will need to be turned up fairly loud in order for this to work, so you should protect your ears from potentially harmful sound levels. A good pair of earplugs might be sufficient, but for very loud volumes, specialty sound dampening ear protectors might be best. , Plug in and switch on your amp. You should hear a faint tone caused by the electricity running through it. This means your amp is ready for input. Take the cord end of your mic and plug its audio jack into your amp.


You’ll also need to plug a microphone into your amplifier. You should place your mic as far away from the amplifier as the cable will allow to prevent distortion and mic feedback.
Use a microphone stand if you have one available. Singing hands free will allow you to focus more intensely on the task at hand.
Remember to wear your ear protection. Also, to minimize your exposure to loud volumes, you should stand behind the amp, or behind it and off to the side.
If your mic doesn’t work, check it for an on/off switch. If your mic is already switched on but still is not working, check the audio jack to make sure your it is fully connected to the speaker.

, If you are using an unfamiliar amp, test its volume at a medium level before attempting to put it on the maximum setting. Most glasses will require you to reach a minimum of 100 to 110 decibels, which is about the volume of a passing motorbike, a nearby car horn, or the music in a nightclub.You may want to layer the wall your amp is pointed at with sound dampening material, like heavy blankets or cushions. This will prevent the loudness of your amp from aggravating others.
Other sound dampening measures you might make use of include acoustic panels, soundproof curtains, and other techniques.

, You’ll want to save your voice from unnecessary strain by singing at a soft to moderate volume. Slide your voice in very small increments around the resonant pitch until you feel confident that you have it perfectly. Then increase your volume until you are singing into the microphone directly at a moderate volume.


If your glass refuses to break, check your pitch with a pitch finder. The pitch you are singing might only be off a slight bit, but this can prevent your glass from breaking.
Vowels are less obstructed and will help you to achieve louder volumes. In particular, the ""ee"" vowel sound has the highest volume rating. The vowel “ay” is also rated very highly for volume.
Sustain your note as long as possible while making slight adjustments. Even if you hit the resonant frequency dead-on, you’ll have to hold the pitch perfectly for a few seconds before the glass vibrates enough to shatter.Since you are using amplification, you shouldn’t need to shout into the microphone. Speaking loudly puts strain on your voice and can do permanent damage if you’re not careful. Sing into the microphone at a moderate volume and take a break whenever your voice feels tired., A pair of rubber gloves will help prevent you from getting any nicks or cuts from the glass while cleaning. You may want to use a flashlight to help you find difficult to see fragments. Pick up and throw away large pieces of glass with your hands, sweep up smaller fragments, and use care when vacuuming. Glass fragments may cause damage to your vacuum cleaner.A common trick for picking up small shard and slivers of glass uses a slice of soft sandwich bread. Press your bread into the floor wherever you see glass. The glass should get caught into the bread, which you can throw away when the glass is clean or the piece of bread is full of glass. You may need to use several pieces of bread to clean the entire area.

Research and download a software.,
Experiment with beats.,
Play with a bass line.,
Add supporting parts.,
Record a song.",How to Create Your Own R&B Beats1," There are tons of different softwares available to write music and beats. Before you download something, take some time to research softwares. Some things to consider is the price of the software, operating system of your computer, quality of beats you want, and ease of the software.


Ask fellow beat producers what software they prefer. You could also reach out, via email, to some of your favorite music producers. You never know until you ask.
One of the easiest softwares that has become an industry standard is Fruity Loops. The reason why several artists start with Fruity Loops is because the software is free and easy to use. It is a good idea to download something free to get a basic feeling for composing beats.
Another industry standard is Ableton Live and Reason. You can get a feeling for these softwares by downloading a free trial of the program. This way you can decide if the software is the right fit for you.;
, The best way to start with the software is to practice making drum loops. All softwares set up drum loops differently, but they usually use the same layout. Open a drum kit on the software and access the piano roll. The piano roll is where you can arrange different parts of the drum kit like bass, snare, hi hat, etc. Set the piano roll to loop so the beat repeats itself.


Play around with different parts of the drum kit until you find a beat that you like.An easy way to build a beat is by beginning with the bass drum.

, Sort through the different bass sounds on the software. Bass is integral to R&B music. The music software should have plenty of synthesizer bass sounds. Pick one out and practice playing a line over the beat. You can opt for a simple beat similar to the way Wu-Tang uses bass lines, or compose something more complex.


Once you find a fun melody, record and loop the bass line to match the drum beat.
Simple bass lines tend to be the most catchy for an R&B song.
Use the piano roll to arrange the notes of the bass line like you did for the beat.

, Once the rhythm section of the beat is in motion, it’s time to add additional melodies and chords. Find a good keyboard sound and experiment with layering chords over the rhythm. You don’t need to be an expert at piano to find some chord shapes that sounds decent over the rhythm.


Try playing a variation of a major 7th chord in the key of the bass. You can find the key easily by matching the notes of the chord with the notes from the bass' piano roll
Look through the lead synthesizers and pick out tones that matches the sound of the beat. Try improvising a solo over the looped parts.You can also experiment with supporting percussion parts such as adding a bell, hand drums, or a tambourine.

, Recording in a music software is different depending on what software you use. You should have a few variations of the same beat and bassline before recording the track. Mess around with playing one beat, pausing the beat, and then playing a new beat with a new bass line.


Some softwares live Ableton Live, have two different modes: live mode and recording mode. It is easier to build the supporting parts of the beat in the live mode. Once you have a few variations of each part, switch over to the record setting to try recording the beat.
You can’t create a good beat without trying and failing a R&B beat. Every musician creates something corny before recording something good.

As you inhale and exhale, try to inflate your stomach and kidney (back) areas with your breath. To ensure that you’re breathing into these areas, place your hands around your waist, with your thumbs on your back, your fingers at your front, and your palms resting on your sides down towards your hips. You should feel your hands expand and contract with each breath. Over time, as you strengthen your breath, these expansions and contractions will get bigger and longer.
If you have trouble breathing deeply, try lying on the floor on your back, with your hands on your stomach. When you inhale, your hands should rise; when you exhale, your hands should lower.Note that your shoulders should not be moving up and down with your breath.;
, When you’re breathing correctly, when you inhale, the lower muscles (diaphragm) over your abdomen should move outward, making room for more air. As you sing (or talk or just exhale), use those muscles to push the air back out.


Use the muscles over your lower back (around your kidneys) in exactly the same way to control your inhalations and exhalations.

, Pay attention to the position of your feet, knees, hips, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, and head:Your feet should be slightly apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other so that your weight is slightly forward.
Your knees should be relaxed and slightly bent. When aiming for good posture it can be tempting to lock your knees; be careful not to do this.
Your hands should be relaxed and hanging at your sides.
Your abdomen should be relaxed but ready to be engaged. To get a sense of how an engaged abdomen feels, place your hands on your waist (with your thumbs on your back) and cough very lightly.
Your shoulders should slide back and down so that your back is straight and your head is high. Do not hunch or pull your shoulders up towards your ears.
Your chest should be slightly up and out— this will likely happen naturally when you pull your shoulders back and down.
Your chin should be parallel with the floor — neither lifted or pointed downward.

, Once you’ve moved into the correct posture, check in to make sure that you are not holding tension anywhere. It should not feel as though you’re forcing your chest out or your back to be straight. Be sure to relax your face and your neck.


Singing or speaking while your body and face are tensed will only make it more difficult to produce a high-quality sound.

, Your mouth should be wide open when you sing, but avoid the temptation to open it so wide that your face and neck muscles tense up. Check in to make sure that your lips, jaw, and neck feel loose and relaxed.

, A common piece of advice from professional singers is to create space in your mouth. Opening your mouth wide is part of how you can do this; another part of creating space involves dropping your jaw and tongue, and lifting your soft palate (the ridged flesh at the roof of your mouth).


To do this, breathe in as you would before yawning, but try not to yawn. Pay attention to the space this creates in your mouth, including the open feeling at the back of your throat. You want to replicate this wide-mouthed, soft-jawed/lifted palate position when singing., When creating space in your mouth, make sure that your tongue is out of the way. Let it rest softly at the bottom of your mouth, with its tip touching the back of your lower teeth.


Try not to stick your tongue out or wave it around while you’re singing, as this will impair the quality of your voice, and could reduce the richness of your tone.

, Too much saliva in your mouth might make it difficult to sing, so remember to swallow before starting!

, Before singing or doing more demanding vocal exercises, you’ll benefit from doing some of the following simple exercises to warm up your voice:Yawn. Yawning will help stretch and open your mouth and throat, and can help release tension in your neck and diaphragm. To trigger a yawn, try opening your mouth wide and breathing in.Cough very gently. Think of it as lightly pushing air out from the back of your throat in short bursts. This will help you engage your lower chest and abdominal muscles, which are the muscles you should use while singing (as opposed to your throat/upper chest).Do gentle lip rolls. Hold your lips lightly together and blow air out of them while humming. Focus on having a relaxed throat and an engaged core while you do this. Practise lip rolls going from a low to high note and vice versa. Once you’re used to the lip rolls, practise doing scales with them.To help your body learn to relax while you sing, tense up your body and then right after releasing the tension, do a lip roll from low to high; repeat, this time going high to low.Humming is another gentle way to warm up your voice. Try humming along with music on your way to school or work or, if you’d prefer not to do that sort of thing in public, hum while you cook or while you’re in the shower., Starting as low as you can comfortably sing, gently move up the scale using a “me” sound until you reach the highest note at which you are comfortable. Then, move down the scale from high to low using an “e” sound.Don’t push your range — be gentle with it, letting it increase over time.
You can also do this with an “oo” sound.

, Your mouth should look as though you’re sucking in a long string of spaghetti as you inhale. When you exhale, make a “woo” sound. It should sound buzzy, similar to the sound made by a kazoo. Keep the sound steady as you exhale; do this 2 to 3 times.Next, go up and down your scales using the “woo” sound.

, Say groups of single words or entire phrases without stopping between the words — treat them as a single word. Lengthen the vowels and exaggerate the vocalization of each word as you say and/or sing it.As you speak/sing, imaging that you’re filling a room with your voice.
Focus on smooth transitions: when switching between higher and lower, and louder and softer parts of a song, imagine moving up and down a ramp — not a staircase.
Example words: moon moan mourn mane mean.Example phrases: many men munch many melons, A lot of vocal exercises can sound and look pretty funny. Relax and have fun with it. Two fun and silly exercises that help open up your throat:


Sing “meow” slowly, emphasizing its three sounds — mee, ahh, and ooo.
Make weird faces by stretching out your tongue in all directions. You can do this while singing or even just making weird noises.

, As with physical exercise, cooling down after doing vocal exercises is important. One way to cool down is to do the same simple vocal warm-ups you started with (for example, yawning, light coughing, rolling your lips, and humming).Another way to cool down is simply to gently glide up and down, and down and up, on the sound “m”, so that you feel a tickling vibration in your lip/nose area., Whether you're warming up, singing, or giving a speech, breathing deeply and keeping your body, throat, and face relaxed are key to ensuring a high-quality voice.

, Drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day — more if you exercise or live somewhere hot (i.e. if you sweat a lot)., Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables promote a healthy voice by keeping the mucus membranes that line your throat healthy., These include smoke (even second-hand smoke), spicy foods, milk products, foods with a high-salt content (ex., bacon or salted nuts), citrus fruits, alcohol (including mouthwashes that contain alcohol), and cold and allergy medications., If you body is fatigued, it will show in your voice.Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night; teenagers should aim for 8.5 to 9.5 hours each night.If you get at least 7.5 hours of sleep each night and do not wake up feeling refreshed, see your doctor to ensure that there are no underlying reasons for this., Stress affects everything negatively. Take time every day to do something that helps you relax. Relaxing activities include yoga, meditation, walking, watching a show you love, reading a good book, or playing an instrument.

, This is particularly important if you have a performance coming up. Shouting can strain your voice and diminish its quality for even a few days after.

, If the quality of your voice has recently diminished — for example, become raspy, deeper, or strained — it may be a sign that you are experiencing a health issue. To be on the safe side, see a doctor to rule out potential health issues., It could take some time to improve the quality of your voice. You won’t see enormous overnight results, but you likely will feel some difference almost immediately after combining proper breathing and posture with some simple warmups.


It’s okay to take it slow. Start with learning how to breathe more deeply and stand correctly. Once you’re comfortable with that, work on your mouth position and some simple warm-ups.

, A good teacher can give you detailed feedback and advice on how to improve your voice. Aim for someone with classical training, as a classically trained teacher is likely to have experience with a variety of styles.If you can’t afford a voice coach, there are many online lessons available for free. Just type “singing lessons” or “voice coach” into YouTube, and you’ll have a wealth of videos to choose from.

, Listen to the way they handle their breath, volume, articulation, control, vocal habits, and resonance. If you’re particularly fond of their style, see if you can replicate it.


Replicating someone’s style is a great way of learning to sing, because it forces you to try things you might not normally try when singing.

, Pay attention to how they breathe and support the notes with their breath. Note their posture and body language. Watch the way they use their lips to shape the sounds and words that they are singing.

, Think about why you dislike a certain singer or speaker. What do they do differently from the ones you like? Are they doing something wrong or is it just not your style?

, It is amazing what a good sound engineer can accomplish during a recording session. If you really like an artist's recordings, try to figure out how much is real and how much is engineered before you decide that ""you can never sound as good as that!""

, Ask those whose voice you like what they are doing to get that sound. Most will be flattered and pleased to share this information with you.

Put it all together and practice.",How to Figure Out a Song by Ear," Pay attention whilst you listen to the song. Identify the number of different parts and if any of them repeat. This makes up song structure. If a song goes: opening, verse, chorus, verse, and ends on the chorus, then you basically have three different parts to learn.


The song structure is important because some songs can actually just have one riff or chord progression played throughout. Other songs have non chorus based structure.
Listen to your chosen song all the way through without pausing it. Are there parts to the song that sound harder to learn than others? Or, if you're learning with technology, are there certain parts you might find hard to create? If any of these answers is yes, consider starting off with an easier and shorter song.;
, Some genres are much harder to learn than others. For example, Dubstep is harder to learn than RnB because you have to use certain technology and effects to create it.


If you're a pianist, consider learning Pop and Classical songs first.
If you are in a band or would like to be in a band, consider learning Rock, Metal, Country or Folk.
If you are into the charts, or would like to be a DJ, consider learning Hip Hop, Urban RnB, DnB, Dubstep and Electronica.

, Always try to use headphones or shut yourself in an empty room. And don't ask everyone what song your playing.

, Always try to use headphones or shut yourself in an empty room.

, Note down in your head any memorable melodies and bass lines. Or, if it's a technology genre, note down any effects or uses of technologies.

, If the song has lyrics, consider listening to instrumentals of your chosen song. It will be much easier to hear the specific instruments. Always note down what you can hear. Do you notice any patterns? Are there any pauses or breaks?

, Listen for any changes to these. In some music this is bound to be frequent so always take your time when trying to learn. Don't rush and don't give up.

, This requires figuring out the bassline. This is helpful because you can easily see what key the song is in. Once that's done, you can apply some theory to help get the right chords. Since songs use scales (mostly major), each successive chord on the 7 intervals of the scale will use the notes of the scale used in that specific key. In other words, in the key of E, your notes will be E, F#, G#, A, B, C#,and D#, and those are the notes you have to use to apply the 1-3-5 chord form onto each interval of the scale. That would mean your chords used on the 1 to 7 intervals would be E, F# minor, G#minor, A, B, C#minor, and D# diminished (a minor chord with a flattened fifth). Of course, musicians often substitute other chord variations like suspended chords (substitute the 3rd. for the 2nd. or 4th.) or dominant seventh chords (a major chord with a flattened 7th.), but knowing how to figure out chords with theory is very helpful.

, Don't pay any attention to the notes or chords (even though you have already learned them). Figure out the rhythm by tapping your foot to the beat or tapping your fingers on something to get the rhythm.

, Note down any effects used on the melody, such as reverb, EQ and delay. In dance music, this is frequent.

, If you have already figured out everything else, then you know what key the song is in and should be able to get the lead work pretty easily. Moreover, if the song does not have any solo parts, you can just add them using some simple scales. Try to play the solo part using pentatonic scales first. Be sure your solo is based on the main melody of the song. Then add some more improvements with slide, bend and vibration techniques.

, If it's of the technology, genre then look for tutorials on how to create certain parts and effects that you can't do with your chosen instrument.

Research and purchase a sampler or drum machine.,
Program settings on your device.,
Program the device for a full song.,
Practice a beat live.,
Invite a singer or rapper to collaborate.",How to Create Your Own R&B Beats2," There are dozens of samplers that can produce high quality beats without a computer. Some artists prefer to leave the computer out of their work flow. There are two basic categories that sometimes get mixed together: samplers and sequencers. You’ll need to purchase one of these if you don’t want to solely use your computer. Check out a music store before purchasing equipment.


Samplers are good for taking samples, for example, a clip of a song, a guitar riff, monks chanting, or just a snare hit.
Sequencers are good for adjusting the beat live and are set up the similar to a piano roll on a computer.
Try to go into the store to test the product out before making a purchase. There is a lot of competition for these types of products, so you should be able to find one that fits your needs., Once you get your machine, you should play with it! Experiment and learn some of the device’s functions by using the presets. Presets will teach you about the functions and capabilities of the device.


Once you find a preset you like, modify individual parts of the preset to create a new sound.
Upload different sounds to your device to create unique sounds.
If your device can store samples, try uploading loops of older songs. It is popular for R&B to sample 1960s and 1970s era soul and funk.

, Once you've built a few loops and supporting parts for the beat, you can attempt to program a full track. Sequence a channel to have 16 bars for the verse and 8 bars for the chorus. A bar is a small amount of time, typically containing a full measure of the beat.You could also include a bridge, intro, and outro to add complexities to your track.The 16 bars is merely a starting place. You can add more or less to your liking.

, Once you get the feeling for the device, try performing your as though you had a crowd. You don’t need to showcase your music to anyone before you're ready. Start the beat simple and gradually add different parts to create a textured R&B track.


Plug the device into a keyboard amp or a P.A. for the best sound.
You could also record a demo of your beat or live set using a field recorder.

, Once you become comfortable using your device, play with fellow artists. You’ll feel a greater sense of pressure when performing with another artist. Work out a song by planning different parts of the song using a pen and paper. Agree to do one thing during the verse, and then do something different during the chorus.


Write down the setting you’re using on the machine so you’ll remember what you are playing.

"
Know what you need.,
Understand your keyboard.,
Get a feeling for the drums.,
Understand chords and basic melodies.,
Record the track.",How to Create Your Own R&B Beats3," R&B beats require smooth instruments. These include pianos, guitars, harps, violins, etc. You also have harder sounds like trumpets and lead synths that can be used to add emphasis to a part. Synthesizers are being used for R&B beats more than other instruments.


Having access to a studio with multiple instruments will benefit you best for creating a beat live.
Recruit musicians to help you write and record beats live.

, A lot of music in R&B is made using a keyboard. Keyboard is a good way to compose different parts of the song. If you want to create a demo for other musicians to play to, record all the parts you’re imagining in your head.


Keyboards have all the octaves that you could need for a song.
Midi keyboards allow you to play software instruments on the keys. For example, you can play an accordion through your midi keys.

, Make sure your drums are fit for the type of track you are making. For slower tracks use a combination of the ride, soft snare, and auxiliary percussion like a shaker or tambourine. For quicker beats go for a more pop feel with heavier snare, kick,, crash, and toms.


Most R&B music has a smooth beat that is held together by the drums and bass.
Listen to multiple styles of R&B to get a better understanding for R&B drums. Listen to The Ohio Players, Funkadelic, and any era of James Brown.

, A lot of beats are made starting with a simple melody, like a bass line or a catchy lead line. The beat comes into fruition by adding harmony with other instruments like the keyboard, guitar, or a woodwind instrument. If you are playing with several musicians, communicate when something sounds good.


Popular chords for R&B are major 7th chords. Experiment with an arrangement with major 7th chords, and see if it works. If you have a composition with major chords, add the 7th to add a smoother sound to the arrangement.
Once the beat and melody come into place, be sparse with additional parts.
Subtly is an underrated trait in music that will sound good., After everyone agrees on their parts of the song to play, you’re ready to record the track. You can either record the song yourself, or go into a recording studio. It is rare for contemporary R&B to be played on live instruments, but that doesn’t mean it won’t sound good. Consider recording a few demos from home before going out and recording at a studio.


Plenty of softwares that can make beats also have recording capabilities built into them. This is a good way to incorporate a live bass player into a mostly electronic beat. To record on a software you'll need an interface and a microphone.If you decide to go to a studio, be sure you can play your songs flawlessly. It is important to be on top of your sound before recording with a producer.
Another popular way to make a demo is by using a four track recorder. Four track recorders can be limiting, but oftentimes the limitations of a four track can benefit the songwriting process.

Typically you'll give them a title, such as ""Artist"" or ""Songwriter"" and ""Publisher,"" which will be used throughout the rest of the agreement.In addition to identifying the parties by name, the first paragraph of your contract also provides the date the agreement goes into effect. This may be the same day the parties sign the contract, or it may be a later date.
Established publishers typically have a standard agreement that they use, and simply enter specific details such as the name of the songwriter, compositions covered, and the term of the agreement.
You may be able to find sample contracts that you can use as a guide to write and better understand the clauses and terms included in a standard music publishing contract.
After the first paragraph identifying the parties, a standard music publishing contract typically includes a number of ""whereas"" clauses. These clauses begin with the word ""whereas"" and describe the general purpose that the two parties are entering into an agreement with each other.;
, Some music publishing contracts grant the publisher an exclusive publishing right, which relates to the entire output of the songwriter for the duration of the contract. Others only last for a specific term.Where a publishing contract lasts for a specific term, it typically continues for several years.
Contracts set to expire after a number of years usually also include options for renewal. These options periods are triggered on a certain date and may give the publisher the right of first refusal – meaning when the contract expires, the songwriter must give the publisher the opportunity to renew the contract before he or she goes shopping for another publisher.
Keep in mind that the term of the contract is separate from the copyright assignment. Some contracts may not include a specific term because the copyright is assigned for the life of the copyright (the life of the songwriter plus 70 years). With these agreements, the contract's ""term"" technically ends when the songwriter has delivered the songs or copyrights to the publisher.

, If a music publishing contract only relates to specific songs in the songwriter's repertoire, rather than all songs written within a period of time, your music publishing contract should list those songs.With publishing contracts known as ""exclusive songwriter agreements,"" also called ""staff writer"" contracts, a songwriter grants rights to the publisher for all songs he or she writes during a specific period of time.
A publisher signing an exclusive songwriter agreement is responsible for exploiting that song, meaning the publisher will find a recording artist to record the song. These agreements are more common with songwriters who are not themselves performers or recording artists.
Recording artists who also write their own songs may enter publishing contracts covering specific compositions, or the compositions of all the songs recorded on a specific album.

, When you draft a music publishing contract, both the publisher and the songwriter have duties and responsibilities to each other that should be specifically defined.Generally, the songwriter is responsible for delivering songs to the publisher, and the publisher is responsible for exploiting those songs to earn money for the songwriter and the publisher.
It might help to think of the publisher as an agent for the song. While an artist's agent exploits the artist's career by getting him or her good gigs and promotional opportunities, the publisher exploits the song by getting it into the best position to make money for the songwriter.
For example, the publisher may promote the song to a popular recording artist and get him or her to record the song and make it a hit.

, To perform his or her duties under the contract, the publisher must have the legal right to sign documents in the songwriter's name, including documents related to copyright registration and protection.Typically the power of attorney clause includes a provision that the songwriter must be given the first opportunity to sign any required documents, but that after a set period of time the publisher can sign them if the songwriter isn't able to do so.
Music publishing contracts also generally give the publisher the right to use the songwriter's name and likeness in connection with the printing, sale, and distribution of the composition.

, The music publishing copyright effectively gives the publisher the ability to administer the songwriter's copyrights in the compositions to the songs written during the period of the contract. The publishing contract describes the limits of that copyright assignment.The publisher often has the right to exploit the copyrights in the compositions included in the agreement throughout the world.
However, some publishing contracts may specify that the publisher's rights only extend to a particular geographical area. For example, a songwriter may have one publisher for Europe and another publisher for North America.
The publisher may have the ability to administer the songwriter's copyrights for the lifetime of the copyright, defined as the life of the songwriter plus 70 years. However, the agreement may only last a specified number of years.
There are several different rights included in the composition copyright, and the contract may not grant the publisher the power to exploit all of those rights.
For example, many songwriters reserve their sync rights, which are fees paid when a song is used in connection with a visual image _ such as a song played in the background on a commercial, or a song included on a movie soundtrack.
The songwriter also may enter into a separate publishing contract that solely covers the sync rights in the music compositions. These publishing contracts are far more limited, typically only cover specific songs, and often are non-exclusive.

, The royalty rate is the amount of money the songwriter earns when his or her song is used by someone else. The publisher typically is responsible for collecting these amounts and dispersing them to the songwriter.The contract may describe different rates for different types of uses. For example, the songwriter may earn one royalty rate for the sale of sheet music, and a different rate for the sale of a sync license or performance license.
Some rates are standard and not subject to negotiation. For example, if an artist wants to cover a song previously recorded by someone else, he or she would pay a mechanical license, the rate of which is established in U.S. copyright law.
A standard music publishing contract provides that the songwriter gets 50 percent of the royalties, and the publisher gets the other 50 percent.

, Your contract should establish how often the publisher will send the songwriter a check for royalty payments, including the dates for payments and the period of time that will be covered by each payment.Under most music publishing contracts, the publisher pays the songwriter an advance against future earnings from the song. This advance typically is paid when the publishing contract goes into effect.
The advance is recoupable from royalties earned from the songwriter's compositions over the term of the contract, meaning the songwriter shouldn't expect a royalty check from the publisher until the compositions have earned a greater amount in royalties than the advance the songwriter was initially given.
However, the songwriter will receive a statement on each date a check is supposed to be issued under the contract – typically either monthly or quarterly. The statement details how much the songwriter has earned in royalties and how much of the advance has been repaid.
For example, suppose the publisher gives the songwriter a $100,000 advance. In the first quarter of the contract, the songs covered by the contract earn $20,000 in royalties for the songwriter. The songwriter therefore would receive a statement stating that $20,000 of the advance had been repaid and there was an $80,000 balance on the account still to be repaid.
Once the songwriter earned $100,000 in royalties, a check would accompany the statement.

, Regular audits protect the songwriter and help ensure that royalty rates are being calculated accurately. Your music publishing contract should include basic accounting procedures and specify when the songwriter (or the songwriter's accountant) can audit the publisher's books.Standard music publishing contracts typically allow the songwriter (or the songwriter's accountant) to inspect the books of the publisher at any time.
Conducting a full audit may require advance notice to the publisher.
Each statement that accompanies the monthly or quarterly payments to the songwriter provides a breakdown of the royalties earned and the division of those royalties between the songwriter and the publisher.

, Music publishing contracts typically contain a miscellaneous clause that describes how the contract may be breached and requires notice to the other party before taking further action such as filing a lawsuit.Typically, if either the songwriter or the publisher believes the other has failed to perform their duties under the contract, they must deliver written notice to that effect.
Upon receipt of that written notice, the party alleged to be in breach of the contract has a specific amount of time – usually 10 to 15 days – to either remedy the problem or explain why their actions did not constitute breach of contract.
For example, suppose a songwriter believes her publisher has not paid royalties owed. She sends notice to the publisher telling him that he owes her money. When the publisher receives that notice, he reviews his books and determines the songwriter is correct, so he sends her a check.
Typically this notice procedure must be followed before either party can file a lawsuit alleging breach of contract.

, A music publishing contract typically establishes which forum is appropriate for hearing contract disputes, and which state's law should be used to interpret the contract itself.Music publishing contracts may allow lawsuits in court, or provide arbitration as the exclusive means of settling disputes. If the contract requires arbitration, it typically will outline the procedures for requesting arbitrators and name an arbitration organization which must be used.
The contract also must identify which state's law governs it. Typically a music publishing contract will be governed by the laws of the state where the publisher is located.

, These clauses are standard provisions, or ""boilerplate,"" that are included in all contracts. They typically are not a subject of negotiation because they provide basic protection to both parties.The songwriter warrants that he or she owns the copyrights in the compositions covered by the contract, and that the compositions don't infringe anyone else's copyrights.
He or she also indemnifies, or protects, the publisher against any losses the publisher might incur if it turns out the songwriter doesn't own the copyrights, or one of the compositions infringes someone else's copyrights.
This indemnification provision essentially means that if it turns out one of the compositions infringes someone else's copyrights, the publisher won't be held accountable or forced to pay damages to the person whose copyright was infringed.
The publisher makes warranties and indemnifications as well, related to his or her ability to enter the contract and exploit the copyrights as agreed.

, A lot of singers don't write their own songs, and that's OK. Particularly when you're first starting out, you want people to pay more attention to the quality of your voice than the quality of your songwriting. Build up a ""set list"" of 10 to 15 covers you know you can really knock out of the park, and practice getting better at them.


Choose a good mix of popular and obscure songs. Just as you don't want to focus on only Top 40 hits, you also don't want to be singing only songs that no one recognizes.
Provide a fresh take on a classic. A good way to get a cover noticed is drastically altering the tone, tempo or instrumentation of a popular song. Compare the several different versions of ""Hallelujah,"" or listen to the Civil Wars' cover of Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean.""

, Book as many gigs as you can to get your voice out there - you never know who will be listening in the audience. Sing at private parties, county fairs, store openings, rodeos, sporting events, talent shows, karaoke nights, and anywhere else that will have you, paid or not. Even if you don't get spotted by a talent agent right away, you're practicing your stage presence and getting used to being in front of a crowd.

, Some people have actually managed to become famous through posting videos of themselves singing on YouTube. (See Charice Pempengco, Austin Mahone, Greyson Chance and, most importantly, Justin Bieber.)


Remember: the Internet isn't always a kind place. If you're not sure your voice is great, it might be wise to hold off until you have some more training. You might get accolades online, but you also might encounter people who are out to tear you down.
Additionally, it's wise to keep in mind that the things you post online will, in a way, live forever. Only post work you'd be proud to have anyone see, and that you think you'll still be proud of in 10 years.

Do not post on YouTube if you're underage. If you're a minor, ask one of your parents to help you post content.

, Eat, breathe, and sleep attention. Look for photo ops. Speak up. Swipe up any chance to shake up the spotlight. Make yourself known.

, Be in the places where successful musicians/producers meet (clubs, dance halls) and act like you're part of the industry, even if they don't know who you are. Go to a city known for music (such as Nashville, Memphis, NYC, LA, New Orleans, Austin or Las Vegas) and mix it up with the local musicians.


Make connections with other musicians. You never know who might want to collaborate with you in the future, or introduce you to an agent. Take the time to be friendly and interested in the other person's career.

, When you're on-stage or networking with industry professionals, turn on the charm. Smile big, answer questions, and sing with enthusiasm, even if you're feeling terrible. Part of working in entertainment is being able to create an atmosphere of fun and energy, as if you're flipping a light switch.


Don't pull any diva antics on people who become your fans. Remember that fans can propel you from obscurity to fame. Sign autographs, answer questions, and take pictures after the show.

, Hey, it happens - no matter how great you are, some people just won't like your voice. Even world-famous singers have people who dislike them. Only listen to constructive criticism if it can actually help you improve your talent; otherwise, ignore it. Don't get into arguments or fights regarding your dreams, and walk away from any hecklers - odds are, they're just jealous.

, It's not common knowledge, but a lot of great musical acts were turned down several times before signing to a label, including the Beatles. If someone doesn't want to work with you, it's his or her loss - move on to the next opportunity and keep your chin up.

, Once word gets out that you're interested in pursuing a musical career, you might find yourself being targeted by scammers with bad contracts. Keep these things in mind:


If an agent or a label wants to sign you, it shouldn't cost you any money - you're being signed because the agent thinks you can make money for him or her, as well as for yourself. Don't consent to any contracts that require you to pay for demos, vocal training, or anything else. Remember: a good agent gets paid when you're successful, not before you've even done anything.
If you do get offered a contract, read it carefully. It might be worth it to pay a lawyer to go over it with you. It might cost you a few hundred dollars up-front, but it could save you thousands in the long run.
Never settle for a verbal agreement. Always demand a written contract where money or rights are concerned.

, If you don't play an instrument, it might be wise to join a band that can provide instrumentation for you. Be aware, though, that once you're part of a band, you're honor-bound to share some level of your success - you can't pursue a career as selfishly as you would if you were a solo act. Weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.

, Whether you keep taking vocal lessons or practice on your own, never stop trying to get better at singing. Practice as often as you can, and challenge yourself with new material. Doing this will help you feel confident that when you do get noticed, you'll be at your best.

My downloader isn't picking up downloads from Headphones.,
I'm getting a Database is locked message.",How to Install Headphones," Headphones is a tool that allows you to automatically download the latest albums and songs from your favorite artists as soon as they become available. This allows you to fill out your music library without any interaction on your part; new songs from your favorite or wish listed artists will just show up.


It is illegal in most areas to download music that you do not own.
Headphones is not a downloader, it simply automatically searches for and sends new downloads to your Usenet reader or Torrent client. That program will then handle the actual downloading process.

, Headphones can download from two different sources: Usenet or torrents. Usenet requires a monthly fee, but is very fast and secure. Torrents don't require a fee, but it is highly recommended that you connect through a VPN subscription service to avoid receiving threatening legal letters or legal action.



Click here if you plan on using Usenet with Headphones. This is the recommended way to use Headphones.

Click here if you want to use torrent files with Headphones.

, Download SABnzbd for free from sabnzbd.org/. This is a free, open-source newsgroup downloader that will pull files from Usenet posts and download them to your computer. It is designed to be highly automated, so that once it's configured you won't need to interact with it again. SABnzbd will download NZB files, which are the Usenet equivalents of torrents.


When properly configured, Headphones will search for new tracks and then push the downloads to SABnzbd. SABnzbd will then download the NZB files to your system and extract the contents.
If you'd prefer to use a torrent client instead of a Usenet client, click here.;
, The installation process varies depending on your operating system:



Windows - Run the installer file that you downloaded. During the installation process, indicate whether or not you want SABnzbd to start when Windows starts (this is recommended if you want the process to be fully automated). Also indicate that you want to associate NZB file with SABnzbd.

Mac - Double-click the DMG file that you downloaded. Drag SABnzbd from the window that appears into your Applications folder. Double-click it in the Applications folder to start it. To add it to your system startup process, open the ""System Preferences"" menu, select ""Accounts"", select your account, and then drag SABnzbd into the ""Login Items"" field.

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) - Open the Terminal and type sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jcfp/ppa. Then type sudo apt-get update to load the new repository into your list of available packages. Type sudo apt-get install sabnzbdplus to install SABnzbd, and then type sabnzbdplus to start it.

, When starting SABnzbd for the first time after installation, it may take a little while for the browser to appear. SABnzbd is run through your default web browser, and all configuration is done through the web-style interface.

, After launching for the first time, yo will be prompted to select your preferred language and theme. Select whichever theme you'd like.

, You can select if you want SABnzbd accessible by other computers on the network, or just the computer it was installed on. You can also set a password, which is recommended if you plan on remotely accessing the service.

, You will need to enter the Usenet server address and port of the service you are subscribed to, your username and password, the number of connections your server allows, and you will need to indicate if it supports SSL (encryption).


All of this information will be available on your Usenet service's account page. Click here for instructions on setting up a Usenet account.
Click Test Server to check that the information you entered is correct.

, These services are no longer active.

, This will occur automatically after you finish the configuration wizard. Bookmark the webpage that opens after a moment, as this will be your SABnzbd configuration page.

, You can make adjustments here if you'd like downloaded files to be stored somewhere other than the default locations.

, Copy and paste this key into a text document for now so that you have easy access to it later, you'll need it to configure Headphones.That's it for now with SABnzbd, you can close the browser window and SABnzbd will continue running in the background. Click here to move on to installing and configuring Headphones.

, This is typically caused by an issue with your Usenet credentials. Make sure that you've entered in the correct provider, authentication information, and retention amount. Also ensure that you have SSL enabled if your provider supports it.

, SABnzbd does not get along well with firewalls, and this is usually what's causing connection problems.


Add SABnzbd to your firewall's exceptions list, or ""whitelist"". Click here for instructions.
If you are using Windows 7, download and install this Microsoft optional update.
Some antivirus programs will interfere with SABnzbd. Try disabling your antivirus to see if the problem is fixed. If it is, you'll need to add an exception for SABnzbd or try a different antivirus program.

, Occasionally SABnzbd won't be able to repair a file after downloading it. This can cause the process to freeze, holding up the rest of your download queue. You'll need to manually kill the repair process so that SABnzbd can continue downloading.


Open your operating system's process manager.

Find and kill the ""par2"" process. This is SABnzbd's repair process.
Manually extract the file. Since the repair process has failed, SABnzbd will mark it as ""Failed"" and move on. You will need to manually extract the file using WinRAR or 7-Zip.

, This is one of the lightest and fastest torrent clients available, but these steps should work essentially the same regardless of the client you are using. For the sake of simplicity, this guide will only reference uTorrent.



Click here for instructions on installing uTorrent.

, Since you'll want the process to be as automated as possible, you'll want to take a few moments to ensure that uTorrent's settings are set to maximize speed and eliminate the need for you to interfere.



Click here for a guide on configuring uTorrent effectively.

, Headphones will automatically add torrents for uTorrent to then download, so there are a few settings you'll need to adjust in order to make this process seamless. First, open the Preferences window from the ""Options"" menu.Select the ""General"" tab and check ""Start uTorrent when Windows Starts"". THis will ensure that uTorrent is open and ready to immediately begin downloading anything Headphones finds.
Click the ""Directories"" tab and check the ""Automatically load .torrents from:"" box, and then specify a folder on your computer that will store new torrents loaded from Headphones. This folder will be referred to by Headphones as your ""Black Hole"" folder, so make a note of it. Any torrent added to this folder will automatically begin downloading in uTorrent.
While still in the directories tab, you can set your completed download to be moved to specific folders.

, That's it for your torrent client configuration, and now you're ready to install Headphones. Make sure that your torrent client is connecting through a VPN for added security.

, You will need the Python if you are using Headphones in Windows. OS X and Linux come with Python pre-installed.


You can download Python for free at python.org/downloads/windows/. Download Python 2.7.9; Python 3 is not compatible with Headphones.

, The download process varies depending on your operating system:



Windows - Visit github.com/rembo10/headphones/zipball/master to download the ZIP file containing Headphones. Double-click the ZIP file to open it. Drag the folder inside onto your C: drive. This is where Headphones will be installed to. You can rename the folder to ""Headphones"" if you want. Double-click Headphones.py to start Headphones in your web browser.

Mac - Open the Terminal (found in the Utilities folder) and type xcode-select --install to install Git. Type mkdir /Applications/Headphones to create the installation folder, and then type cd /Applications/Headphones to open it. Finally, type git clone https://github.com/rembo10/headphones.git Headphones to install Headphones. Using this method ensures that you always have the latest version. Type python Headphones.py to start Headphones in your web browser.

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) - Open your Terminal and type sudo apt-get install git-core to install Git. Type cd /opt and then git clone https://github.com/rembo10/headphones.git to download Headphones. Type cd headphones and then python Headphones.py to start Headphones in your web browser.

, This requires a little extra work, but is recommended if you want a truly automated system.



Windows - Right-click on Headphones.py and select ""Create shortcut"". Press ⊞ Win+R to open the Run box and type shell:startup to open your Startup folder. Drag your newly-created shortcut into this folder.

Mac - Open Automator, which can be found in your Applications folder. Select ""Application"" as the document type. Enable the Library using the button in the upper-left corner of the window. Select ""Utilities"" from the Library, and then ""Run Apple"". Paste the following code into the right frame, replacing adminpassword with the Mac's administrator password: do shell script ""python /Applications/Headphones/Headphones.py"" password ""adminpassword"" with administrator privileges. Click ""Run"" to test it, and Headphones should open. Close Automator and save the new document as ""Headphones"". Ensure that ""Where"" is set to ""Applications"", and that ""File Format"" is ""Application"". Open ""System Preferences"", select ""Accounts"", select your account, and then drag the new Headphones Automator file into the ""Login Items"" field.

, After launching Headphones, you'll be greeted with a web interface. Click the Gear button in the upper-right corner to open the Settings page. Make sure to click the ""Save Changes"" button at the bottom of each tab when you're finished making changes.

, This will let you configure Headphone's connection to either SABnzbd (Usenet) or your torrent client.


Usenet - Select the ""SABnzbd"" option at the top of the Usenet section. Enter your SABnzbd information, including the API that you copied to a text document earlier. The ""SABnzbd Host"" field should read ""0.0.0.0:8080"" unless you made changes during SABnzbd configuration. For the ""SABnzbd Category"", enter ""music"". Enter your Usenet provider's Retention into the last field.
Torrents - Select ""Black Hole"" option at the top of the Torrents section. Enter your Black Hole directory (the directory that uTorrent is loading torrents from). Select your minimum seeder option (10 is usually a good number), and decide if you want to continue seeding files after the download has been completed.

, This is where you will set the search engines that Headphones will use to find new content for you.


NZBs (Usenet) - Select the search protocols you want to use. Newznab is the most popular, as some of the others have been closed down. You can also use the Headphones Indexer. After selecting Newznab, you'll need to enter your provider's web address and API Key. Note that not all search providers are free. You can find the API key on your search provider's site in the API/RSS section.
Torrents - Select the torrent trackers you want to add. When selecting one, make sure that the tracker still works, as they tend to get shut down and switch domains often.

, The settings on this tab determine the quality of files that Headphones searches for, as well as what it does with the files once they've been downloaded. A lot of the settings here are going to be up to your personal preferences.


The ""Quality"" side lets you dictate whether Headphones should look for lossless files or not. Lossless files are larger but don't suffer from any audio compression. You can also specify a preferred bitrate.
The Post-Processing side allows you to automatically sort and rename completed files, download album art, fix metadata information for the songs, and delete extra files like playlists.

, Once you've adjusted your settings, you can import your library into Headphones. This will allow Headphones to find new music by artists in your collection.


Click the ""Manage"" tab on the main Headphones screen.
Select the ""Scan Music Library"" option.
Check the ""Automatically scan library"" and ""auto-add new artists"" box.
Click ""Save changes and scan"", and Headphones will begin scanning your computer for existing music tracks.

, After scanning your library, albums will be added to the ""Wanted"" tab based on what is currently on your computer. You can uncheck albums that you don't want to download, or mark them as already downloaded if you got them from another source.

, Now that Headphones and your download service are configured, all you have to do is wait for your library to fill. Any time that new content from the artists in your library becomes available through your search sources, Headphones will automatically find it and set it to download., This is typically caused by problems with your search provider settings.


Make sure that you've entered the server information correctly in the ""Search providers"" tab of Settings.
Ensure that you have provided the correct credentials to use that search provider.
This error is sometimes not actually an error, and is simply an indicator that no results were found for the search. This is most common with KickAssTorrents.

, This is usually cause by authentication issues, or a problem with your Black Hole directory.


Ensure that all of your APIs have been entered correctly, both in Headphones and SABnzbd.
Ensure that the Black Hole directory in Headphones matches the Watch directory in your torrent client.
Ensure that your downloader is checking for new downloads regularly.

, The most common cause for this error is a large library that is getting scanned too often. When your database is being scanned, it locks the database, which isn't a problem for smaller or medium-sized libraries. If you have tons of tracks however, the scan could be taking too long and causing other functions to lock.Open the ""Manage"" tab from the Headphones main page.
Increase the scanning interval until you no longer receive the error message.

Find the right app or program for you.,
Use a music-recognition app.,
Record yourself humming the melody.Find somewhere peaceful and quiet.,
Include any additional details you can think of.,
Post up your query.How you go about posting will vary depending on the site.,
Wait for an answer.",How to Identify Songs Using Melody1," There is a world of app, programs, sites and web communities specifically devoted to music identification. As it turns out, you're in great company if you are looking to identify a song.


Online music finders like Midomi and WatZatSong are great places to meet people with experience and interest in identifying music. Virtual piano keyboards are available to identify melodies on several sites online, most notably Folk Tune Finder and Musipedia.If you have formal music training, inputting the notes via notation (C, C#, D etc.) is also an option on sites like JC ABC Tune Finder and Themefinder. ;
, If you're somewhere the mystery song is being played somewhere around you, you can use the Shazam app to identify it for you.Download the app, and aim your phone towards the music for several seconds. In the majority of cases, the app will be able to tell you exactly which song and artist are playing at the moment.


Soundhound is another great music-recognition app. With it, you can get the song you're looking for by briefly humming into a mic. It's far from perfect, but could be a quick fix if you've got a melody on your mind.Most times a music-recognition app fails, it's because there is too much background noise for the app to get a clear reading of the music. If that happens, wait until it becomes more quiet, or find another area where you're get a more direct feed of the music.

, Once you're settled, record yourself humming or singing the melody. You won't need anything more than a basic webcam mic to suit your recording purposes. Take care to sing it as clearly and as accurately as possible, as this will be all the database or online community has to help you with.


If you've chosen to input the melody via a virtual keyboard, take care to make sure the rhythm and notes are as accurate as you can make them.

, If the program or site you're using offers a text box, you should use it to fill in as much information as you know about the song.The most help details should include the probable genre of the music, and the setting you first heard it. While this doesn't apply to automated databases, it could mean the different between a community member pinpointing it or not for you.

, Most will require you to start an account; this shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to wade through. From there, it should be a straightforward process of putting up your post and waiting for the answers to start rolling in.

, The communities on sites like Midomi are passionate and helpful, and should be quick to help you out with your query. If you get different answers as to what song it is, it's recommended you check all of them. When you're finally hearing the song you've been looking for, it should click in immediately. There's a great feeling of relief and satisfaction in identifying a song you were looking for, so bask in the glory!


YouTube is an extensive and ubiquitous way of hearing music. No matter how obscure or recent, there should be a streaming video with the song you're looking to hear.

Gather two large, heavy objects.,
Place the warped record between the objects.,
Prepare to wait for a few days.",How to Fix a Warped Vinyl Record1," These objects need to be wide enough to cover the entirety of the record. They need to be heavy enough to put pressure on the record without warping it further. Two large books are best for this purpose.;
, Put the first object on a flat surface, such as a table. Put the record atop the object, followed by your second heavy object. Make sure the objects cover as much of the record as possible; if any part sticks out, they may be warped.


Before you place the record between the two objects, ensure it is clean. The last thing you want is a grain of sand grinding a scratch into your record., This is perhaps the longest method you’ll use. You’re relying on constant, gradual pressure to un-warp your record, and this will take some time. Prepare to wait for days, maybe even weeks for the record to un-warp."
"
Try to think how much you remember of the song.If you are trying to remember a song you forgot as opposed to identifying a song from scratch, you may be able to remember it yourself.,
Meditate.,
Visit the place you last heard the song.,
Hum the melody repeatedly.,
Do something else and let it come to you.",How to Identify Songs Using Melody2," If you have the song's melody in mind, try to recall if you remember anything else alongside it. Was there a catchy lyric or rhythm that caught your ear as well? Although melody is the easiest part of music to remember, you'll have your best chance identifying the song the more details you recollect.


Remembering a lyric is the most helpful when it comes to song identification, as three or four words from a lyric in sequence can yield a successful Google search.
Sadly, success with remembering isn't the sort of thing that can be forced, and success cannot be promised, only made more likely.

, On top of its other mental health benefits, meditating can be a great idea to recall memories. Find somewhere quiet and tranquil to unwind, and let your thoughts go blank. Focus on your breathing, and keep your respiration slow and controlled. Let yourself meditate for 10-15 minutes. Allow yourself to drift away from trying to remember the song; if the song ends up popping into your head, it will do so on its own accord and cannot be forced.Meditating with the pure intent of memory recall may defeat the purpose, as your brain will still be under the strain of trying to remember.

, Quite often, going to the last place you heard the song in question will help bring other details to light. Return to the place, preferably at the same time of day you heard the song, and picture yourself listening to the melody.


This step need not apply solely to physical spaces. If you heard the song on a particular radio station for example, you might find it helpful to return to that station and listen to the broadcast. Popular music stations are prone to repeating songs frequently anyway. You might end up hearing the song you were looking for if you tune in for long enough.

, If you have a clear grasp of the song's melody, humming it out loud will allow you to focus on it. By making it tangible to your ears, your brain may fill in the gaps of what it remembers being there, and you'll have an easier time bringing the memories you're looking for to the forefront of your consciousness.Better still, you might consider recording yourself humming the melody. That way, you can listen to it purely as an active listener., Forcing yourself to remember something can be very frustrating. If you're wanting to remember a song on your own, sometimes the best way to go about it is letting your brain go elsewhere. Occupy yourself with something different and go about your regular daily routine. It's obviously not something you can depend on for results, but it's not unheard of that the song (as well as its title) will rush into your head once you're invested in something else.

"
"
Consider what you know of the song.,
Find a friend who might know the song.Choosing the right person to help you has a lot to do with what you currently remember of the song itself.,
Play or sing the melody.Find somewhere non-distracting and relatively quiet; that way, there won't be uncontrolled factors hindering the process.,
Describe the other parts of the music you remember.Giving your helper some context as to the tone, rhythm and general style of the song can help them pinpoint a song just as well as any melody.,
Brainstorm.Now that you've given them the melody, you and your friend can brainstorm as to what it's about.,
Ask others.",How to Identify Songs Using Melody3," If you're trying to identify a song simply using a melody, it is first important to consider how much of that melody you actually remember. Every little bit of information helps, and will increase the likelihood that a friend will be able to pinpoint the song for you.


Being a more attentive listener throughout your music-listening habits will make future scenarios like this much easier to grapple with.Take care to make sure that all of the information you think you remember is actually right. The memory can be a strange thing, and a few botched notes in your melody can lead your helper completely astray.

, If you distinctly remember the song's melody chances are you'll know the genre as well. Many people prefer certain genres over others, and the ones that tend to listen to the genre of the song in question will subsequently have the highest chance of successfully helping you out.


Enlisting the help of friends with formal musical training is helpful too, as they are used to identifying music purely on the basis of melody.

, Sit down with your friend and recreate the melody for them, whether with your voice or the piano. Take care to accurately reproduce the cadence and rhythm of the melody as well-- melody entails far more than a simple sequence of notes!


While you can technically recreate the melody on just about any musical instrument, it's actually recommended you try doing it with your voice. Especially if you're not a trained musician yourself, the human voice offers a lot of potential for expression. In singing the melody, you might be able to get some of the timbre and tone across as well, making your approximation that much more specific.

, Part of what you're doing is trying to give them an accurate impression inside their head as to the song. That way, they'll have an easier time to pinpointing it.


Many melodies can be used by multiple songs, so providing a little bit of context can go a long way towards helping identifying the song in question.

, Encourage them to ask you questions about the song. It is possible you still remember more than the information you've offered them. Give another hum to the melody once the two of you have discussed it a little bit, and see if either of you approach it any differently.


While you're talking and humming the melody, you should remain open to the possibility that you'll remember the song yourself, provided it's something you've forgotten as opposed to trying to identify it from scratch.

, If the first person you ask isn't successful, you should try getting help from other people. In the case of identifying a melody, in most cases it's a simple matter of having it click instantly. What ends up leading to the brainstorming stage for some people may be an instant bid for others. Don't lose hope if you can't get it right the first time; find someone new, and begin the process again.

Place the record between two sheets of glass.,
Preheat the oven to about 175 °F (79 °C) and place the record inside.Depending on your oven, preheating should take between 10-15 minutes.,
Let the record sit in the oven for no longer than 3 minutes.,

Place a heavy object in the center of the glass pane, over the record.,
Inspect the record carefully.",How to Fix a Warped Vinyl Record2," Center the record atop the first pane of glass. Take the second sheet and place it on top of the record, essentially sandwiching the record between the glass panes.


It’ll be easier to pick up the glass sheets afterwards if you leave one of their corners hanging off of the table as you set it up.

, Once the oven has reached the right temperature, carefully slide the record and glass combination onto the oven rack. Don’t push the glass too far into the oven; this will make it easier to retrieve later.


Make sure the glass is at room temperature before putting it in the oven, otherwise it might shatter.Use oven mitts to avoid possible burns.

, Any longer than this and the record could melt. Keep a close eye on the record as it warms. If you notice any strange smells or noises, remove the record quickly.

, Use oven mitts as the glass will be hot to the touch. Place the glass panes on a flat surface, such as a table or countertop.


To avoid damage to your surface, you may want to place a potholder, towel or cutting board between it and the glass.

, This constant pressure, combined with the heat, is what will help repair the record. Leave the object on the glass pane until it cools. Once the glass has cooled, you can remove the record.

, If the record still shows significant warping, try repeating the above steps until it has been fixed. Otherwise, try placing it in a record player to see if you’ve been able to repair the damage.

Store your records away from direct sunlight.,
Avoid stacking your records.,
Keep your records away from humidity.",How to Fix a Warped Vinyl Record3," Leaving them in sunlight or heat can cause warping. Keep the records away from windows and heating. You’ll also want to make sure you don’t leave your records in a vehicle on a hot day., Vinyl records are relatively heavy, and stacking them atop each other puts significant pressure on the records at the bottom of the pile. This can cause them to get warped, scratched and scuffed.Make sure you store your records vertically to avoid this pressure.

, While most people typically store their records in a basement, the typical humidity in these spaces will likely warp the records. Try to find a space you can use that isn’t overly humid. If a basement is your only choice, you should consider installing a dehumidifier to provide a safe place to store your records.

Create an account.,
Visit the Bandcamp home page.,
Follow your favorite artists.,
Discover new music on your newsfeed.,
Create a collection of music.",How to Find New Music4," Band camp is a great way to discover new artists and music that aren't always at the top of the charts. In order to create an account you'll need to first buy music or support an artist. The great thing about band camp is that many of the artists give away their music for free, so you can search for a free album or song and then you'll be able to create an account.


Josh Garrels often gives away his music for free with no minimum purchase amount (a donation is recommended) and there are other artists like this on Bandcamp that allow you to download their album without paying anything., This is the page where you will find a lot of the trending artists, new albums, and fan spotlight (recent favorites from artists, fans, and special guests). On the home page you should also see a ""Discover"" section which lists albums from different genres.In the discover section, you can choose the genre, the date (today, this week, last week, 2 weeks ago, ect.) and then decide between best-selling, staff picks, new arrivals, and artist recommended. By clicking on an album, Bandcamp will automatically start playing one of the songs from the album, and then you have the option to listen to more of the album by clicking on the ""Hear More"" link below the song that is being played. You can also choose to ""Buy Now"" or put the song on your wishlist, which will require an account.

, Whenever artists you like put out new music, you can automatically be notified by Bandcamp by following the artist on their home page.

, With Bandcamp you can follow your favorite artists, but you can also follow other fans too. On your newsfeed you should see the activity of your followed fans and artists. You can listen to any music they have listened to, and you can also find ""recommended fans"" (people who have a shared taste in music with you that Bandcamp suggests you could follow).The difference between Bandcamp and something like iTunes is you have unlimited access to music, meaning you can listen to the full length of a song before you buy it. Bandcamp also features alternative, indie, rock, and folk music as their primary music so you're likely going to get a different variety of music selection than you would through a popular music streaming app.

, This can be done after you have created an account by adding music to your wishlist and purchasing music from artists. You then have access to your collection through the Bandcamp app or their website. You can also re-download purchases, which allows you to recover music that you may have lost.To re-download purchases you can visit your music collection and click ""Download"" below the album or track you want to listen to.

Find music festivals and shows.,
Take note of random songs you like.,
Go to your local music store.",How to Find Good Music of the Genre You Like1," There are many music festivals that are specific to one genre, such as the Chicago Blues Festival and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco. Going out to music festivals will not only expose you to up and coming bands, but will also put you in contact with others who enjoy listening to the same type of music and you may find end up getting even more recommendations from them.


Music shows and festivals have the added benefit of experiencing the music in a new way, which can make you appreciate not only the new music, but the genre in a different setting.;
, Though we all have specific genres and artists we really like, sometimes we will randomly hear a song that we really enjoy. Do your best to find out what the song is and if it’s an artist you’ve never heard of before, then you’ve already expanded your inner music library a bit!


For example, if you hear a song you like in a bar or restaurant, ask an employee if they know what it is.
You can also use music apps, such as Shazam, if you have a smart phone. Such apps will pick up on the sounds around you and can be surprisingly effective in identifying the song title and artist if no one around you recognizes it.

, Record stores in particular are a great place to find new music in the genres you like as the music is divided into different sections. Employees also tend to be knowledgeable about music so feel free to ask them for recommendations.


If you don’t know of any music stores in your area, trying looking up “music” or “record stores” on Google maps.
You should start by browsing the different sections of the store that carry the genres of music you like. However, if you want to find music that is similar to specific artists, you’re better off asking the employees directly.
Try not to be too specific. If you really, really like an artist, you probably will not be able to find another artist which sounds exactly the same, so don’t get frustrated if the employees give you recommendations that take you out of your comfort zone. After all, it would be boring to listen to music that all sounded exactly the same, so listen to their suggestions with an open mind.

Check out music databases.,
Use digital music aggregators.,
Read music journalism.",How to Find Good Music of the Genre You Like2," There’s a wealth of information about music that will help you not only learn more about what you like and listen to, but will provide you with many new suggestions to listen to.


Try a site like AllMusic, which is essentially an online encyclopedia of music and even has options to stream music so you can listen as you browse.

To navigate this site, search for an artist you like and check out the “Related” tab near the top of the artist page. This page lists 1) artists which influenced your artist, 2) artists which are similar to your artist, and 3) artists which were influenced by your artists.



, These are web-based technologies that collect music from all sources and consolidate it in one place.They can come in the form of apps or websites and are extremely useful for finding new music that is similar to what you like.


For example, the website If You Digallows you to simply type in an artist you like and it will suggest related artists. Other options abound, including Gnodwhich describes itself as a “search engine for music you don’t know about” and Spotify, a commercial music service, that has a range of options, including radios and lists of similar artists, to help you find music you will enjoy.If you are outside of the United States, the collection of music you can access may be limited due to copyright restrictions. Luckily, there are still other music aggregators that are not geo-restricted and you can access these from anywhere around the world. Check out Earbits Radio, Musicovery, or Shuffler.fm., Turning to the critics, such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork, can help you find new music. Music journalists are taste-makers for a good reason. They tend to have an in-depth knowledge of music, including specific bands’ influences and peers.

Ask people for recommendations.,
Take a class.,
Go to the library.,
Use other forms of media.,
Listen to the radio.",How to Find Good Music of the Genre You Like3," Though many of us turn to the Internet for nearly all of our research, real world recommendations can be just as rewarding. We all have at least one or two people in our lives who have similar music tastes to us and so you should always look to these people as a resource.


If you know any music experts, be sure to seek their guidance. If they are knowledgeable about the area of music you are interested in, tell them who your favorites are and write down any suggestions they have. They will likely be able to steer you in the right direction based on your current tastes.
Ask your friends what they listen to. In all likelihood, your friends will have similar taste in music to yours, and the recommendations they give will be helpful.

, If you are serious about rock n roll or jazz, you may want to take your music appreciation to the next level by taking a class. You can enroll in online classes or community college classes. This may be a good option if there is one genre you are a die-hard fan of as you are sure to not only find new music, but come away from the experience with a deepened knowledge of and appreciation for that particular style of music.

, Libraries are still an incredibly useful resource for finding new music, especially if your access to the Internet is limited. Public libraries tend to have CDs and sometimes other music formats as well.


Libraries can also be a resource if you are interested in doing more in depth research about music. You could ask as a librarian for books about the musical styles you like and read up on the history and influences of your favorite artists.

, Exploring other art forms, such as reading books and watching documentaries about the artists and music genres you like can be a great way to learn more about the music influences and related or significant artists.


When doing this, it is helpful to keep a notebook handy to jot down notes and look up the artists to listen to their songs later.

, Many stations just play the most current songs or the Top 40, but there are also stations which play older songs in a variety of genres.


Use a search engine to find stations in your area and their genre(s) of choice, or just dial around. Many stations keep records of what they played on their websites, and some even allow you to text or call in with questions about the artists they have played.

Listen to the song while reading the lyrics.,
Read the lyrics on their own to decipher their meaning.,
Focus on concrete imagery and senses.,
Unpack unusual or poetic phrases one at a time.,
Check a lyric annotation site for additional clues.,
Remember that there is rarely one ""right"" meaning.",How to Figure Out a Song's Meaning1," Pull the lyrics up online to make sure you're not mishearing any of them. For now, just focus on your first impressions. What do you think the song is about? What parts confuse you, and what parts seem perfectly clear? There are no wrong answers, as your first impressions help decide the feel and theme of the song.


What is the overall mood of the song?
How do the lyrics match up with the instruments? Do they have a similar feel or are they conflicting with each other?;
, Great lyrics are a form of poetry, and reading them without the distraction of instruments can help you parse out their intent. When reading the question, ask yourself the same questions you might ask about a poem:


Who is the speaker? Don't just assume that the speaker is literally the singer -- they could be playing a character or referencing a larger issue.
If there is a ""you"" or a ""we"" in the song, who does this refer to? A lover? A friend? A politician?
What are the major images or ideas that keep popping up.

, Good lyrics have a ""visual"" component as well. They describe a scene or feeling with images, not just vague ideas or phrases. If you were making a movie of the song, what are the images that keep cropping up? By visualizing the song as a scene, do any of the most confusing lines start to make sense?


Where does the song take place? This could be a very specific location, like Kent State in Neil Young's ""Ohio,"" or something vaguer, like a girl's bedroom in Tailor Swift's ""Love Story.""
""New Slang"" by The Shins starts with the line ""Gold teeth and a curse for this town were all in my mouth // only I don't know how they got out, dear."" This may seem confusing, but later lyrics show that he was being rude at a bar. He got punched in the face for saying his ""curse.""

, Metaphors and figurative language are when the words don't literally mean what they say. When Bob Dylan suggests that ""the answers, my friend, are blowing in the wind,"" he doesn't actually mean the answers are flying in a breeze. He means that the answers are simple and all around us if we just take the time to stop and look. When faced with unusual sections, ask yourself if they may stand for something other than what they appear.


Look for comparisons and commonality. Most metaphors aren't perfect, they simply draw a simple line between two things. ""My love is a rose"" doesn't necessarily mean a woman is red, slender, etc. It likely means she is beautiful but also dangerously thorny.
Search online for images or ideas you don't understand. They may come from movies, other songs, old myths, etc.

, Sites like Genius.com allow anyone to annotate lyrics with interpretations, explanations, and definitions of each line. Even better, the actual lyricists often write their own notes on the site, which are labeled and verified to help you understand more oblique lyrics.


Try out SongMeanings, SongFacts, and LyricInterpretations, as well.
Note, however, that you don't have to agree with every annotation put up by other people. These sites are great places to start breaking down complex sections, however., The Eagle's ""Hotel California"" is one of the most debated songs of all time, because so many people have so many interpretations of it. Some think it references the music industry, which traps you with promises of wealth. Others think the hotel is a gateway to Hell, trapping wayward sinners. A few believe it is just a fictional story of a dangerous place. None of them are totally wrong and none are totally right.


What is most important is that you can defend your position with evidence from the song. As long as you can back up your meaning with actual lyrics or stories, it is a valid meaning.
Most artists will even admit that they don't know the song's full meaning. Writing lyrics can be subconsciousness, and the meaning people get from listening to a song is just as important as the meaning when writing it."
"
Listen to the album the song came from for clues to larger themes.,
Read into the song's historical context.,
Consider how the tone of the instruments matches the song's lyrics.,
Note how the song changes from beginning to end.,
Watch the song's music video, but be careful of added confusion.,
Know that many songs don't have complex meanings.",How to Figure Out a Song's Meaning2," While not all songs are part of a larger message, many songs make more sense in the context of the whole album. Are there other songs that hint at a similar meanings or themes? Are there characters, images, or ideas that keep cropping up in other songs?


What songs come before or after the song you're listening to? Do the shifts in mood or tone between songs tell you anything?
The first song and last song generally set the theme. If the song came first, what kind of mood does it set for all the songs after it? If it comes last, what kind of tone does it leave the listener on?

, Charles Mingus's famous jazz song ""Fables of Faubus"" means very little if you don't know that Governor Faubus tried to prevent desegregation in Arkansas. The famous Fleetwood Mac album Rumors makes much more sense once you realize that, at the time, everyone gossiped that the band members were secretly dating. Many songs only make sense in the year they were released, as they explicitly address current events.


Look up the year the song was released or written, as well as any major current events from that period. Does anything seem familiar?
Sometimes artists will talk about personal issues that influenced songs years after they were released. For example, Kanye West's second album, Late Registration, talks a lot about fame and money, whereas his first album talks about the struggles of a starving artist.

, How do the instrumentals make you feel -- dark and moody, happy and bouncy, slow and contemplative, high-energy and rocking? Sometimes there will be a disconnect between lyrics and music, which points to more meaning. For example, if there are melancholy lyrics but a happy backing track, you can often assume that the lyrics are supposed to be funny. They could also show an interesting contrast -- the world around the singer might be happy, but the singer is not.


Third Eye Blind's famous ""Semi-Charmed Life"" is about a crushing meth addiction. The happy background music symbolizes the quick but high-tempo high the characters get, even as they are ruining their lives.

, A clue to many songs' meanings comes from their progression. If you think about the song as a speech from a friend, what was the point of the speech? How did their mood or perspective change from the first line to the last? If you have noticed a change in the song, go back and find the line or lines where it occurred.


A sudden twist or change is often called a ""turn."" For example, if the singer is pining over a girl in the beginning but seems happy at the end, what was the line where the singer's luck ""turned?"" This is often your biggest clue to a song's meaning.

, Music videos can sometimes help show a song's meaning, but they can also make it far more confusing. That's because many music video directors are telling short stories that may or may not line up literally with the lyrics. Instead, they tend to match the mood or tone of the song without directly portraying what the song means.


What is the theme of the music video? This often will match the song's theme, even if the stories are different. For example, a video may show two people fighting, smashing their own house, while the song is about politics or current events. The theme may be that people are hurting themselves from the inside.
Many music videos are purely aesthetic. That means they are meant to look pretty without really exploring the song's meaning.

, Some songs are just songs -- they cover a wide range of ideas or topics, describe a straightforward love, or are simply made to get people dancing. If you've dug into the song's lyrics, looked up its background, and understand the references, but still don't see an overall meaning or point, there probably isn't one. Just enjoy the song and the deeper understanding you've gained of it and move on.

Even if the bands aren't necessarily related by genre or scene to any degree (other than the fact that they're on ""indie"" labels), listening to a random batch of music is a great way to expand your palette.

, You may put in an artist you like and you can listen to streaming music similar to said artists style. You might just find something you like in the mix!

The term was originally used by Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal, to refer to the kind of tone he was trying to get, but it's now applied by fans (and detractors) of a particular group of bands that use that tone, specifically in main guitar riffs and breakdowns.In the metal community, there's some debate about whether or not ""djent"" is an actual genre or distinct style, or has any staying power as a style.;
, Meshuggah is widely credited as the bad to popularize and coin the djent tone, though it now applies to a variety of progressive meta, pop metal, and metalcore bands who implement djent breakdowns into the songs.If you're curious about the ""djent"" sound, check out the following bands:


Periphery
Animals as Leaders
Tesseract
Monuments
Born of Osiris
Cloudkicker
Bulb

, If you want to hear the riff specifically to get a sense of the sound that Fredrik was originally referring to, there are a variety of ""djent comps"" on YouTube that stream together the heaviest and most ""djenty"" of the djent riffs. It's a good way to do some quick research.

, Again, the existence of djent as a particular genre is somewhat debatable, and it's primarily a trend that peaked in some metalcore bands between 2010 and 2012. Because of this, there aren't a lot of bands that self-identify as ""djent"" bands, but you might be able to hear the influence or the style in their music, since it merely refers to a particular tone and style of riff. You might find djent riffs in:


Deathcore or straight-up death metal
Metalcore, pop metal, or screamo
Prog metal or math rock

, Primarily, the chugging djent riff is played on the lowest string of a guitar with added strings, primarily one down-tuned to D or possibly lower. While it's perfectly fine to play djent riffs of a six-string guitar, having a guitar with multiple strings makes it easier to reserve a particular string to play the breakdown riff without having to sacrifice a particular string to do it.


Generally, djent guitarists will leave the six strings tuned to standard (EADGBE), then down tune the lowest string on the guitar to the key that matches the particular song.

, Contrary to popular belief, the Djent tone is characterized by low gain when compared to other heavy styles. After you plug in your hopefully multi-string guitar, turn the gain up on either a distortion pedal or at your amp to the point where soft playing just barely brakes up and low notes sound almost unaffected.


Depending on the amp you use, you generally want to turn down most if not all other effects, especially effects such as delay, tremolo, or reverb. Djent tone is really crisp and dry, so you want things as as sharp as possible.

, For the purposes of playing breakdowns, it's common to get a little volume boost and punch when you're ready to throw down a djent riff during a breakdown. The best way to do this is with an overdrive pedal. Overdrive plus high gain will equal a crunchy tone for djenting.


Use a compressor effect, as well, to help keep your signal regulated and your notes at the same amplitude. This helps to keep the djent riff at the same level of all the other notes that you're playing in the song, and the individual notes in the riff equalized. Since it's so percussive, this is an essential pedal in your chain.

, While it's not necessary to play a djent riff, the specific tone of the djent riff is interesting and unique, because it goes both high and low at the same time, even though it's on a single note. Partially, this is a virtue of the low tuning and a result of the microtones and harmony of the guitar, but you can emphasize this effect by using a chorus or octave unit in your pedal chain, with the volume turned quite low.


Depending on your rig and guitar, this may be totally unnecessary and kill your tone. If you're happy with your djent-style riffs without either of these pedals, it's safe to leave out of your chain.

, Palm-muting is essential to djent and most metal riffery. Learning to do alternate picking while muting all the strings on the guitar, or at least the strings you're playing, with the edge of your hand helps you to control the sound and make the percussive chug of the djent riff more prominent.


Take your picking hand and rest the space between your pinkie and your wrist on the strings, in between the bridge and neck pick-ups. Do an alternate-picking pattern on the lowest string on your guitar. You're close to djent now.

, Polyrhythms are a common feature of djent, and most progressive or ""math"" metal. What this means, essentially, is that the riff is played at a distinctly different rhythm from the rest of the music, or the beat as its played. This can be played relative to the verses and choruses, or relative to the drums in the riff itself.


If the concept of polyrhythms seems overly complicated, think of it as playing ""off-time"" riffs instead, as if you and the drummer were playing slightly different songs, but at the same tempo, but working together to create one effect.

, Say the word ""djent"" five times, fast. That's what you want your riffs to sound like. Think of like you're using your lowest guitar string like a snare drum to play a rhythmic and melodic ""fill"" that everyone can headbang to. The heavier and the more rhythmic, the better.


Most djent riffs feature no more than one or two notes, so it doesn't need to be overly complicated. Most djent riffs are on the lowest string of the guitar, unfretted.

, One of the cornerstones of mathcore is abrupt transitions between the different sections of the song. Djent riff breakdowns typically slow down the tempo somewhat, relative to the verses and choruses. It's typical to start a djent song with the breakdown riff, then speed up to sing the verse, then shift to the chorus, then back to the


Sweeping arpeggiated solos
Poppy choruses
Frequent djent breakdowns and blast beats
Abrupt tempo transitions

Many metal bands may have anti-social or anti-theist themes.",How to Enjoy Metal," Look for other parts of the song than just the vocals. The complexity and technicality of Heavy Metal songs are like no other. To play in a Metal band, be it any genre, you must be proficient in your chosen instrument...Be it guitar, bass, drums, vocals, etc.;
, Early Metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple are always a good place to start.

, Bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Judas Priest, and Megadeth are great for getting used to the faster, heavier Metal genres.

, I find it's easier to start out with broad ones, then narrow it down. Some of the larger bases are Thrash Metal, Power Metal, and New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM).

,, However, Heavy Metal is also widespread and multi-branched. There are Christian Metal bands, and some of them are good to! If you are religious in a Christian sense, bands like Becoming the Archetype, Crimson Moonlight, and Crimson Thorn will show you that Christian Metal can be just as brutal as secular or anti-religious forms of Metal.

They are the building blocks of musical scales.A scale is a group of notes arranged in ascending order. They span an octave, a set of eight notes (from the Latin word octavus, or “eighth”). For example, the major scale in the key of C Major goes C D E F G A B C. The bottom note of a scale is called the “tonic” note.
If you imagine the above scale as a ladder, each half step is one rung above the previous. Thus, the distance between B and C is a half step because no other “rungs” come between them. (On a piano, the B and C keys are white keys directly next to each other, without black keys in between.) The distance from C to D, however, is a whole step, because there is an extra “rung” between those notes on the ladder (i.e., the black key on the piano, which represents either C-sharp or D-flat).
In the C major scale, the only half steps are between B and C and between E and F. All other intervals are full steps because the C major scale does not include sharp (#) or flat (♭) notes.;
, The major scale always has the same pattern of whole steps (1) and half steps (½): 1 - 1 - ½ - 1 - 1 - 1 - ½. Thus, the C Major scale is C D E F G A B C.You can create any other major scale by changing your beginning note -- called the “tonic note” -- and following the interval pattern.

, Minor scales are more complicated than major scales and can follow any of several patterns. The most common pattern for minor scales is the Natural minor scale.The Natural minor scale has a pattern of steps and half steps that goes like this: 1 - ½ - 1 - 1 - ½ - 1 - 1.
You can transpose this scale pattern (i.e. rewrite it at a different pitch) by starting at a different note and counting up the “rungs” of your scale ladder.

, Thirds and fifths are types of intervals (distances between notes) that are very common in music. They can be useful in determining what key your music is in. Minor intervals have one less half step than major intervals have, which alters their sound.A third is formed by the first note in the key and the third note in the key. A major third has two whole steps between notes, while a minor third has three half steps.
A fifth is formed by the first note in the key and the fifth note in the key. A “perfect” fifth has seven half steps.
If you’ve heard the song “Hallelujah” by Leonard Cohen, you’ve heard about intervals, in this line: “It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift, the baffled king composing ‘Hallelujah’.” In a lot of pop music (often written in the key of C Major), a very prominent chord progression is the movement from the “fourth” to the “fifth,” which creates a “happy”-sounding movement. In the song, the words “minor fall” are accompanied by a minor chord, and the words “major lift” are accompanied by a major chord.

, A basic chord contains three notes, called a triad, arranged in thirds (see Step 4). These chords are usually based on a scale, such as C Major. Major chords have two whole steps between the first and second notes of the triad. A major chord contains a major third and a perfect fifth. The first note of a chord is called the root of the chord.For example, to make a chord based on the C Major scale, you could start at C, the “tonic,” and use it as the “root” of your chord. Then move up to the third of that scale (4 half steps up) to E, then up to the fifth of that scale (3 half steps more up to G). The major chord triad is thus is C - E - G.

, The quality of most chords is determined by the third, or the middle note in the triad. Minor chords have three half steps between the first and second notes of the triad, as opposed to four half steps (or two whole steps) for major chords. A minor chord contains a minor third and a perfect fifth.For example, if you place your fingers up one key from the “root note” of the C Major chord, you will play this chord: D - F - A. This chord is a D minor chord, because the interval between the first and second notes of the chord (D and F) is 3 half steps.

, These chords aren’t as common as major or minor chords, but they are sometimes used to create particular effects. Because of their alteration to familiar triads, they create a melancholic, ominous, or spooky feel in music.A diminished chord contains a minor third and a diminished fifth (a fifth that has been lowered a half step). For example, a diminished C chord would look like this: C - E♭ - G♭.
An augmented chord contains a major third and an augmented fifth (a fifth that has been raised a half step). For example, an augmented C chord would look like this: C - E - G#.

, If you have printed sheet music, you can discover a song’s key by looking at its key signature. This is the set of little markings in between the clef (either treble or bass) and the time signature (the numbers that look like fractions).You will see either # (for sharp notes) or ♭ (for flat notes)
If there are neither # nor ♭listed, the song is either in C major or A minor.

, For key signatures using flats, the key signature is the next-to-last flat (second from the right) marking when read from left to right.


When a song has flats marked at B♭, E♭, and A♭, the E♭ is the next-to-last flat marking, and so the piece of music is in the key of E Flat.
If there is only one flat, the song is either in D minor or F major.

, For key signatures using sharps, the key signature is the note one half-step up from the last sharp marking.


When a song has sharps marked at F# and C#, the next note up from the C# is D, and so the piece of music is the key of D.

, If you play guitar, you will probably refer to chord charts when you learn new music. Many songs begin and end with the chord that matches the key signature. If a piece of music ends with a D chord, it is probably in the key of D.


The three basic chords in the key of C Major are C Major (C - E - G), F Major (F - A - C), and G Major (G - B - D). These three chords make up the basis for many pop songs.

, Knowing a few of the common scales in the type of music you play will help you figure out what key your song is in. The notes in your chord will all be in the scale.


For example, the F Major chord is F - A - C, and all of these notes are in the C Major scale, so the F Major chord is in the key of C.
The A Major chord (A - C# - E) is not in the key of C because the C Major scale does not include sharps.

, Most popular music tends to use one of a few common keys because they are the easiest to play on guitar or piano, which are frequently used as instruments for accompaniment.


C is by far the most common key for pop songs.Look at the music for the following notes that make up the C Major scale: C - D - E - F - G - A - B – C. Do the notes on the music match the notes in the scale? If the answer is yes, then the song is probably in C.

, Remember that music occasionally has accidentals, which are notes marked within the music with a ♭, #, or natural sign, even though the key signature does not indicate that note should always take a ♭, #, or natural sign.


Accidentals do not change the overall key of the piece.

, The tonic, or first note in the scale, will sound right just about anywhere in the song. Using a piano, or your voice, play one note at a time until you find a note that “feels” right with the song. , By playing other notes in the triad you will be able to hear if the chord feels like it fits with the song. Play the fifth note above the note you think is the tonic. The fifth should also sound like it fits in most parts of the song, because it is the second most stable note in a scale.


Play the note one half step below your tonic, known as the seventh. You should feel some tension in the context of the song, as if this note is pulling to be resolved into the tonic.

, Play the note a major third up from the tonic. If this note fits with the song overall, then it is likely that the tune is in a major key. If not, trying playing a minor third (3♭) and listen to see if this fits better.


Practice hearing the difference between a major and a minor triad by playing the following triad: C – E – G is a major triad with C as tonic. Now change the E to E♭. C - E♭- G. Listen to the difference in overall feeling and tone.
You may be able to guess whether it is major or minor simply by the feel of the song, because in a lot of western music songs that are keyed in minor feel sad or pensive.

, The most common chords within a scale should also show up in patterns in the song. One commonly used scale is the G Major scale, which still follows the major scale pattern: G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G. Its chords are G Major, A Minor, B Minor, C Major, D major, E Minor, and F# Diminished.


Songs in the key of G Major will have chords that match these notes.
For example, the Green Day song “(Good Riddance) Time of Your Life” begins with a G Major chord (G - B - D), which is followed by a C Major chord (C - E - G). These chords are both in the G Major scale, so the song is in the key of G Major., Pay attention to songs that are easy to sing along with for you, versus songs that feel uncomfortably high or low. Note the keys of songs that are easy to sing and songs that are hard for you to sing.


Over time you will begin to realize some keys fall easily within your range, while others may be harder for you to reach all the notes. This will help you to make an educated guess about the key before you even begin picking it out on an instrument.

, Make a playlist of some of your favorite songs to sing along to, or use the radio to try to determine the key of the song. You may begin to notice certain patterns. Songs that are in the same key may begin to feel similar to one another to you.


Keep a list of songs you've studied, categorizing them by their key.
Listen to several songs in the same key in a row to practice getting a feel for that key.
Contrast songs in different keys to see if your ear can pick up on the difference.

, Understanding basic music theory is excellent if you want to write your own songs and adapt others’ songs to your own style, but sometimes you just need a quick key check. There are many mobile apps and websites that can help you find the key of a song.Running a search for the name of the song and the key may bring up the answer for you quickly.
When you’re first beginning to learn to find keys by ear it is a good idea to double check that you’re finding the correct answer.

However, there are some easy ways to at least narrow the list down to a few select genres. The easiest thing to do is to scroll through your iTunes library, or other music download library, and look where it says ""genre"" next to each song. Count how many times each appears to see what genre is most prevalent in your music library.Nowadays, genre has grown to include dates in which music came out. For example, 70's rock 'n' roll, or 50's pop. Your music library should also contain the date in which a song is released. See whether the majority of your songs are contained within a specific decade, year, or era.
Write down 2-3 genres you wish to search for. Specific internet sites and/or radios organize random lists of music organized into all types of categories, including genre.;
, Listen to some of your favorite songs. Pay special attention to the instruments used. A song might have a strong bass line (bass guitar), a guitar solo (electric/acoustic guitar), or maybe even a trumpet playing in the background. Whatever it may be, write down some of the instruments you particularly like. You might even want to go through your entire music download library to see what instruments occur the most.After you have your list complete, you can then type in specific instrument names such as ""trombone,"" ""piano,"" etc. into a music site search engine. This will pull up all the possible songs which use that instrument(s) in the song.
You can even focus your search results more by grouping instruments you like together. For example, you can type in ""piano, bass guitar, tuba"" into the search engine. This will bring up songs with those three instruments only.

, You can scroll through your music library and see how many times an artist appears. Write down two or three names and search for them online. If you have all of that artist's major hits, you add words like ""rare"" or ""unreleased"" to your search engine of choice to find songs by them you might not have previously heard.The great thing about focusing your search on a particular artist is that it opens you up to the possibility of finding other artists like them. Take for example that you are obsessed with the group Led Zeppelin. Type into your search engine ""artists like Led Zeppelin"" to find similar types of music.

, These are often topics such as love, commitment, relationships, having fun, depression, sadness, loneliness, happiness, etc. You might wish to listen to love songs like you always do, or you might be having a down day, and wish to listen to a sad song. It is important to pay attention to the tone of certain songs as well. Searching for a song which ""sounds happy"" is different from a song which is lyrically happy.

, You might be looking for music to listen too. For that, you need to focus your searches on music sharing sites, such as Youtube, Spotify, Pandora, etc. If you are instead, looking for sheet music to play, you will need to search other websites and sources. For sheet music, try http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/advanced-search or http://en.scorser.com/D/Sheet+music.html.You can search through sheet music based on lyrics, instruments used, and even notes.

, If you only know a few lines, or even just a few words of a song, you can search for the song online. The most simple way of doing this is to type your lyrics into Google and see what search results pop up. You can also more specialized sites such as http://findmusicbylyrics.com/, http://www.lyricfinder.org/, and/or http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lyrster-lyric-search-engine/. These sites will limit the massive amounts of hits you would get by typing the lyrics into Google.Not only is this good for when you are trying to figure out the name of a song, but also when you are looking for certain types of songs. Take for example you were looking for a love song. Type in keywords into these site search bars such as ""love,"" ""heart,"" ""baby,"" ""romance,"" etc. You would then get lists of songs that have those particular words in the lyrics, and you can sample from that list some songs you might like.
If you know a long refrain in the lyrics, and you wish to type it into one of the search bars, make sure to put parentheses on both ends of the lyrics. This will keep the particular search engine from searching for every word individually, and focus the site on finding the specific combination of words.

, These are apps which you can download onto your mobile device, or computer to help you identify songs you don't now the name of. Shazam and MusicID are apps which are helpful when listening to the radio. Turn on either of the apps, place your device next to the radio as the song is playing, tag the song on the app, and your device will locate what the song title is. These can be downloaded on your Apple or PC app store. Note that Shazam and MusicID only work for prerecorded songs, not live performances.Another app which is helpful is Midomi. This app allows you to hum the song into the microphone on your mobile device. The app will then locate the name of the song for you. This is great for when you have that inevitable song stuck in your head, but you can't think of the name.
Musipedia and/or MelodyCatcher allow you to play a virtual keyboard on your laptop. If you know how to play the keyboard, this is a great app for you. Simply play the song on the keyboard, and the app will track down what song it is.
AudioTag is great if you have a short recording of the unknown song on your laptop or mobile device. Simply download the recording onto the app, and it will identify the song for you.

, This, of course, is the easiest way to find good music. Randomly click on music videos that appear when you search for a song you know on Youtube. In the Apple music store, and other music sharing stores, there is usually a list of songs titled ""You might also enjoy..."" The cookies embedded in your computer tell the store what songs you typically buy, and then the store can give you advice as to some other songs you might enjoy.


You can also turn your iPod or mp3 player to ""Shuffle."" You might have thousands of songs on your mp3 player, and therefore haven't listened to some in ages. This will give you the opportunity to listen to some good music you haven't heard in a while.

, This is a good way to get to know an artist's work, and have fun with your friends. If you don't like the artist's music, you can at least enjoy the time with your friends, and maybe meet new people. Try to go to local concerts put on by local bands where the tickets might be cheaper. You can still get a ""feel"" for a particular type of music, without having to pay a ton of money.


Experiment with different artists. For example, you might already know you love country music, but you might not know if you like Luke Bryan or Blake Shelton.
Experiment with different genres. For example, you might already love rock 'n' roll, but aren't sure whether you like grunge.

, This could be from a friend or a relative. See what types of music, or artists they listen too. They might be the same, or different, but it is always a musical opinion to consider when trying to find good music.


You can also head down to your local music shop, where CD's and records are sold. These are great cultural hubbubs where people who love music gather to talk about, and share their musical passions with others.
The shopkeepers at these stores are also knowledgeable, and will be able to guide you in the right direction.

, Youtube is an internet site which allows users, companies, and artists to upload videos and songs. Type into the search bar an artist's name, lyrics, genre, or a song title. If you know exactly what type of music you are looking for, simply search for it.If you are interested in a particular genre, type the genre name into the search bar. What will pop up is a multitude of ""playlists."" Click on one of these playlists, created by individual users, to listen a bunch of songs within the same genre.
You can also subscribe to a user's account. First you will need to create your own Youtube account by clicking the button (looks like a person) in the upper right hand corner. Subscribe to an account to get more videos of the same nature by clicking the red ""Subscribe"" button below a particular music video. Every time that account uploads a new video, you will get a notification of it on your account.
After you have seen a number of music videos cookies will embed onto your account. Every time you go to Youtube after that, your home screen will show both music videos you have visited, and music videos Youtube thinks you might enjoy. The latter group will give you the opportunity to explore different music that is still within a particular genre, song type, or artist.

, Pandora is a website that is built around the concept of the radio. After you create an account, you can scroll through thousands upon thousands of ""channels,"" each based on a different topic, such as genre, an artist's name, a song topic, etc. Type a word or two into the search bar to find exactly what you are looking for. As you listen to the songs on a particular channel, you can pause the song, or skip to the next song on the channel (allowed 5 skips per hour).Pandora is great to use if you are looking for music within a specific genre. Type the genre (bluegrass, rock 'n' roll, etc.) into the search bar and click on one of the channels. This will give you the opportunity to listen to a new genre you haven't listened to before, or new songs within a particular genre you might have never heard or new existed.
For most songs on Pandora, the lyrics are provided below the name of the song. You can sing and follow along with a song if the words are hard to discern.
Pandora also gives you the option to share a particular song on a social media site (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), or to buy the song and download it onto your computer's music library.

, The Spotify app, found at https://www.spotify.com/us/, allows you to listen to almost any song ever recorded. Once you have the app downloaded, you can type in any artist name, song title, genre, etc. into the search bar at the upper left side of the app. You can click on ""+ New Playlist"" on the left side of the app to create a playlist. You can click, and drag songs onto the playlist so that they are always on hand.If you type in a particular artist name or genre, Spotify will produce hundreds, or even thousands of choices. When you click on one of them, Spotify will bring up the choice (genre, artist name, etc.), along with all the songs related to that choice. You can choose to listen to one of the songs, or all of them.
Spotify is a continuous music player, meaning that Spotify will play the next song on the list after the first one is finished, or as you are searching for other music to listen too. You should also note that Spotify has advertisements after every five songs or so.
You can also get Spotify as a mobile app so that you can listen to music all the time. Spotify also offers a radio feature, similar to Pandora, which can be clicked on, on the left side of the app.

, iHeartRadio works a lot like Pandora, except it gathers signals from actual radio stations around the country, rather than user-made stations. You can use its service both on the iHeartRadio website, and/or the iHeartRadio mobile app (which you can easily download directly from their website). Choose from hundreds of radio stations from different cities, or different states.Some radio stations are geared towards genres like country or rap, while others focus on eras of music or the radio station's personal preferences. You may want to listen to a grunge station if you haven't ever heard that type of music before, or maybe hit up an alternative station to find music which you know you will love.
The great thing about iHeartRadio is that you can switch back and forth between different stations at any time, even during commercial breaks.

, Soundcloud is a very innovative service, and unlike most other music streaming sites. It does the normal functions of any music site, such as streaming thousands of songs, and allowing you to search through them by genre, artist, title, etc. However, it also provides users the ability to post DJ remixes, or songs they have been working on. The Soundcloud community also plays around with lots of already recorded songs, changing the way they sound to make even more interesting music (see https://soundcloud.com/kinoroy/u-smile-justin-bieber-800).Soundcloud is fairly easy to use. You can either use the homepage, and listen to music for free, or become a user and manage your own account. Similar to other music sites, you can create playlists, and/or subscribe to other peoples' channels.
Another added benefit of Soundcloud is that mainstream music artists use the site to post songs they are currently working on, tracks which didn't make it onto their recent record, or independent singles they feel like releasing for free.

Restore the original files by Dragging-and-Dropping the desktop folder back onto the iTunes Library window.",How to Duplicate MP3 Files On iTunes,";
, Double-click the playlists name to open it in a new window.

,, This can be as simple as appending ""copy"" to the song title.

, This will re-import the exported files as duplicates, with the ID3 tags preserved.

Obtain music editing software.,
Browse to the song file (.mp3, .wma, or .wav) you wish to edit.,
Press the play icon on the toolbar and listen to the song until you reach the part of the song with the vulgar word.,
With your cursor, click and drag in the waveform area to select the duration of the inappropriate word.,
Press the stop icon (the orange square), click on the Generate menu, and select one of the following options:



Silence—This selection will eliminate all sound from the selection, creating a traditional ""radio edit."",
Tip for the really musically-inclined: Take an instrumental section that matches the key and rhythm of the offending section, and replace the offending section with the instrumental bit.,
Note the change of the waveform display.,
Test your edit.,
Enjoy your music without the profanity.

Continue zooming and rewinding until you can place your cursor on the exact part of the blue line that begins the foul word.

, Verify you have the right selection by clicking on the green Play arrow.

, Click ""Generate"" on the popup window to complete the silence.

Tone—This selection will make a tone with a pitch that you can vary in the window which appears. This is a ""television style"" edit. Use the settings shown:
If you're musically inclined, you can set the pitch of the beep to be the same as the key of the song. For example, if the song is in the key of A (major or minor), set frequency to 880Hz.
Keep the Amplitude low to begin with, especially if you don't choose Sine wave—you can always undo and make it a bit louder if it's too soft.
You can also click the Effect menu and select Wahwah, setting resonance to 6.0. This makes the voice make another traditional radio edit sound, while leaving the beat rather than silence, although it does not work for all curse words.

, Take care so that the inserted section is the same number of samples as the deleted section, and if possible, make sure the waveforms line up at the beginning and the end.

, If you inserted a tone, for example, you'll see what looks like a solid block:

, Rewind to a few seconds before the word, then press the play button to hear your effect. If it's not to your liking, simply undo, then try other methods till you find something acceptable.

,, Then, click the effects button again and at the top it will say Repeat Sliding Time Scale/Pitch Shift. Click that button two or three times more and for the f word it will make a sound like 'fuwwww' or for the b word 'bewwww'.

"
Unleash your muse.,
Practice this daily: First thing in the morning, when you're sitting down with your cup of coffee, tea, or diet soda, pull out a pen and paper.,
Pick the main subject of the song.,
Begin to develop your song.,
Put together the key points of the song.,
Develop the chorus.",How to Create Unique Lyrics for a Song2," So many times we start out writing a song by trying to squish what we want to say into four or eight bars with a couple rhymes and hopefully a hook. If we're lucky, we'll get the message out.


This is all well and great, but it's also not a very inspiring or unique way to write a song: we're locked in before we even begin. Instead, try just writing what's on your mind without the structure of a song.

,


Pick something in the room. Anything. It might be the coffee pot, or the mosquito that just landed on your arm. Write for ten to fifteen minutes about that object, in as much detail as you can. It can be accurate, or fanciful—but be as freely creative as you can be. Don't spend too long on this—you're not writing a song; think of it instead as exercising your creative brain so that when it's time, your brain will be ready to help you write a song.

, When you're ready to write a song, use the skills you've been developing by practicing every day. This time, instead of an object in the room, pick that which the song is about. It might be a girl, it might be a car. It could be an abstract concept like love, or a situation like riding on a train. Now, instead of cramming that into four rhyming lines, write a story about it, and use all your senses to describe the story.


It doesn't have to be well written, or even grammatically correct. Think of it more like a stream of consciousness ""thought poem,"" and write what comes to mind.
When you're done, examine your writing. What parts strike a particularly strong emotional chord within you? What parts are expository, and what parts bear repeating?

, Some songs tell a story, while some songs are small vignettes with a central theme. As you worked the writing exercise, you probably had a sense of which way your song would go.


If your song is a story, get it all out in the exercise. If it's vignettes, write several short stories that tie to that to the central theme, and another story that is all about the theme itself.
For example, Bob Dylan's Shelter From The Storm, while having some elements of a story, is more a series of vignettes that paint a picture of a time and place, and a life of hardships, but always come back to his benefactor: ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give you shelter from the storm.""
Another Dylan song, Lily, Rosemary, And The Jack Of Hearts, is a sequential narrative, and like Shelter From The Storm, always comes back to the focus: the Jack of Hearts

, These will form the backbone of the lyrics, the reason for each verse, the chorus, or both. Don't overdo it—you could end up with a 20-minute song! We'll stick to standard formats for now.


With your ideas for each verse sketched out, work out a verse that makes each point. Commonly, the point is made in the last line, with the first three lines building up support, reason, or rhyme for the last line.
Continue filling in the ""blanks,"" until each verse is complete. You may find that there are rhymes that can be reused in other verses, and some verses that stand on their own. Remember, this is your song, and the goal is to be unique. Don't worry if it doesn't follow a fixed formula—even rhymes can be tossed out if they don't fit!

, Generally, a song is about something. A good way to organize your song so that ""something"" is the highlight is to make it the chorus. Each verse feeds into the chorus, helping to lead the listener there and enabling them to understand.


For example, listen to Better Together from Jack Johnson. The chorus is simple: just a simple statement that's ""It's always better when we're together."" Each verse paints a picture of how everything else going on always leads to being back together, where it's better. You can write a song about something that you have been through or about your friends or about someone else's life. Good Luck.

"
"
Make your song deeply personal.,
Decide how you want to write your song: tune first or lyrics first.,
List things that you might want to say in your lyrics.,
Start with the chorus.,
Write in accent and dialect, but keep it natural.,
Think of an unusual rhythm for your lyrics.,
Listen carefully.,
Be literary.,
Be humorous.,
Create a thought-provoking title.",How to Create Unique Lyrics for a Song3," Give your audience the feeling of being let in on a secret, whilst also giving you a way to vent.

, You can also write them both at the same time, which can be much easier. Whichever you write second is likely to be harder because you have to fit it to the other part you wrote, so save your particular talent until second.


Some pretty well-know artists start with the melody, and then find the right words to fit. There's one song everybody knows that started out with only a melody. As the song was developed, the artist sang ""Scrambled eggs..."" When he was finished, Paul McCartney had written ""Yesterday.""
This is also a favorite technique of Peter Gabriel, who frequently uses nonsense syllables as he works out the melody, adding actual words only when the music has been decided on.

, Write as many ideas down as possible and words that relate to it (especially useful if you want to make your lyrics rhyme). Write as much detail as possible—remember it might not all go into your final lyrics. Express yourself!

, Sing it to yourself to make sure that the rhythm and words are together.

, The Arctic Monkeys have managed to rhyme ""something"" with ""stomach"" (summat, stomach).


While making words with different endings rhyme, and making dissimilar words flow is a definite plus, do not overdo this.
You can use regional sayings or phrases. This tends to make the piece sound native to a specific area. Also, a common thing for British bands is to use the accent to their advantage—like South Central Heroes—and this can create a very unique beat. However, there is no need to fake an accent or dialect just to make your song sound ""unique.""

, Maybe you could have lots of repeated lines, an unconventional rhyming scheme or a range of very short and very long lines.

, Pay attention to how people around you talk and what they talk about. You could base your lyrics around this.

, Make your song deeper and more interesting by using similes, metaphors and other literary devices.

, Include things that are funny or make references to current affairs and trends as people tend to remember them more. They also tend to date a song, and what began as a serious song can be seen as dated or even campy a few years down the line.

, Make sure it is relevant to your lyrics, but if it's only tangentially related, or just downright obscure, don't worry too much about it. Dylan's Rainy Day Women No. 12 and 35 means absolutely nothing to mere mortals (and perhaps not even to Mr. Dylan), but when he wrote that song, Everybody Must Get Stoned was not a title that would get any airplay or juke box positioning.


Be careful of overly-long names, like Joan Miro's Procession Through The Insides Of A Purple Antelope Across A Sea Of Tuna Fish by Adrian Belew. If you make your song name really long, people will either gloss over it (bad), make up their own name for it (risky), or it'll become a cult favorite simply because of the name. If the muse moves you to it, follow your muse.

Before you do anything else, you need to set your tempo.,
Source a kick drum.,
Add hi-hats.,
Move onto the snare and clap.,
Now for the vocal chop.",How to Create a House Beat," This is largely done to personal taste and should really be up to your imagination. There are house beats ranging from 110 Bpm (or even below) which is considerable slow, up to 130 Bpm which is pretty fast for house these days. Classic Chicago house used to be that fast.;
, The kick drum is the core of any house track, and therefore has to be perfect! You could sample one from another song, attain one from a sample pack, or even create one from scratch. When you have your chosen kick drum, have it play on every beat in the four-on-the-floor style that almost all house tracks follow. Extra hits can be added later; as for now, we want to focus on the sonic aspects of the sound. It is likely that you will have to EQ the kick to remove/boost certain frequencies. This is largely done to personal taste; but remember, tricks like removing mid frequencies makes the sound of the kick hollower and less acoustic sounding. Compression is another trick you can use to boost the overall level and bring out certain frequencies.

, Hi-hats are the foolproof way of adding momentum to a track. Program them in a recurring 16th-note pattern on the offbeat between each kick drum to start with. This is the standard pattern for house tracks, but feel free to improvise and add others in different places - as well as varying between open and closed hats. Recently, producers have been mixing their hats very bright, so you may want to follow suit and boost the high-end frequencies slightly. It might also be beneficial to remove some of the low-mid frequencies that can make the hi-hats sound muddy and thick.

, The snare needs to be full of crunch and snap, while the clap must be bright and piercing. Initially place them both on alternate kick beats, but then move the clap so that it falls slightly before the kick and the snare slightly after. These minor timing adjustments add swing to the groove. One individual also always slightly boosted the high-end of the clap and reduce the mid-end so that it falls into a slightly different frequency range than the snare. You might also want to pan the clap and snare a little left and right, to add a stereo image to the beat.

, This is an instant way to add originality and groove to an otherwise very basic, easily-replicated house beat. It would be best if you had an original recording; but if not, a sample will do the trick. You may need to re-pitch or timestretch the sample depending on the recording - if so, do it before we move on to the real modification. Play through the sample, listening out for individual syllables and breaths. Then slice these into single parts, and delete the ones that you don't feel are particularly inspiring. Now rearrange the remaining parts so that they are away from the kick drum and snare. You will find that this adds a whole new vibe to the beat without overpowering your original groove.

Your copyright is free and is automatic. The song must be “fixed” in some way, in a written down copy or a recording. You cannot have a copyright to a tune in your head that you do not write down or record in some fashion. You do not have to take any action to have this copyright. The actions that people refer to when they talk about “copyrighting a song” are steps to register and protect your copyright, which make it easier to prove that it is yours if some dispute arises., The word “copyright” is actually a single term that applies to several different rights that attach to a piece of music. If you are the original writer, singer, and recording artist, you may have all the copyrights to the song. But if you wrote a song and Taylor Swift recorded it, you would have the copyright to the written song, and she would have the copyright to her recorded version of it., Included in your ""bundle of rights"" are several separate rights or licenses. You can keep part of the copyright to yourself, and license away another part, for example. The different rights, broken into their separate parts, are:Public performing right. If you are the owner of a song, you have the right to control its performance or transmission in public.
Public performing license. A license is a permission that can be granted to someone for a specific purpose. A public performing license is a permission that can be granted to someone else to perform your song. If you register your music through a publishing company like BMI, the company will manage public performing licenses for you.
Reproduction right. As the owner of the copyright of a song, you control who may reproduce your song in a record, cassette, CD, online or any other format.
Mechanical license. A mechanical license is a permission to someone to reproduce and distribute a specific composition at an agreed price. Signing a recording contract will involve a mechanical license.
Synchronization license. A synchronization license is permission granted for the use of a song or recording to accompany a visual performance, such as background music for a movie, television show or video.

, If you have written a song (lyrics, music, or both), you may register that song, completely for free, with any of several commercial licensing agencies. Registering with these agencies is designed to help you sell licensed use of your song, but it does not provide legal protection for your copyright.


Some of the most popular licensing agencies are ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.), or HFA (The Harry Fox Agency, Inc.)., Some people have described a ""poor man's copyright"" as a free substitute for registration with the U.S. Copyright Office. This gimmick involves mailing yourself a copy of your song, and then supposedly using the postmark as proof of copyright. You are free to do this, if you wish, but realize that this is no legal protection of your copyright., If you've written a song, you have the copyright. Done. It's automatic, by law. However, protecting that copyright means you may need to incur a small fee. You can register your song(s) with the U.S. Copyright Office for $35. This registration is strong protection of your copyright, because any other writer who comes along later cannot claim a song that is already registered. Formal registration will be well worth the money if there is ever a dispute later on.

, To preregister a song or to register a song online, you must create an account online with the U.S. Copyright Office. Begin by visiting the website at www.Copyright.gov.Select the link to “Register a Copyright” and then select the button to “Log in to eCO.”, If this is your first time conducting business on this site, you will need to create an account. Choose the button for “New User.” You will then see a screen to create your account. You will need to enter the following information:Name
Email address
Userid (you will create one)
Password (you will create one)
Challenge question, as a security tool in case you forget your password
Choose “Next” when you are ready to move on.

, On the next screen, you will be prompted to provide your address and telephone number. After you enter all this information, click on “Next” at the bottom of the screen., After you enter all your information to create your online account, you will be shown a notice that the copyright.gov website does not capture any credit card numbers for any payment. When you read this notice, choose “Finish” at the bottom of the screen, and your account will be ready for use., Preregistration of a copyright is a step that notifies the U.S. Copyright Office that you have a song or other creative work in process and that is likely to be mass produced in some form. It is not the same as registration and does not have the same legal meaning. For a song to be eligible for pre-registration, the following must apply:For a sound recording, at least some of the sound must already exist in a recorded form, although the final product does not need to be completed yet, and you must verify that you have a “reasonable expectation” that the work will be commercially distributed.
For a song composition, at least some of it must be written or recorded in some format, the song is intended for use on a mass produced record or movie soundtrack, and you must have a “reasonable expectation” that the work will be commercially distributed.

, Preregistration is a step that is only available online through the eCO system. To access the system, begin at the copyright.gov home page, select “Register a Copyright,” and then “Log in to eCO.”, In the box in the top left of the next screen, you will see a place to enter the userid and password that you defined when you created your account. Enter those here and select “Login.”

, In the middle of the list, under the heading of “Copyright Registration,” select “Preregister a Claim.” The screen will change automatically to the next step., The next screen contains information about the preregistration process. Read through this information to be sure that you wish to preregister, and then continue. Select “Start Preregistration.”, You will have six different choices, and you may select one or more of them. Choose whichever apply to the work that you are preregistering. Make sure that whatever you choose represents the rights that you hold. For example, do not claim the copyright in the sound recording of a song, if you were the writer but not the performer. The choices are:Musical composition
Sound recording
Literary work in book form
Computer program
Motion picture
Advertising or marketing photograph
Move on to the next step by selecting “Continue” at the top of the screen.

, This may be a working title, which could change when the final copy is produced, but you do need to enter a title for the work. If the work that you are preregistering is an album or other collection of songs, you need to give only the album title at this time., The next screen is to list the titles of individual songs. Provide as many as you know, with the current titles. This all may change for the final product.

, On the next screen, list the name of the author or authors of the work. If you wish to be known by a pseudonym, then enter that name.

, The claimant, in most cases, will be the same as the author. However, sometimes the copyright claimant may be different than the author. For example, if the author is writing a song as a work for hire for a movie, then the movie publisher may be the claimant of the copyright., The next screen will ask you to identify three important dates to identify your claim in the song:


the date you began creating the song
the date you anticipate creating the work
the date you anticipate commercial distribution

, This description does not need to be very thorough, but enough to be able to identify it in case of a later claim of infringement. Your description is limited to 2000 characters, or about 300 words.

, After you have completed all prior steps for preregistration, you will be asked to certify that you are in fact the copyright holder for the song or album that you described and that you have a reasonable expectation that the work will be commercially distributed in the near future.There is no fee for preregistration.
When you certify your claim, you are warned that you are making a statement under oath and that falsifying a claim may be a federal offense.

, Preregistration is not sufficient to protect your copyright completely. To do that, you must register your copyright within three months after the first publication of the finished work, or within one month if you become aware that someone else has infringed on your copyright., Your registration will be processed more quickly and has a cheaper filing fee if you submit it online. But if you do not have access to the Internet, or if you just prefer to send it by mail, you may do so. The registration is equally valid either way. The instructions in the next few steps (except the login step) will apply equally to online registration or paper registration. To request paper copies of the registration forms, you can call the Copyright Office at (202) 707–3000 or 1 (877) 476–0778 (toll free). You will need to ask for form SR if you are registering a sound recording of a song, or form PA if you are recording the written lyrics or music, without a recording.
If you have access to a computer, you can find and print these forms at http://www.copyright.gov/eco/.

, To access the registration system online, begin at the copyright.gov home page, select “Register a Copyright,” and then “Log in to eCO.”, In the box in the top left of the next screen, you will see a place to enter the userid and password that you defined when you created your account. Enter those here and select “Login.”

, Under the heading of “Copyright Registration,” select the option “Register a New Claim.” You will be directed automatically to the next screen., The next screen will prompt you with three questions. Your answers to those questions will determine the appropriate application for registering your work.The three questions are:


Are you registering one work? If you have a single song to copyright, you will respond “yes.” If you have a collection or a full album, you will respond “no.”
Are you the only author an owner of the work? If you wrote the song by yourself, respond “yes.” If you collaborated with one or more other people, say “no.”
Does the work contain material by only this one author? If you sampled other music in your song, for instance, you will respond “no.” Otherwise, choose “yes.”

, There are several choices, to begin the identification of your copyrighted work. Review the list on the dropdown menu, and make your selection. Be careful in making your selection. Once you have chosen the type, you cannot change it. You would have to cancel this entire registration session and start over again. The choices for literary type are:Literary work
Work of visual arts
Sound recording - this will be your selection if you are copyrighting a particular recorded version of a song
Work of the performing arts - this will be your selection if you are copyrighting a written song, but not the actual recording of the song
Motion picture/AV work
Single serial issue
Select “Continue” after you have made your selection.

, If you only have a working title, provide that. If the work is untitled, then type in “untitled.”On the same screen, you are asked to say whether this piece appears as part of a larger work. This would include a song that is part of an album, or a short story that is part of a collection.
Click on “Continue” when you are ready to go on.

, For this purpose, publication means offering the song for sale or other public distribution. A public performance of the work does not constitute publication.Respond yes or no to the drop down question. Then you will be prompted to give your preregistration number, if you preregistered this work.

, The author is the person who wrote the song. The claimant may be the same person as the author, or it may be someone else. For example, if you wrote a song for hire, to be used in a movie, you would be the author, but the movie producer may be the claimant., If your work contains parts of other previously copyrighted works, you will need to identify the original works here. For example, if your song takes samples from other songs, you need to identify those original works.This is a step that may require the assistance of an attorney, if you need help deciding how much use is acceptable as “fair use” or public domain.

, This is an optional step. If you have registered your works with a music clearinghouse, you may wish to identify that organization here for copyright management or permission to use your work., The correspondent is the person who should be contacted by the U.S. Copyright Office if there are any questions about this copyright registration. You may name yourself, or you may choose to appoint a manager or attorney., When your registration has been processed completely, the U.S. Copyright Office will mail you a copyright certificate. You need to give the complete name and address for mailing that certificate., If you fall into one of three special categories, you may be able to request special handling of your registration. This will speed the process for your claim to go through the U.S. Copyright Office and to return your copyright certificate. To request special handling, one of the following three conditions must apply:you are involved in pending or prospective litigation
there is some customs issue related to the song

Think of the tempo of your song.,
Consider what style of music the song should be.,
Experiment with similar music.,
One thing to keep in mind before you go to the next step, is that although most of the music you've listened to is probably intricately made and thought out by brilliant musical minds (especially if you've listened to bands such as Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones), some of the best music is made up of simple segments arranged in the right way (think more of the Ramones or Nirvana).,
Start thinking about the music you can put to your own lyrics.,
At this stage, you should begin to think about testing the music that you picked.,
So now you have your lyrics, and you should now have music, or at least an idea of the music that you want the lyrics to be backed to.,
You should have a majority of the song compiled by now, and you must bring it all together.,
After stamping out the final minor critiques from other people, you have now successfully converted your song lyrics into a full song.

",How to Convert Song Lyrics to a Song," Is it slow? Fast? You have to consider this, or else you will not know how to continue. You also have to consider whether the lyrics make sense with the speed that you want the song to be.
, You do not want to have a loving ballad backed up by death metal, because it will not make any sense. On the opposite end of that, you do not want your death metal song to be played on the ukulele, because it also would not make sense. Use your lyrics to think of how the song should sound.

, Listen to music which you feel has a similar style, and analyze how they build up the song, how the verses bridge to one another, and how powerful the chorus sounds. I would recommend using well known bands for this, since if they are well known as good musicians, they will generally have some knowledge of this process. Just thoroughly analyze every aspect of the song.

, The KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) method is sometimes the best method, and it can be applied directly to arranging music. Don't try to go over the top right off the bat, make sure that you have all of your bases covered and that everything that you are doing makes sense.

, Do you have the necessary instrumental abilities? Will you need other people to help you? Some songs will only sound good when the bass and guitar are played together, and some songs sound good with no bass. You have to consider all of the mixes of instruments and how you want your song to come off to others.

, Get out your guitar, bass, drums, whatever you play, and put it along with your lyrics. Have somebody that you know help you with this, to tell you whether it sounds good together from another perspective, now that you finally can try your ideas in real time., Always continue to improve on your idea, and never second guess what you do. If you believe that the song flows properly and that you know that your idea will stick, then keep it., Get your final changes to the tiny details that remain, and make sure that the song flows properly, and do not have any pauses where they should not be. Basically, finish up all of the minor touches. Make sure that you have other people hear it since they will be better for critiquing your work than you will. They will be able to point out any minor flaws or tell you what needs to be emphasized more with the good parts.

"
Think about the main theme of the song.,
Decide what instruments will have the glory, or technically speaking, the melody.,
Decide what instruments will play the ""behind"" part, or harmony.,
Start to write.,
Keep adding!,
Make a final copy of your music.,
Practice!,
Don't rush, good things come to those who wait.

",How to Compose a Song for a Band," After you decide what that will be, build on it. Say the theme is a man walking down a street. Well, you need to build on that! Make the audience think about what you are trying to express. Is he walking down a street at night, to a bar? If so, then the music might be something jazzy. If it's some seven-year-old girl skipping down the sidewalk to Peppy's Ice Cream, then the song will probably not be slow or jazzy. It would ideally be faster and ""bouncy"".;
, Going back to the man walking to a bar at night, you probably would want low voices (instrumental wise, not real voices) like Bass Clarinet, Tenor Saxophone, Trombone, or Baritone Sax. The preppy fun girl would probably be flutes or clarinets. You can also have a combination of instruments for the melody. For example, Bass Clarinet and Sax, or flute and clarinet.

, If you have a lower instrument playing the melody, you might want a higher instrument playing the harmony.

, Print out some manuscript paper and jot down everything you have. To transpose the song, see the tips for what key most common instruments are. But for now, let's say your transposing what you have on piano to Bb Trumpet. This means that on the trumpet, a 'C' would sound like a 'Bb' on Piano. So if the trumpet needs to play 'C' then you write it down as 'Bb'. Just go down one whole step (B, Bb)to see what the notes should be. This may sound confusing, but it won't when you do it.

, Let your imagination and creativity fly! Make the 1-page song a 5-page song! But don't get off the theme too much! If the slow jazzy feel turns into the faster preppy sound too suddenly, it won't make sense.

, That way it won't have eraser marks/scratch-outs form pen/white out on it. There are even programs out there where you just print out the notes. One is the Finale Notepad, available for free download at http://www.finalemusic.com/notepad/.

, Make sure it sounds alright, and adjust it accordingly.

Produce your song.",How to Construct a Blues Song," The best thing to do before you construct your own blues music is listen to the blues. Simply listening gives you a basic understanding of the structure, emotion, and overall sound. Take some time to relax and listen to a handful of different artists, jotting down notes when you hear something you feel inspired by.


A few classic songs you can listen to include “Memphis Blues” by W.C. Handy, “Crazy Blues” by Mamie Smith, “Pine Top Boogie” by Pine Top Smith, “Dust my Broom” by Elmore James, and “Boogie Chillun” by John Lee Hooker.;
, Get a pen and paper and start making a list of every concept, perspective, or potential lyric that pops into your head. Remember that blues music is raw and full of emotion, so let yourself feel every thought that comes to mind.Allow these ideas to guide and inspire the content of your song as you move forward.


The key here is not getting tied up in perfection. This is just creative brainstorming meant to get ideas flowing that will later lead to your perfect song.
Let ideas brew for a while. Bring a notepad with you wherever you go so that if you feel inspired, you can capture the thought on paper regardless of whether you’re in a meeting, at the gym, or cooking a meal.

, After you’ve spent time brainstorming ideas, choose your favorite topic to start constructing your song. It should be something you feel passionate about and can relate to in some way or another. You want your music to feel and sound believable.


Some common blues topics include love sickness & heartache, gambling, depression, discrimination, good times, religion, and superstition., Blues music has a three-line verse structure where the second line repeats the first - A A B. In the first line state the problem. In the second line you repeat the first line. In the third line state the solution (or consequence). In the fourth line, state the second half of the solution (or consequence.) The third and fourth line can be written separately or in one line depending on your preference.For example, “I went to the river, fell down to my knees.” “I went to the river, fell down to my knees.” “Have mercy dear Lord,” “save Mary if you please.”
The repetition of the first line gave artists time to think of the third line because singers often improvised the words.Many blues songs feature a short instrumental break after each line, a sort of call and response., You want your lyrics to flow nicely from line to line instead of sounding choppy or awkward. Notice that “I went to the river, fell down to my knees” has 11 syllables. Then notice that lines 3 and 4, “Have mercy dear Lord, save Mary if you please,” also has 11 syllables. As a rule of thumb, how ever many syllables are in the first line should be the same, or nearly the same, in the third and fourth combined.While not all blues songs are constructed with this formula, it’s a great way to get started.

, In order to keep establishing a nice flow to your song and avoid awkwardness, you'll want to make sure your lyrics rhyme. The first two lines repeat, the third doesn't matter, and the fourth line should rhyme with the first line.


Repeat this rhyming pattern for every verse of lyrics.

, Following the A A B formula, write about four verses or so on your chosen topic. Use your inspiration from brainstorming to write your lyrics and stay true to your emotion. You want your listener to understand how you’re feeling and relate to it in one way or another.

, Unless you are a top-selling blues artists, the first draft of your song probably won’t be perfect. That’s okay! Take your time going over the lyrics and making changes so that you have stronger material.


If you’re struggling to come up with content, take a break for a few hours, or even days, to give your mind some rest. Maybe listen to some more blues music for ideas or just go for a walk to clear your head. Then, when you’re ready, revisit your song and let your new inspiration sink in.

, Most blues music has four beats in a bar, use three four-bar phrases, and are built on the 12-bar blues form. Knowing this basic form will lay the foundation for your song.While most blues music follows these three rules, remember that your music can be whatever you want it to be so feel free to play around and make any changes you want.

, Your chord options are A, B, C, D, E, F and G. Blues music uses only 3 chords: the tonic (chord 1), the subdominant (chord IV), and the dominant (chord V), so choose your three favorite chords to use.For example, if your first chord is C, then your fourth would be F because it is the fourth from the main one. Your fifth cord would be G because it is the fifth from the main one.

, After you’ve established the three cords you’re going to use, you want to create your bars. There are four beats in each bar and there is a basic pattern for these bars that blues music follows.The form is pretty simple. Your first bar is 1 (tonic), 1 (tonic), 1 (tonic), 1 (tonic). The second bar is 4 (subdominant), 4 (subdominant), 1 (tonic), 1 (tonic). Your third bar is 5 (dominant), 5 (dominant), 1 (tonic), 1 (tonic).
A new bar is indicated with | so the form is written as 1 1 1 1 | 4 4 1 1 | 5 5 1 1.

, If you were working with the key of C your first three bars are CCCC | FFCC | GGCCJust like that you’ve created a 12 bar blues form! You have four beats in your bar and three bars, which all adds up to be 12.Listen to Robert Johnson’s “Crossroad Blues” or “Sweet Home Chicago” for some examples of the A A B / 12-bar blues form., Now that you have your lyrics and your bars, you need to put it all together. Arrange lyrics into verses if they aren’t already and make sure they follow the bars you came up with. Just keep repeating the 12 bar form you came up with until you’ve got a beat for every lyric.


It can be helpful to write your lyrics on a notepad with the bars below them. For example: “I hate to see the evening sun go down” with CCCC written below it. “I hate to see the evening sun go down” with FFCC written below it. “‘Cause my man he done left this town” with GGCC written below it. Keep repeating this order of bars under all of your lyrics until you’ve finished.

, Almost no song is going to be a showstopper the first time. Start practicing your song and keep practicing until you love the way it sounds. Sing your lyrics until you have them memorized. Don’t be afraid to make revisions here and there to get your song to where you want it.


You might find it helpful to first practice on your instrument and master the tune before you start practicing the lyrics.
Remember, practice makes perfect so don’t get discouraged if you don’t love your song the first few times you hear it.

, If you’d like the world to hear your creation, contact a producer or self-produce your song. You can share it with your friends and family so everyone can appreciate your work!


SoundCloud is a great way to share new music with the world.Create an account, edit your profile, and then upload your track. Use hashtags to get people’s attention and keep up with everyone’s questions and comments.
If you aren’t comfortable sharing your music, don’t feel like you have to. You can create music for your own enjoyment too.

Write out your story.,
Take a highlighter and highlight the 2-4 most important parts.,
Write one stanza (usually 4-6 lines) for each main detail of the story.,
The next step is to think of the chorus.,
Write out a pre-chorus if you feel the song needs one.,
Write the bridge to the song.,
Decide on a song format.,
Write a catchy tune!",How to Convert a Story Into a Hip Hop Song," Even if you know the story like the back of your hand, you still need to write it down. Include every detail you'd like to include in the song. This step sounds simple but once you start becomes very difficult when you try to include everything. Keep it short enough to turn into lyrics unless you plan on writing a hip hop ballad.;
, Underline the details that correspond to the important parts. Take out all the unimportant bits that won't be going into the song, and then rewrite it onto another sheet of paper if you'd like, to keep it clean.

, Make sure it rhymes, and put each stanza together so that it forms one long poem. These will be the verses to your song, since they tell the story well.

, This is a little harder, since the chorus usually doesn't tell a story- it basically sums it up. Stop and think: what is the main feeling you want the story to give? If it's a happy song about something encouraging, try to write a stanza describing that happiness. If it tells the story of a break up, make the chorus a reflection of the feelings you had going through the break up.

, A pre-chorus is just a short couple of lines that comes before the chorus but isn't actually part of the chorus. An example of a pre-chorus would be in Taylor Swift's ""You Belong With Me,"" when she sings ""she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's cheer captain..."" until it reaches the chorus. This step is optional.

, Generally this is only 1-2 lines that repeat over a few times towards the end of the song. The bridge doesn't have to have anything to do with the chorus- you could make it focus on a certain part of the story, or the entire story at once.

, Figure out the order in which you're going to put the verses and the chorus. A popular form is Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Verse, Chorus.

, Now that you have the actual lyrics, put them to a tune or ask someone else to write one for you if you struggle with it. Once you have a tune, you can sing your very own song and share it with others! Congratulations- you have just written your very own hip hop song based on a story!

"
"
Think about what the topic of the song is going to be.,
Imagine the different scenes of each verse.

,
Try to stick to a 3-verse format.,
Think of and channel an emotion.,
Decide on the angle you desire to discuss in your song (violence, the effects, the story, etc).

,
Start from either the beginning or the end.,
Roll with whatever comes to your mind - but make sure it makes sense.

",How to Compose the First Verse of a Song,";
,, Put either the verse or the chorus first.

, If you want to write a song about love try to think of that feeling of having heartbreak, or falling in love.

,, It is sometimes more productive if you work backward. Let's say the song is about a person messing around with your best friend - if you start from the end, start with a sad scene. For instance: ""Trapped in time, and I don't know what to do/These friends of mine, I can see right through/You don't got to tell me, I know what to do/I'm just sitting' back here, sharing' in the groove"" Written by Mike Gordon and performed by Phish.

Don't give the improvisation everything you've got straight away- start it simple and relaxed, and give it somewhere to go.

,
Try building upon a motif/idea- for example, a simple rhythmic or melodic phrase that is repeated, and then slowly altered in a manner which is interesting and sounds good.

,
Quote!,
Learn a few ""tricks"" you can use if you run out of ideas halfway through- for example, melodic lines or even impressive sounding, simple exercises- for example, the Hanon exercises.

,
Alter the way you play passages.,
Listen to many jazz artists to get the idea, and even transcribe some of their passages and use them in your own solos!,
And, finally, do whatever you enjoy, and whatever sounds good.

,
Be aware of what is happening in the band before you begin your solo.,
Have an approximate idea of what you want your solo to sound like before you start and where you want it to go.,
With context in mind, work out a suitable motif, emotional tone and/or message to start your solo with that enhances the music of the band.,
Develop your solo towards the idea you had in point number two, working with the band, interacting with it and keeping your ears open.

,
Don't be afraid of repetition.,
Consider varying different aspects of your solo - volume, timbre, melodic tension, pitch, silence.,
Once you feel you have achieved point number two, wrap up your solo, all the while listening to the band.,
Acknowledge the audience's reaction.

",How to Build a Jazz Improvisation,",, In other words, reference another song that is in the same key, or you have transposed to be so. Don't overdo it, you could even just play a few lines from, say, star wars, or a well known pop song.

,, For example, you could lay back on the beat for effect, or even push ahead to do similarly.

, It'll sound good to those who don't know the passages, and you'll be respected by those who do!

,, Be aware of the type of song, its genre, its meaning, its emotional tone. In other words, be aware of context.;
, In other words, what effect you would you like to create on the audience. This can change later on as the band audience react.

, It can be anything: burning intense a la John Coltrane in My Favourite Things or simple and understated a la Joe Henderson in Song For My Father.

,, It builds affinity and agreement and can generate excitement in the audience. Carried on too long though, it generates boredom.

, These are all tools for you to use to achieve your communication.

, You may need to play some phrases to ""wind down"" your solo if it got really intense, or you can even just stop right at the peak. Either way it should be a self-determined action.

It will help to learn all about music theory.,
You may want to take easy and well-known pieces and try to switch them around, make your own variation of them, change the key (also known as transposing a key), and read music charts while even alternating the chords.,

Create a rough draft.,
Utilize contrary motion.Contrary motion is the technique of having one line go down while the others go up.,
Consider carefully the structure of the piece; if it has sections make them clear, and keep the listener interested.,
If you are a student, go to your music teacher and ask him/her for help.,
Use counterpoint.",How to Compose Music1," You will need to be able to play something at least at a basic level. Please do not assume piano is the only way to go. Yes it is conventional, but many composers have begun their compositional careers on instruments such as the guitar, oboe and clarinet.;
,, the most powerful scale tool musicians have is the diatonic modes, which are just scales, starting on different root notes. You should also understand scales and chords and remember them.

, Take a class in high school or college, or even teach yourself via the internet. You will need the knowledge regardless of how you learn it.

, Be creative!

,, Some helpful things to look up for an accompaniment would be chord progressions and scale knowledge. Remember that music theory was made so each musician wouldn't have to experiment as much when making music.

, Know which instruments fit into the category of music (e.g. String Quartet ~ 2 violins, viola, cello; Brass Quintet: 2 trumpets, horn, trombone, tuba).

, Play by ear. Play things and see if they sound good together. If you want to be able to play the same thing again later, try using a MIDI keyboard. It can be hooked up to a computer, and will print your notes onto sheet music for you. A good computer composing program is Audacity

, This takes a lot of practice and dedication, but is a great composing tool.

, Write the note combinations that sound good to your ear. With guitar, write down the chords and guitar lines you play. It will help you to be familiar with music so you can name the chords and know the notes/scales that should be played along with the chord.

, Just like a written composition in English class, music requires multiple revisions before the final piece is ready. Build off your melody. The best thing here is to use your imagination. Don't forget about dynamics, expressions, or articulation. for more ideas.

, This is an extremely useful technique that will rapidly improve the sound of your piece.

, Try to think where the listener will become bored, and be brutal with your judgments. Also, read up on musical forms.

, Often you will find they are more willing than you assume.

, It is a defining feature of common practice era music, and will make your piece sound really amazing. "
"
Start from the rhythmic foundation (percussion and bass), the chord progression (guitar and/or keys), or the melody (lead guitar/keys).,
Create a groovy bass line that complements the melody but doesn't copy it note for note (use counterpoint for example).

,
Make a drum beat starting with just the kick and snare that complements and supports the bassline.,
Create a rhythm or beat that complements the core or foundation of the song.,
Play individual notes randomly, then see which ones sound good playing at the same time and use that to build chords from scratch.

,
While you write the music, write lyrics to the song.,
Make sure you put in all the essential elements: Intro, verse, hook, bridge (optional), and outro/CODA.,
Pick a key idea of the song or a catchy phrase and a cool guitar or keyboard lick to create a melody.,
Once you have it to this point add a pad, sound effects, lead parts, etc.

,
If your song ""tastes"" or sounds right then you've done a good job!

,
Record your song then listen to it as a music critic would you listen.,
Go back and make any adjustments you need to.",How to Compose Music2," Songs have a definite structure to them. You want to get to the foundation as soon as you can, to create a strong base for your piece.

,, Note: just lay down a basic beat to act as a template. Once you go to the other sections you can return to change things up a little based on the progressive sound of the song. Quite often I find I have a vision of what I'm trying to write and it will morph into something new. You have to be able to make adjustments along the way.

, Start with a basic chord progression then build and change it from there. For example a chord progression may use I, III, and V (ex C, E, G) and fall into a: I, III, pattern for example (where I is the root of the chord and III and V are the next two higher notes in the chord).

,, You may have lyrics, then tailor a song to match them, or do the lyrics after the rhythm. The thing to keep in mind to to ensure you tell a good story. Don't be afraid to change lyrics or the music to achieve the best mutual fit.

, Let the lyrics help guide you if you have lyrics.

, Choose the mood or style of the song. You'll know you're there when you can't get the phrase (known as a ""lick) out of your head! Quite often a 2-8 word phrase will do it (i.e. ""shoulder lean"", ""love shack, baby love shack"", etc).

,,, Would you listen to it on the radio or change the station? Let others listen to it and make suggestions.

, But remember that too many adjustments may make your song sound or ""taste"" terrible, so don't over correct.

"
"
Keep in mind that some of these steps are - clearly - for songs with guitars.,
Pick a scale/mode for a note.,
Find out the chord configuration for that scale or mode,.,
Come up with a drum beat.,
Write the rhythm and lead guitar riffs .,
Add the other instruments.,
Write the lyrics if you have them.,Add the extras such as solos, etc.",How to Compose Music3," You don't have to follow all of them exactly - in fact, some of them can just be omitted if you don't need them for the kind of music you play. But do follow the general outline and ideas.

, Any one works. If you're writing a progressive song, then you have the option of picking more than one, just make sure the two aren't the same thin. Check out the notes in each scale and make sure that they are significantly different. The chromatic scaleis usually sonically pleasing.

, The major scale starting from the first ""degree"" is as follows: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished, seventh, ninth. Add chords of two to four notes to some melody notes to produce harmony.

, Don't overdo and try to ""display all your talent,"" especially if the tempo of the song doesn't call for it. Try different beats and speeds, known as tempo, of the beats from an electronic drum source. Start with a slow tempo and insert the melody into the rhythm.

, If you're writing an upbeat song, you can use full or barre chords, power chords or both. If you're writing a slow, calm song, only use full/barre chords, or there will be nothing in the song worth listening to. If you're going for the heavy metal song, then you can use the higher note/bass note patterns that ""At the Gates"" popularized for flavor or groove, although it's not recommended that you do it a whole lot or else you'll seem like you're hopping on the mallcore train), power chords can provide the chord progression, and full/barre chords can add something different.


, Bass can follow the chord progression, but also has the option of doing whatever as long as it stays in the key everyone else is playing in. Keyboards or pianos generally follow the chord progression, although some bands have keyboardists that follow the lead guitar part.

, Come up with the chorus, bridge, etc. Progressive songs don't necessarily need the song structure .

The software to cut noise and add special effects can be anywhere from free (Audacity) to a rental (Adobe Audition). Record something...most memorable parts....hardest parts...parts that don't work. Fix them in your head. Rewrite them., It is easy to chuck stuff in your head: Just write a different part for it. Don't worry. If you really learned the melody, then working on counterpoint will hurt nothing. The good patterns will stick.

What matters is how much you chuck. If you didn't make two parts work when you were singing them together, then when you write them, you can transpose them. If you have the necessary range, then you can transpose them in your head. Even if you don't have the necessary range, you can transpose them in your imagination.

Of course, this isn't required. However, the more you understand about music, the easier it will be to understand when musical concepts are being explained.


We will be using musical terms in this article because it is difficult to explain these ideas without them. Some will be explained but others are too complex to cover in a simple sentence. If you do not understand things like beats, measures, and time, you might want to do some reading first.;
, The song form is sort of like a gender but for music. All music generally falls into a set shape, or form, which determines what parts sound like what other parts and when changes happen. You are probably most used to this concept in popular music, with the ideas of chorus and verse. Now, you don't have to follow these set forms, but it can help give you a road-map to work with when writing your melody.


The most common song form is called AABA. This means that there are two ""verses"", a ""chorus"", and then another ""verse"". In other words, a section that sounds one way, then another that sounds the same, then something different, then a return to the theme of the first section.
There are many different forms however, so do some research to find which one is best for you. You can consider AAAA, ABCD, AABACA, etc. Or you can break from this entirely, of course.

, Some genres of music have a certain style to them and if you want to achieve that ""sound"", you'll need to write your melody in a particular way. Read up on the genre of music you're trying to write for before writing, to find out if there are any unique features of that genre in terms of the structure, key, or progressions.


For example, the chord progression for blues and jazz follow particular forms. Jazz makes heavy use of particular chords, so you'll want to look up jazz chords before writing songs like that.

, No matter who is performing the piece of music you write, they're going to need a break at some point. Fingers will need a moment of rest and singers will need to breathe. You should understand how breaks are put into a song and then add in moments like this. Try to space them evenly and make them frequent enough that the song is not impossible to perform.

, One thing you can do to help your melody writing skills is to start by breaking down some of your favorite songs. Gather a handful of songs with great melodies and then put of your listening ears. Usually when we listen to music, we get lost in it, right? But you're going to make a road-map from it...so focus!


Write down how the notes change. How do they build? How does the key make you feel? How does the melody work with the lyrics? What's good about the melody? What doesn't work or what could be better? You can transfer these lessons to your own melodies.

, If you're naturally a better lyricist, you might find that you're inclined to start from lyrics. However, this is tricky and is not recommended, especially if your musical training is very limited. When you start from lyrics, you need to base your melody on the natural rhythm of the words and that can be very difficult, especially for a beginner. However, if you want to, you can start with lyrics.

, It seems kind of silly but many of the best melodies were born from someone just hitting random notes on a piano. If you have an instrument that you can mess around on, try this. Just play around, making patterns or just jumping around until you find something that sounds good.


If you don't have an instrument, you can sing or use an online instrument. You can find many free pianos on websites and on apps available for your mobile device.

, You can take a really simple idea for a melody, just a progression of three or four notes, and transform that nugget of an idea into an entire melody. For example, take a small group of notes that you found using the playing around from the previous step. Think about where you feel the melody should go from there.


People who are naturally musically-inclined will often just come up with little bits of music like this, like how an artist might get an idea for a painting. If this describes you, keep a digital voice recorder or a notebook (if you know any kind of music notation)

, If you're used to making chords, you can find a melody by playing around with chords as well. This is common for people who play piano or guitar, since those instruments rely heavily on chords. Do the same sort of playing around that we talked about in Step 1, but with chords, until you find something that sounds good to you.


You can find websites that play chords for you if you don't have an instrument to work with or you don't know a lot of chords.
Try humming along to the chords and mess around with ways to make it more complex. Since you can only make one sound at a time, you'll find you have a melody before you know it. Don't worry about lyrics right away: professional musicians almost always write a melody first and use nonsense sounds in place of words.

, Stealing someone's song sounds like a pretty bad idea, but like taking a transplant to grow your own garden bed, you can take the tiniest sliver from another song and transform it into something completely different. If you take only a progression of four or so notes and make enough changes, then your music is still perfectly original. Just remember that you're making it into something completely different.


A good exercise is to borrow from a different genre of music. Say you want to write a folk song, for example. Try borrowing from rap. Want to write a country song? Borrow from classical.

, A motif is a set of notes that form a musical ""idea"". Many songs take a motif and then repeat that set of notes, with small changes, in order to create the melody. If you're struggling to come up with a melody, this is a great fallback option since you only need to start with a handful of notes.


One of the best examples of this is the allegro con brio from Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. He took just a basic motif and repeated it over and over again and created one of the most iconic pieces of music ever.

, With your melody in place, you'll want to write a bass part to go with it. Yes, you might not have a bass in your piece (you could be writing for a trumpet quartet for all we know). However, a bassline is for more than just a bass. The bassline refers to any background part for a low pitched instrument. This bassline acts as a sort of spine for the musical piece and provides .


A bassline can be simple or it can be complex, can be fast or it can be slow. In some genres of music, the bassline follows a particular pattern, as in jump blues where it is almost always a scale of quarter notes. The only important part is that it fits with and supports the melody you have written.

, If you didn't start by working with chords, you might want to add some now. Chords will make your song sound more full and complex, although you can leave them out or use only very simple chords if you want a more melancholy, bare sound.


Start by establishing what key your melody was written in. Certain chords sound better with certain keys than others. For example, if your song starts with a C, then a C chord will be a natural place to start.
When you switch between chords will really depend on your song, but try to time the changes to significant sounds or changes in the melody. Generally, chord changes will happen on the downbeat, at or towards the beginning of a measure. You can also use a chord change to lead into another chord. For example, in a 4/4 song, you might have one chord on the downbeat of one and then another on 4, before leading into the chord change at one in the next measure.

, A melody will account for a large portion of a song but many songs also have sections which break from the melody or make use of a second melody. This might be a chorus or a bridge, or even another type of section altogether. Breaks from the melody like this can add a bit of ""bang"" or drama to your song, so if you're looking for that kind of feeling, consider this break from the melody.

, Play your melody for other people and get their opinions. You don't have to take all of their ideas but they might see (or rather, hear) things that you don't. If several people give you the same feedback, it might be necessary to make a change to your melody or the additions you made.

Know that before the bassline is written, it is essential to know the chords of a song.,
Find the roots of the chord on the bass instruments or write them out on a bass clef with the melody and chords.

,
Repeat.,
To smooth out the bassline, use scales or small jumps to connect the chords together.,
Check the melody.,
At this point, this is a simple bassline.,
Experiment with rhythms to get a groove going.

,
Take the other notes in the chord or tones close to the original note and play those once in a while.,
Let the bassline complement the other parts.,
Find out what chords your guitarist is playing.

,
Repeat those notes in time with the guitar.,
Using the notes you were already playing as a base, add different notes to create a melody.,
Take on board constructive criticism from your bandmates.",How to Compose a Good Bassline," Also, the melody is useful to devise the bassline. Until adequate experience is acquired, this should always be the first step!;
,, From this point, a punk bassline is almost automatically made by playing repetitively on these notes. To ensure a more interesting line though, it is first useful to smooth out the bassline.

, Don't be afraid to invert the chords, or change what note in the chord is on the bottom, to make the line smooth.

, See if it sounds independent of the bassline. Try to use contrary motion, such as when the melody goes up, then the bass goes down and vice versa.

, This may do for some, but the more creative will want to embellish.

,, Be sure to focus on the main note though.

, If this has a riff, the bass would love to have its turn with it. Just don't make it a carbon copy of another part, or else the bassline should take the bus home!

,, Keep experimenting until you are comfortable.

, Keep experimenting until you find something that sounds good.

, It's very important that you work together and put in equal amounts of effort.

You don't need to go that far, nor do you need any particular brand or style of computer. Producers use PCs and Macs, laptops and desktops, cheap and expensive.


If you want a Mac, make sure it has:

1.8 GHz, with an Intel Processor
2-4 GB of RAM
OSX 10.5 or later


If you want a PC, make sure it has:

2GHz Pentium or Celeron processor
2-4 GB of RAM
Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7
a sound card with ASIO driver support

;
, This is what you'll use to prepare individual tracks, load samples, sequence beats, mix, and record all the other components of your dubstep jams. As with hardware, dubstep producers will have a variety of different set-ups and opinions when it comes to software, but the bottom line is that you can make dubstep music on any computer, using any production software. Production software can range anywhere from free (GarageBand) to several hundred dollars (Ableton Live). Remember: you're only limited by your creativity. Get something you can afford and that will help you get your foot in the door. Popular software packages for recording dubstep include:


Fruity Loops
Renoise
Ableton Live
Cakewalk Sonar
GarageBand

, To get started, all you really need is the software, but as you start creating beats you can really round out your dubstep sound by adding a few basic hardware elements into your setup.


Having a basic USB mic on hand to record vocals or raps is a good idea and good way to create new sounds to use. If you're at all interested in incorporating original found sounds or acoustic elements and manipulating them in your dubstep music, a solid microphone is a good idea.
It won't take long messing around with the on-screen keyboard in GarageBand before you're ready to use a real MIDI keyboard. The Axiom 25 is a popular model that allows you to pitch bend, and it taps directly into Ableton's system. It's a solid addition to any dubstep setup.

, Producers in the EDM and dubstep community will occasionally package their own all-in-one packages to get started, including software and a store of samples and beat loops that you can build tracks from.It can be difficult to start making music when you're just struggling to figure out the software at first, so investing in one of these packs can cut down on the learning curve and get you making music quickly.


Most of these packages are only $200-300, making them fairly affordable and a good way to determine if producing dubstep is right for you and something you might want to invest more time and money into.

, If you're going to start making dubstep music, do your research. Learn the history and the techniques of the genre and immerse yourself in the vibrant culture of Electronic Dance Music. You need to know more about dubstep than the name Skrillex and that there is something called ""the drop.""


Check out the Box of Dub compilation and other mixes with various artists like Five Years of Hyperdub, Soundboy Punishments, and other collections of artists making challenging and high-quality dubstep. Listen closely and try to pick apart the sounds. Figure out what it is that stands out, what it is you like about certain songs and what you dislike about others.
Listen to Burial, Scuba, and Scream.

, In the beginning, worry less about finally getting your dubstep opus recorded, the one that you've had bumping around your mind for years. Instead, throw your efforts into playing around with the software and getting familiar with its particularities. Mess around and make joke tracks, record extreme or weird kinds of sounds you wouldn't normally want to listen to. Time spent learning the software will help you down the road when you want to translate something you hear in your head onto the computer. It's an instrument, so learn to play it.


Whatever software package you choose to download and install, take the tour of the software or check out guide videos on YouTube to learn everything you can about it. Hook up with experienced dubstep producers who are willing to show you the ropes and teach you about the software and how to use it.

, Samples can be found with a quick Internet search, your own field recording sessions, or you can spend money and invest in a few sample libraries for a wealth of high-quality sounds to play with. Organize them into categories you'll be able to remember and start making music with song fragments that catch your ear.


Consider getting an external hard drive on which to keep your samples. Organize them into practical categories like ""acoustic drums"" ""spoken word"" and ""synth sounds"" or by textural descriptions to keep things interesting. Maybe label your categories ""spacey"" or ""gnarly"" to start combining interesting textures with your samples when you make music.
Go old school and start crate-digging for used vinyl and convert your analog samples to digital. Seek out old songs that you've always loved and sample the hook from them.

, Typically, you'll set the tempo when you start a new track and the software will manipulate any preset beats or other effects to match the intended tempo of the song you're working on. If you're working with your own samples, though, this won't work, so it helps to get familiar with the way creating a beat works.


Beat tracks are made by organizing some combination of kick, snare, and hi-hat sounds into a base rhythm from which you'll build. Choose a kick sample and boost the bass and punch, or layer 3 different kick samples together to get that distinctive Dubstep kick sound.
Dubstep tempos generally hover around 140 bpm. You don't have to stick to that, but dubstep songs don't generally fall below 120 or 130.

, One of the most distinctive elements of dubstep music is the iconic wobbly bass tone, which is typically recorded using a MIDI keyboard or synth and composing a simple bassline yourself. Many free synths can be found online, or you can invest in a professional synth package like Native Instrument's Massive or Rob Papen's Albino 3.


Wobbles usually take a little tweaking and synth understanding to get right, but most synths come with pre-made ""patches"" which you can browse though and choose from.

, When you get more experienced, start double-tracking each wobble and adding other delays, distortions, and effects to create a collage tapestry that is a piece of electronic music.


Double track your wobbles into the top end and the clean subs at the bottom. When you start distorting and running the top end through a whole bunch of effects to dirty it up, it muds up the bottom end if it's not separated.
Take your bass patch, copy the entire track with the synth on it, and then on the copy, use only one oscillator and change it to a sine wave. Then high pass the top end using an equalizer (at around 70 Hz) and low pass the sub (at around 78 Hz).
Get some variations in your bass sounds by bouncing your samples to audio, tweaking the synth a little bit, and bouncing it back. Do it a few times, and you've got a library of bass wobbles that all follow the same bassline. You can further expand on this idea by running them all through different effects chains.

, Start with the beat. Many dubstep tracks start with a very subtle beat, incorporating a few simple drum sounds and gradually and steadily building up until the beat drops. After the pause, the main melody, bassline, and beat come in.


Choose a snare sample or layer 3 together to get a big and deep sound. Also search out any other percussion sounds you'd like in the beat.
The typical bass, snare, cymbals, toms, and cowbell will suffice, or you can create a completely unique beat by choosing less obvious samples. Try a gun shot, a stadium foot stomp, a clap, a car sound. Dubstep percussion has a lot of presence to it so feel free to mess with reverb and effects on the samples. Now program that beat!

, You can most likely use the same synth to create your melody sound or sample. Either browse the pre-made patches or start tweaking to get the sound you're thinking of.


Hum it out before you start recording. Figure out the notes using your piano, keyboard, guitar, or any other instrument you'd like to write music on and record the idea.
While dubstep doesn't layer sounds to the extent of some other genres, it may be a good idea to add extra layers over your melody. Even if they mimic other patterns very closely, you will be able to add layers as you get closer to the drop, creating excitement.

, A must-do in any attempt at a classic dubstep track is what is affectionately known as the ""drop."" At the climax, break the song down to just the beat, some tweaked-out wobbles, and effects. Go wild. This is basically a digital, machine-like guitar solo that gets people on the dance floor going crazy.


Build up to the drop and play tricks on people by dropping it in an unexpected place or by adding an extra beat here or an extra wobble there. One of the cool things about dubstep is keeping the beat kind of loose and unexpected. It stays on beat but never lands in the same place every time, keeping the beat evolving and exciting.

, Recreate what you hear in your head. Sometimes what you stumble upon while trying to recreate what you hear in your head can actually be better, so feel free to run with it if it sounds good, even if it wasn't your original idea. If the idea was that great, it'll come back to you.

, Have a professional mix the track (it's well worth the dough) or go the quick and easy route - add a maximizer to compress and boost all the levels. You'll achieve a more radio-friendly volume.

There are standard layouts of these parts that are used in most songs, however, so in order to understand how most songs sound, you'll need to understand the parts. They include:


An Introduction - this is the section at the beginning which leads into the song. Sometimes it might sound different from the rest of the song, might be faster or slower, or it might not exist at all. Many songs do not have an introduction, so don't feel like you have to use it.
A Verse - This is the main part of the song. It is usually fifty percent to twice the number of lines as the chorus but it does not have to be. What gives away a section of a song as a verse is that the melody is the same but the lyrics are different between the different verses.
A Chorus - The chorus is the part of the song that repeats without changing: both the lyrics and melody are unchanged or nearly unchanged. This is usually where you try to fit the catchiest part of your song (usually called the hook).
A Bridge - The bridge is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song. It is usually short, just a line or two of lyrics, and will sometimes lead into a key change.;
, The AABA structure is probably the most common structure of a song in modern popular music. In the study of song structures, A usually signifies a verse and B usually signifies a chorus. In other words, in this structure there are two verses, a chorus, and then a final verse. Experiment with this basic structure before moving on to more complex ones.

, There are of course, many different standard song structures. You can try AABB, ABA, AAAA, ABCBA, ABABCB, ABACABA, and so on.


C usually signifies a bridge, other letters that you see cited elsewhere likely just mean that that section of the song is none of the traditional parts and is unique to itself (sort of like taking a verse from a different song and putting it in).

, Of course, if you want to challenge your skills, you can try to write something that breaks from traditional forms and does not follow a standard structure. This can be very challenging though and is not the best way to get started.

, Stream of consciousness writing is where you just write and keep writing and don't stop: just write everything that comes into your head. This will capture many ideas that change quickly but it can help you find ideas when you're really lost.

, Look at songs which are known for great lyrics to get inspiration. You can learn a lot from thinking about what makes a song good vs what makes a song bad. Look for the kinds of things they talk about, how they talk about them, what rhymes they use, the rhythm of the lyrics, etc.

, Previously, this step advised what constituted good lyrics and what indicated bad ones, but it's really up to you what kind of music you want to write. You, whether you believe it or not, are a growing artist, and as an artist, you can use your own path and formulate your own opinions of various fellow artists and their work. So, if you want to write something similar to rocker Avril Lavigne rather than classic Frank Sinatra, don't let someone tell you you can't write how you want to.

, If you're hard up for inspiration but you want to keep practicing your song writing, try adapting existing poems. Older poems (think Lord Byron or Robert Burns) have wonderful ideas but might not seem all that modern. Take on the challenge and adapt them. Can you make a rap song out of Shakespeare? A folk song from E. E. Cummings? This type of challenge will improve your skills and give you a great starting point.

, Don't ever look at how others write songs and feel like you have to do the same; everyone has a different style. Some write freely from their mind's eye, while others write with a specific intention. While there are lots of rules and conventions to music, at the end of the day it is a creative venture, which means that the most important thing is that it expresses you.

, Get a journal and be ready to write down a lot of stuff that won't work in order to get to the stuff that does. This is how the creative process works: everyone has to make bad things on the way to making good things. Write as much as you can until you feel it is finished or ready to be set aside. To even write a single word or sound is an excellent start. Let the song ferment. Songwriting takes time!


Keep everything. If you write a single sentence of a song down, it always leads to something else sooner.

, You should always start by just writing. Write about your feelings. Write about the world around you. Describe a person or a thing that matters to you. This is to help you find the words most worthy of a song. The poetry on which your song will be built (whether it's an actual poem or just a few phrases that you want to cobble together into something better). Remember: it doesn't have to always be depressing or angry. Or even have an emotion. A laundry list could be poetic if done right.

, ""I'm so sad, I just feel bad, my girlfriend left me today...""....No. Don't do this. This is a fast way to make your song forgettable. The best lyrics, like any good writing, get us to feel emotions because they capture that experience, not because they tell us what to feel. Try to write about what it's like to feel something, instead of just telling your audience.


A good example of an alternative to this ""I'm so sad"" thing is from Damien Rice's song The Animals Were Gone: ""At night I dream without you, and hope I don't wake up; 'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cup"".
Brainstorm some ideas so you can see what you have and choose or even build off of an existing idea. It is probably best if you have an inspiration.

, You know when you see a song written by someone who isn't very good and the lyrics just come off as cheesy? This is often because they rhyme too much or very badly. You should avoid having all of your lines rhyme, and the rhymes that you do use should look natural. Don't put weird phrases or words into your lyrics just to get a rhyme. Really, your lyrics don't have to rhyme at all. Plenty of songs have non-rhyming lyrics.


Good: ""You make me feel real again/You just have to smile and I know/The sun's coming out - Amen!""
Bad: ""I really love my cat/My cat is where it's at/Her tail looks like a bat/She's getting kind of fat...""
Of course, there are some genre considerations. Rap often has far more rhyming than other genres, but even then it's not required. It's just stylistic.

, If you do want to make your rhyming stand out a bit more and avoid sounding cheesy, you can experiment with different styles of rhyming. Did you know that there's more ways to rhyme than just what you learned in school? Explore assonance/consonance rhymes, pararhyme, alliteration, forced rhymes, etc.


For example, Macklemore's Same Love uses many examples of assonance rhymes and other non-standard rhymes: lately/daily, anointed/poisoned, important/support it, etc.

, You want to avoid cliches because these keep your songs from standing out and don't show off your unique talent. If you have someone down on their knees (especially if they're begging please), someone is walking down the street (either it's a girl or it's you, either way, it's been done), or you just have to ask ""why can't you see"", you probably need to go back to the drawing board.

, You probably remember hearing about the conservation of matter in your science classes (the idea that nothing is destroyed completely). Well, the same rule generally applies to music. Learn about how music notation works (bars, measures, notes, rests, etc) so that you can make sure your lyrics fit in with the music. The short version of the advice is that you should make sure your lines have roughly even syllables and that your rhythm stays steady (don't speed up too much to fit in extra words).


Think of a section of music as being like four cups of water. Now, you can pour half of one of the cups into a fifth cup, but that now means that you have two half-full cups. The first doesn't get any more water in it. You similarly can't add extra beats without making it up somewhere (usually with a pause).

, When you first start songwriting, if you're doing it on your own it's best to start with a melody already written. This is easier for most people than trying to create a melody which matches existing lyrics. You can write your own melody, work with a musically gifted friend, or you can adapt a classical melody, such as from old folk songs (just be sure to use songs in the public domain).

, Not everyone has Mariah Carey's vocal range. When you come up with a melody, keep the notes within a reasonable range so that someone can actually sing it.

, Singers are human too and they need to breathe. Put an extra two to four beats here and there that allow the singer to stop for a second to catch their breath. This also gives the listener a chance to take in what you are saying. A good example of this is the the USA's national anthem, after the line ""For the land of the free"". There is a pause before ""And the home of the brave"", which allows the singer to recover from the very powerful previous few bars.

, What is the bigger picture? Does the song form a narrative, a declaration, or a description? Is it a call to action, a set of directions, or a greeting? Is it philosophy or a reflection? Is it genuinely nonsensical? Does it have multiple forms? Start moving around words and changing them so they fit in with the rest of the lyrics. Think about how you want to come across and how that balances with what you want to say. Do you like the placement of the vowel and consonant sounds? Does a line have multiple meanings? Does a particular phrase stand out? Do you want to repeat a line or word? Remember, the first time an audience hears a song, they only hear the parts that stand out the most.

, Who says you can't change what you have written? If you like the original, then keep it. But most lyricists need to play with the song a bit to get that perfect sound. A good song can be written in one draft, but more often it takes a while. Even move around entire verses so the song has continuity. Sometimes, a song takes on a whole new meaning.

, Once you're done with your song, it can be a really good idea to share a test version with others. Even if they're just reading your lyrics, they may be able to find places where the rhythm is off or where the rhymes sound strange. Of course, music by committee is a bad idea but if they catch something and you agree it's wrong, fix it!

, We make the world a better place when we share the things that we create. It's okay to be shy and just because you wrote a song doesn't mean that you have to go out and do a concert. But you should write it down or record it in such a way that you can share it with others. Don't hide your incredible work!

, If you've written your lyrics but you've never written a song before, you might want to get some help learning how to compose a song. It is not actually all that different from writing lyrics: there are also standards and guides that you can use as a basis to work from.

, Although it isn't strictly necessary, having a basic understanding for how music works will significantly increase your ability to write good songs. You might even be able to write them down for others to play!

, Being a better singer will be help you figure out what notes you're looking for when writing your music. Work on those vocal skills and you'll be surprised how much it can help.

, Knowing some basics about how to play standard instruments can help a lot with songwriting. Consider learning how to play the piano or how to play the guitar. Both can be self-taught and are not too complicated.

Listen to music on the radio.,
Read up about music in music magazines to catch up with the times.,
Don't limit yourself to one genre - embrace all types of pop music.,
Think about the music.,
Choose a decade and learn it well, then choose another.,
Get involved in your local music scene.,
Learn to play an instrument, and play along.,
Enjoy the music and help others get excited about it, too.",How to Be Knowledgeable About Pop Music," When you're in the car, choose several stations and program them into your quick-tune buttons. Listen every time you get into the car, to whichever station cranks your fancy that day. You don't need to listen to the same music all the time - you need to listen to a lot of different music so that it becomes familiar to you, and you become used to hearing music in different varieties.;
, Reading articles in nationally famous newspapers like the NY Times or the LA Times by well known and respected music critics, and checking out opinion pieces by other music journalists in publications like Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly can give you insights into current and up-and-coming bands and recording artists.

, As mentioned earlier, Pop music is just another way of saying it's popular. It's not just about your own musical taste - of course you will like some types of music more than other types. But to be truly knowledgeable, you need to open yourself to all sorts of music.

, Listen actively. When you listen to pop music, think about what genre it fits into. Is this a folk song, a rock song, a pure pop tune? Is it a light jazz tune? Is it a country tune? Is it melancholy? Is it up-tempo? Where might this music be most popular?

, Even though pop music really has its origins in early America, starting way back with the influence of slave spirituals and folk songs, it's hard to study those in much detail because of scarcity of material. Instead, it's recommended that you start with the 1930s, when pop music really began to come into its own as a genre (due in large part to the invention of the affordable record player). Going back to the 1920s, there will be some examples of songs that could fit into more modern pop categories, but they will be sparse. Listen to the big band sounds of the 1930s, hear the different vocal styles, and contrast how different singing styles are from the early part of the decade into the later part. When you feel like you're getting pretty familiar with the 1930s, spend another week, then move on to the 1940s, and so on.

, Go out and see local bands. Figuring out which types of bands you enjoy most can give you some great experiences and turn you and your friends on to some cool music and musicians that just aren't big enough (yet) to have burst into the national awareness. You get to see a potentially great, world class band in a small, intimate setting, before they hit the big time. For example: Back in the 70's and 80's, crowds of Los Angelenos flocked to clubs like the Troubadour, Madame Wong's and Club 88 to see the local bands who were creating a buzz around town with their great music and performances. Some of those bands turned out to be The Police, Elton John, The Go-Gos, and The Blasters. In New York, CBGBs and other local haunts were the regular places to see bands like Talking Heads, the Sex Pistols, and The Ramones. These clubs were small, holding audiences of only a few hundred people. You can get up close and personal, take pictures a lot of times, if you want, and be totally cutting edge in your local music scene.

, If you really want an immersible experience, learn to play a pop instrument. Obviously, you will not enjoy pop music sing-alongs as much with a violin or clarinet as with a piano or guitar, but hey, whatever floats your boat. Guitar and piano (or keyboard) are fun, because they leave you free to sing along. Learning pop tunes and playing along help you recognize different forms and musical structures, and identify similarities in the varying types of pop music.

, Sharing your musical knowledge with others can turn them on to the same enjoyment you feel when you listen to pop music. Plus, it's a great ice-breaker at parties to know something about music.

Determine your budget.,
Select the right type of cartridge for your tonearm's mount.,
Choose between a ""moving magnet"" and a ""moving coil"" cartridge.,
Compare the stylus shapes of different cartridges.",How to Choose a Phono Cartridge," The phono-cartridge is a single piece of a much larger stereo system, and the budget allocated to the cartridge should reflect the total cost of the whole system. Entry-level audiophile cartridges retail around 30 U.S. dollars, with incredibly high-end models reaching over $3000. A good budget might start with allocating about 10 percent of your total expenditure towards the cartridge.;
, Your turntable's tonearm will fall into 1 of 4 categories, and you must buy a cartridge that is compatible with the mount type.


The half-inch or ""standard"" mount is by far the most common. This type of mount has a large, flat ""headshell"" under which the cartridge sits. The cartridge is secured by 2 screws located 1/2 inch (12 mm) apart.
The ""P"" mount is common is some low-end turntables. The rear end of the cartridge plugs into the tonearm and is secured with a single screw.
A convertible mount, while uncommon, can be adapted to fit either half-inch or ""P"" mount cartridges.
Integrated mounts use proprietary cartridges that cannot be swapped out for other models. This type of mount is occasionally found on DJ turntables.

, All modern phono-cartridges are magnetic - they consist of a magnet and a small metal coil that move in relation to each other to produce an electrical signal.


The most common design is called a moving magnet cartridge - the magnet is allowed to move while the coil is fixed. This type of cartridge is available from low-end models to very high-end ones.
Moving coil cartridges (where the magnet is fixed and the coil moves) are preferred by some audio enthusiasts, purportedly for their superior sound. These cartridges are typically only available in very high-end, expensive models. To use a moving coil cartridge, your amplifier must have a separate input labeled ""MC"" or you must purchase a separate step-up transformer (or circuit) made specifically for this purpose.

, The stylus is the needle that actually touches the vinyl record. All modern styli are made from diamond, but they come in several different shapes and sizes. Inexpensive styli are often made in a spherical shape, which offers comparatively low sound quality - the exception being DJ cartridges where the spherical shape is necessary for ""back-cuing"" and ""scratching."" Elliptical styli offer greater area of contact (with the walls of the record groove) and they therefore require less ""tracking force"" - (the amount of weight being placed on the stylus) - to retrieve the recorded information, resulting in less record wear and higher fidelity. There are also elliptical styli available for audiophile DJs, but scratching is not recommended with these. ""Biradial"", ""micro line"" or ""linear contact"" styli are more difficult to manufacture than ellipticals or sphericals and will be more expensive, but will require even less tracking force while producing even higher fidelity results.

Copyright your song.",How to Write a Song As a Gift," You might already know who you want to write your song for, but if you don’t, spend some time thinking about the people who are important to you. Do you have a partner, a best friend, or a parent? Is there a teacher or coach who inspires you? Is there someone you have a crush on? You can write a song for anybody, but it will be easier if you have strong feelings about them., Your country-music-fan mom probably won’t appreciate a rap song as much as your boyfriend who listens to hip-hop all day. You don’t have to write your song in a style you don’t like or don’t know much about, but writing it in a genre your recipient likes is a good way to make sure they like your song!, Writing a song will be much easier if you know what you want to say to them. You don’t have to start writing lyrics right away, but take a few minutes to write down your favorite things about them, how they make you feel, and why you want to write them a song., You can just sing your song a cappella if you want, but if you want to include instruments, choose which ones you’ll use before you start writing. If you plan to use multiple instruments, you’ll need to either find other musicians to play with or make sure you have access to recording software that can layer each instrument together.

, Most pop songs have three different verses, each followed by a chorus that is usually louder and faster, and usually remains the same throughout the song. You can also include a bridge, which is a section between the verse and the chorus to make the transition sound better. If you want your song to be longer or more complex, you can include a middle 8, which can be a different set of lyrics or even a music solo. Remember, your song structure is entirely up to you!, Writing a melody first is the best way to write a song--it’s much easier to write lyrics to fit a melody than the opposite. What kind of melody you write depends on your preferences, but there are some general tips.Repetition is important, but don’t be too repetitive! Your melody should regularly repeat the same sounds to give the song some structure, but don’t overdo it--too much repetition can be annoying.
Up-and-down melodies tend to be very pleasing. Don’t just make your song go up in tone, bring it down and then up again.
Make sure your melody flows. If you want to go from a very low note to a very high note, put a few medium-tone notes in between--jumping around can make your melody sound jarring.

, The chorus should be short--about four lines or chords is a good guideline. It should be catchy and memorable, so keep it simple and fun. If you aren’t sure what to write in the chorus, think of the most important things you want to say--that’s where they belong., Your verses lead up to and support your chorus. They can be longer, have more detail, and be more personal than the chorus. For example, if your chorus is about how you wish your crush would notice you, write verses that talk about why you like them and how being apart from them makes you feel.

A good rule of thumb is that a verse should be about twice as long as your chorus.

, Don’t expect to write the perfect song on your first try. It’s okay to write several drafts of a song--in fact, it will make your song even better!, Don’t immediately get up from writing and play your finished song at your recipient’s party. Practice it a few times on your own so you know it well. This is especially important if you plan to perform it live!, Let someone else hear the song before the person you wrote it for. If your song would hurt or embarrass the recipient, is inadvertently copied from a popular song, or needs some more work, it’s best to find out before showing it to everyone., If you want, you can perform your song live for the person you wrote it for. If you do this, try to make it special--wear something that adds to your performance, and make sure you’ve practiced first!

, If you want to make a recording of your song, you have several options.Have someone take a video of you performing. If you do this, make sure they have a high-quality camera--a cell phone won’t look or sound as good.
Use recording software at home. You can buy a program or use a free online-based recording site.
Go to a professional studio. You can hire a pro to record your song too--smaller record labels often rent studio time, and some areas even have walk-in studios.

, You can send a music file or a link to a streaming song, or give a physical copy like a CD, cassette, or record. The format you choose will determine the process for finalizing it--sending a file can be done very quickly, but pressing a vinyl record may take a few weeks.

, Make sure your recording is high quality before you give it as a gift. Check for static, skipping, cut off lyrics, or poor sound quality. Make sure you listen to the entire recording--there might be a mistake at the very end! If you’re giving a CD, make sure it’s compatible with car and computer stereos., If you are sending them a file or posting it to a website, write a message about how much they mean to you. If it’s for a specific event, like a birthday, send your best wishes. If you’re giving a physical recording, like a CD or a vinyl record, design a nice cover or label for it., In the United States and many other countries, the writer of a song automatically has a copyright. But if you want, you can take the extra step of formally registering your song by contacting your country’s copyright office in person, via mail, or online."

Enjoy it!",How to Build a Loyal Fanbase for Your Music," This is a fairly obvious one. Make sure your 'product' (in this instance, your song/EP/album etc.) is up to scratch. It should sound professional and unique.;
, This doesn't always resonate with many unsigned artists, but it is so vital. First of all, a site. This should be the hub from where everything to do with you and your music can be accessed by the public. This includes photos, videos, links to social network platforms, updates, upcoming performances, reviews, biography, press releases, contact information (for agent and promoter) etc. Next is social networking, over the past decade or so, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and sites like that.

, Spam is glaringly noticeable in your email and news feeds and is immediately deleted or hidden. For this, adopt the mindset of a fan, if you saw that an unsigned musician, who is yet to prove themselves in the industry, send you an email with a miasma of different links, exclamation marks everywhere and an off-putting desperation would surely make you think ""how unprofessional"", ""they clearly don't know what they're doing"" etc. This is why spam never works. There's only one thing that is worse. When you do it more than once. That way you can guarantee being forever placed in the spam folder, which means, one less fan.

, This is a step which needs patience, but the results can be incredible. If you start a blog referencing your own personal experiences in the industry, or giving tips to other unsigned artists etc. People will begin to take interest in you and your music, it's subtle, yet effective. The polar opposite of spam. If you grab people's attention through as many means as possible, but maintain a professional, indirect delivery, the interest will be a gradual journey to finding out about your music, becoming a fan and paying for your gigs and records.

, Turn into the fan. Show an interest in your potential fans, get to know them, what they like and what they listen to, as this can tell you a lot about whether they are a prospective fan. Once a connection has been established, introduce them to your music, tell them about your experiences, share your story. Fans do not want to have music thrown at them, they want to know about the artist and create a complete idea of who they are listening to, this makes your music more relatable and your entire brand just gels together smoothly. It's how a new music experience should be.

, This is for the artists who want to solely focus on their music and leave the business side of it to, well, the business people. This will cost you, but the results are worth it. The companies that do these things are experts and you will have guaranteed results in a much shorter time period than if you did it alone. Companies exist that offer multiple advertisement and promotion options as well, which can give the artist more control over both the business and creative aspects of their career, without having to spend hours and hours promoting themselves.

, Enjoy the journey, the struggle, enjoy getting to know your fans and put your heart and soul into your music and your fans. They are the ones that can make you or break you, appreciate them and be friends with them.

Let them play in the background while you browse the Web, answer e-mails, etc. If you hear a song you like, write down the title, album, and artist, if possible. Some good sites include: pandora.com, accuradio.com jango.com, last.fm and deezer.com, but there are plenty of other great ones.;
, Type in the name of a band or song that struck you and listen to samples of all their albums and songs. Check out related artists (often mentioned in editorial reviews and the recommendation section) too. Find out what music genre the song or musician(s) you're interested in fall into, and shop by genre.

, You know that guy on the bus who wears a trench coat, eyeliner, and fingerless gloves? Yeah, he may have some interesting turns playing. Look at the kid with the lip ring and the bag of art supplies. Next time you see him bobbing his head to his iPod, ask him what he's listening to. Either he'll think you're rude, or, more likely, he'll be delighted at the chance to share his musical taste with someone who's actually curious. Instead of asking people how they're enjoying (or not) the weather, ask them questions like:


What's the first CD you bought?






What's the last CD you bought?






If you had to choose one song to summarize your life, what would it be?






Has a song ever made you cry?






If you were to make a soundtrack to your life, what would be on it?







, Often, an artist or group puts out one or two singles that engage popular appeal but are uncharacteristic of their work. And quite commonly, the jewels of music are buried in albums, far away from radio play. So, if a catchy single drew you in, don't be surprised and throw the CD away if the rest of the songs aren't just like it.

, It's best to listen to an album three times before you make your judgment, especially if it's a genre you don't normally listen to. For example, if you're listening to your first heavy metal CD, you'll probably spend the first run furrowing your eyebrows as your ears adjust. By the second run, you might start to feel your toes tap, and a little bit of headbanging coming on. And by the third time around, you could very well be singing along and listening carefully to the lyrics. You don't necessarily have to listen to an album three times in a row--just make sure you've given it the full benefit of the doubt before you toss it.

, Find out who the local bands are and where they play. Visit venues that feature independent artists. If you live near a major city, find out where you can listen to great music live and go there. Even if it's a group or performer you've never heard of, and/or a type of music you don't normally like, sometimes listening to music live can make a believer out of you and change your listening perspective.

, You can better appreciate music by understanding how it works. Music has many layers, which are difficult to recognize and enjoy without knowing what the difference is between music and noise. In other words, listening to music without understanding music theory is like being into cars without having any idea what's under the hood.

, What better way to further your appreciation for musical artists and the work they create than by learning to create it yourself? Cover your favorite songs. If you're drawn to certain songs and genres because of the emotion it stirs in you, chances are, that emotion will be amplified if you genuinely try to play that music yourself. And who knows? You might discover your inner musician and start creating music of your own.

, The library is a wonderful repository of wealth. Think of it like this: what's theirs is yours!. Besides all the books there, libraries also stock music--all kinds of music: rap, country and western (both the modern and the old), blues, classical, opera, world music, reggae, techno, minimalism, trance, disco, etc.). Whatever your library doesn't have, they can order from other libraries.

, Then, explore some of the music they listen to that doesn't fit the niche you've carved for yourself. Give it a chance even if it takes you out of your musical comfort zone a bit (see previous note on listening to an album more than once). When you listen with an open mind as opposed to with your prejudgment, you'll often be surprised at what you actually do enjoy! Ask your friend for recommendations they think you'd enjoy but that you normally wouldn't listen to.

, Identify a few artists you consistently enjoy, and find their collaborations. Next, check out compilation albums that have included the artist, and listen for other artists on the compilation album you might enjoy. Similarly, find soundtracks which feature their music- both approaches, you're likely to discover artists with musical styles similar to your ""always-in-your-CD-player"" artist.

Nah, you need your own sound. So spend as much time as possible listening to different sub-genres: ghettotech, Chicano rap, East Coast hip hop, low bap, mafioso, you name it. Become an expert. You're also checking out the competition!


Study all of hip-hop, from the beginning to the end. If you don't know many emcees, here's a few classic rappers everyone should know: Run DMC, Beastie Boys, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Wu-Tang Clan, NWA, Public Enemy, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 5, A Tribe Called Quest, Common, KRS-ONE. Eventually you'll be a true hip-hop ""head."";
, No one would put Ghostface Killah, DMX, and Eminem in the same category. Every artist has their schtick. They make similar music, but they twist it in very different ways. In general, here are your categories:



Hustler rappers. Their music is mainly about selling drugs, CDs, or however it is they're making ends meet. Similar to glamour rappers who brag about fast cars, money, jewelry, and women. It's highly materialistic content. Not hard to find these as they're the most common.

Conscience rappers. Sometimes referred to as a ""backpacker rapper."" This type of music focuses on more higher-minded things -- namely social or political issues, family, the concept behind drugs and the larger meaning of it all. A little philosophical -- a la Mos Def or Dead Prez.

Storyteller rappers. They're just that -- storytellers. Generally it's about them or their opponent, but the topic can obviously vary. Think Raekwon and Nas.

Political rappers. They're similar to conscience rappers, but they concentrate on the pitfalls of society and are usually blatantly anti-establishment. Public Enemy or even Macklemore.

Tongue twisters. Can rap at double the speed of normal rap (generally in 8/4 time). Similar to the ""pure lyricist,"" who concentrates on difficult beat and rhyme patterns, large words, and burning their opponent over and over and over. Look to Busta or Twisted Insane for good examples.

, Freestyling comes with time. For right now, grab that pen and paper and let your mind go. You can wax later. Think of any topic -- the couch you're sitting on, the second-hand backpack you were forced to use for years, your hatred of Jimmy Kimmel, whatever. And then start streaming those gems.


The easiest way to get started is to think of the ends first. You can use a rhyming dictionary if you like, but you'll have to rely on your own brain eventually. If you've got your first line (""Jimmy Kimmel, man, that time slot's just a waste of space""), come up with a list of words that rhyme with the last word (face, race, brace, case, trace). Where can you go from there?
No one wants to hear rhymes that have been lifted from someone else. Don't be the Dane Cook of MCs. Even if your rhymes sound more like Dr. Seuss than Dr. Dre, if they're yours, they're better than if they're stolen.

, Simply put, the more words you know, the more words you know that rhyme. And if you can drop a word that your opponent doesn't recognize, boom. Served (cue mic drop). So bust out that rhyming dictionary (there are a bunch online) and get to acquainting yourself with your own language. Your words are your power. With more words at your disposal, you'll be less likely to get tripped up when you're in a cipher.


Work with near rhymes, too. She knew that I really didn't wanna go/but she convinced me it'd be magical. The ends don't rhyme, but they sort of do. A good rhyming dictionary will have near rhymes, too. Don't limit yourself to straight up, solid rhymes. There's ton of wiggle room. And if it's hilarious, no one will really care.

, Study rhyme pattern. It is crucial to the development of your unique voice that you develop your own flow-style. One beat could have a dozen ways to stream along it. When you hear a loop, how many ways can you imagine spitting to it?


Listen very carefully to rappers like Raekwon, Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie, Big Pun, any MC you can think of that has established a new and unique flow. Studying and learning about flow-techniques is learning mathematics in a way: you need to understand the rhythm, the beat, its structure, counting bars, where the groove comes from, where to place your rhymes and so forth.

, Now you've got a few rhymes of your own you can experiment with -- so get started! Pull up some instrumental beats on YouTube and go. Use the same rhymes and try finding different rhythms to incorporate. What comes naturally and what doesn't? What sounds too repetitive and needs to be spiced up?


Sometimes your rhymes just won't fit a specific beat. If it's not working out, find a different track. Be patient -- it may take a while to find the sound you're looking for.

, Ditch that pen and paper and start doing it off the cuff. The best MCs only need a few seconds to start dropping one-liners and biting rhymes. So get in your shower and start freestyling about how wonderful your soap is. Take any instance and work it. The goal is for someone to hand you any situation and you can run with it.


As you let yourself go -- and you need to truly let yourself go -- write down that line that you want to use for later reference. Not all of freestyling is truly 100% spontaneous. Most rappers have a store of end rhymes or lines that they can build new material off of to get started.

, Every rapper has been in the moment where they need a second to regroup. When that time rolls around, you rely on a filler. It's just a simple phrase that gets you back to the top of the beat and can start a new stream of thinking. It's best to have two or three you can rely on when that dreaded time rolls around.


Don't overthink it. Your filler could be something like, ""you know what I'm sayin'?"" or ""That's how I do."" Generally picking a phrase that ends in a common sound is best.

, You are not a WCW wrestler. Your music has to be genuine and real. The last thing you should be rapping about is your homies in Compton and how you need to powder your backhand when really you're sitting in Topeka, Kansas playing D&D by yourself. Stick to what you know, what you understand, and what you feel. Your music will be better and you'll get respect for it, regardless of what it is.


Freddie Gibbs got big rapping about Gary, Indiana. It's a perfect example of taking what you have and making it work. Because of that, his music is unique and undeniably creative (not to mention definitely his own). Your situation is not a burden. You just have to know how to spin it.

, There is always something that eats at your soul and is constantly waiting for you to expose it. Becoming a good MC is about finding yourself and expressing it. So who are you? What's your sound? How do you flow?


Though it has nothing to do with your skill and acting becoming an MC, it helps to have the look, so we'll mention it briefly here: have the look. Match your music. If you rap about bling, you best have bling. If you're rapping about how tough it is having so much swag, you best have superfluous amounts of swag. If and when you hit it big, you won't be scrambling for an image and be caught getting ""packaged.""

, A cipher (or cypher) is when two people rap back and forth, feeding off of each other and making a friendly competition out of it (it is not a battle). So grab a buddy and spend a couple minutes rapping back and forth. Practice is the only way you'll get truly good at freestyling.


There's a couple things to aim for in this situation: 1) take your opponent's look/skills and address them when your turn is up, 2) pick up where they left off -- if they say, ""Who do you think you are?"" you literally answer them back, and 3) take their same flow initially, and then run away with it, doing your own thing. It creates a more cohesive feel (all of these do, actually).

, Using your knowledge of current affairs, you can make apt, timely, cutting-edge similes and metaphors to give an edge to your rap battles and songs. Your words are your weapons, and you can use these to stop what is eating at you. And the crowd will go wild, too.


A story about your life is good; people may be able to understand and relate. But talking about a cultural-wide thing is something your entire audience can understand. They'll feel like they're in on the joke and get your message. So whether you're knocking Miley Cyrus or spitting your views on Obamacare, if it's relevant, it's good.

, Plenty of MCs surround themselves with like-minded, equally talented people for an explosion of hip-hop creativity. Imagine the Wu-Tang Clan as just the, well, Wu-Tang Man. Totally lacking. So get to collaborating!


It's a good idea to work with someone who has some serious DJing skills. They'll be able to back you up and give you the feel that you need -- if they know what they're doing, that is. It also probably means they have gear.
A hype-man or sidekick. Having someone else onstage that is full of verve and charisma that can chime in on your hooks or get the crowd going when you need a breather can make a huge difference when dealing with audiences.

, Take some of your best rhymes and get to recording yourself. Not only will you be creating something you can give to others or post online, you'll be able to hear how you sound, where your strengths lie and where you need work. If you're not happy with it, you simply rerecord it.


You could make a demo, but that'll come in time. Right now you need some basic recording software and equipment or, if you've the moolah, some studio time. You can do it with everything from your computer's sound recorder and an instrumental track to getting more hi-tech with programs and software. We won't get into all the options because wikiHow has an entire category devoted to music producing and recording.

, You're not just gonna put those recordings on your bookshelf and use them to lull yourself to sleep tonight, are you? Nope! Set up a Facebook page, Twitter, fancy Tumblr, Soundcloud and get going on generating attention. This is not a time to be modest -- right now you're selling yourself.


Did we mention YouTube? Definitely YouTube. Every platform you can imagine, put your name out there. When people wonder about you, all you have to do is hit 'em up with a link and they can start on getting addicted to your sound.

, Now you gotta bring your skills to the live table. You're not just singing to your Dove bar anymore, you're not just spitting with your friends -- you need veritable gigs where you rap battle -- or at least showcase your rhymes to people who have yet been graced by your innovative beats. You'll develop the public appeal you've been waiting for and start working on that cred.


Hit up club owners with your recording. If they're interested, they may offer you a night as a ""try-out."" If no venue in your area is looking for that kind of music, go to open mic nights! Just having people hear you is the goal.
Be confident, clear, articulate, and, above all, sober. You do not want to go into one of your first gigs under the influence of anything. Do a mic check beforehand, feel the vibe of the room, start bantering with the audience, and get into it. When you show you're into it, it allows the audience to get into it, too.

, If that's the end goal, of course. It'll be easiest to do this with an agent, so start asking around! They can start sending your demo to people looking for the next best thing. If you send it, it may just get sorted into the trash bin. So grab your demo, grab your agent, and get to turning this into your career.


Be patient -- sometimes these things take years. Keep dominating cyberspace and marketing yourself, too. You never know who will run across your talent and want a piece! Take whatever gigs you can until that fateful day when your agent calls and says you have a bite. The rest is history!

Look deeper.,
Listen to your local jazz station if you have one in your area or find one on the internet.,
Talk to friends who like jazz, and get their recommendations.

,
Take a jazz course offered through a local college.

,
Listen to a wide sampling of a particular jazz musician (including singers) before you make a judgement on whether you like them or not.",How to Build a Great Jazz Collection," The jazz CD getting the most current attention is not necessarily the one deserving it. Record companies buy product placement in movies, on commercials, and on posters in the local record store. So just because an artist is getting a lot of play in the newspapers, don't assume he's got the goods. Sometimes the best music fails to receive the plaudits it deserves.;
, One of the best stations streaming on the web is WBGO out of Newark, NJ. When you hear something you like and the station fails to identify it, email or phone them to find out what they played.

,,, Jazz improvisers may vary in their consistency many times, or they may experiment with different styles. For example, if you don't like one Billie Holiday song, don't dismiss her artistry until you've heard quite a few more. So much of the pleasure in jazz comes from experiencing an artist's musical trajectory during the course of his or her career.

Many metal fans claim to feel like outsiders in the regular world, but to feel welcome and happy in the metal community. If you make people feel unwelcome, chances are you’re the one who’ll end up getting shunned.;
, A lot of metal fans fit the stereotypical image of having long hair, wearing band shirts and baggy pants, and violently dancing to their favorite tunes, but just as many metal fans look like “regular” people.


If you’re a metalhead, chances are the music will inspire your personal style, but that doesn’t mean you have to look like a metalhead just to fit in with your community.

, True metalheads live their lives according to a philosophy taught by the music they love. This could vary depending on their favorite bands, but if you’re a metalhead, the music will be part of your moral fabric.

, Let metal inspire you to discover who you are as a person. Use the songs to explore your feelings and ideas. Let the music inform your decisions, but don’t let it make them for you.


A lot of the lyrics of metal songs can be violent and self-destructive, but that doesn’t mean you need to be. There’s often a deeper meaning, so seek it out before you make poor life choices.
As an example, the song “Suicide Solution” was once cited in a court case as causing a teenager to commit suicide, but the artist (Ozzy Osbourne) argued that the teenager had misinterpreted his lyrics., Many people claim that most metal is fantasy regardless the subgenre. This is because it explores reality through a lens that reaches beyond the things we see every day.


This might be more obvious with a band like Rhapsody, but fantasy (albeit horror fantasy) is also explored in Cannibal Corpse lyrics and album art., A lot of metalheads claim to be nerdy. Some regularly play role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. Some claim to be obsessed with video games and fantasy fiction. Others claim to be passionate about composing and producing music.Regardless of the genre, metal is generally quite intricate and complex music. It invites repeat listening and obsessive attention.

, Invest in high-quality sound equipment. Metal is complex music that is best heard on a sound system that can handle it. Try out your favorite songs on various stereo systems before deciding on what you like best.


In addition to purchasing a good sound system, you’ll also want to treat your records and CDs with care. If you have any rare recordings, be sure that you back them up., A lot of people have a fixed idea of metal but don't actually know what it’s about. Try not to get offended when they immediately assume you’re a Satanist or deranged in some way.


Metalheads are some of the most sensitive, happy, and friendly people you’ll meet. Don’t let a few ignorant people change that!

, Metalheads are no different from other types of fans in that they value trivia. If you haven’t already done so, read up on the history of metal. This will also help you discover new bands and figure out which subgenres of metal are your favorite.


A topic that often comes up in discussions of metal is “Who was the first metal band?” The most popular answer seems to be Black Sabbath, the first band to play “the Devil’s Chord”, but people also argue for Blue Cheer, Dennis Edmonton/Mars Bonfire, and Alice Cooper, among others., There are an overwhelming number of metal subgenres, and these will differ depending on who you talk to. Knowing the types of metal will help you explore your tastes and broaden your horizons.


Some subgenres include power metal, progressive metal, stoner metal, glam metal, thrash metal, stoner core, black metal, Norwegian black metal, Swedish death metal, goth metal, industrial metal, new wave American metal, folk metal, viking metal — the list goes on indefinitely., If you spend time in the metal community you’ll likely hear various labels for types of metal fans. Some labels include Hessians, Bangers, Metallians, and Death Rockers.It’s better to get to know a person than to base your opinion on a stereotype, but knowing what the labels mean can still broaden your knowledge of metal.

, For the most part this is common sense, but it becomes particularly important if you’re planning to be in the mosh pit — which is likely if you’re a metalhead. If you’re going to be in the mosh pit, here are some considerations:


Wear sturdy shoes and clothes. Don’t wear anything that can be easily wrecked. Don’t wear anything that is super important to you, which you’d be sad to lose or have destroyed.
Minimize. Only wear and bring what you absolutely need. If you can avoid it, don’t wear glasses. If you have a wallet and keys, attach them with a chain or leave them with a friend who isn’t going to be in the mosh pit. Leave the phone at home if possible. This isn’t just for your safety; it’s for the safety of others too, who could be hit by your flying items.

, Also called the horned hand or the Mano Cornuto, this hand gesture was made popular by the famous metal vocalist, Ronnie James Dio. It involves making a fist with your hand, but leaving your pointer and pinky fingers pointing upwards.When doing devil horns, make sure your thumbs aren’t sticking out.

, If you want to look like a stereotypical metalhead, you’ll need to rock metal shirts. If you wear a tour shirt, make sure that it’s from a show you’ve actually been to. Many fans look down on wearing shirts from tours you haven’t actually attended.


It’s kind of immature, but a lot of metal fans look down on wearing shirts of the bands whose concerts you are at. For instance, you wouldn’t wear an Arch Enemy shirt to an Arch Enemy concert.

, Denim vests and leather jackets covered in patches are popular in the metal community. If this is part of your style, be sure to buy and sew on the patches yourself. Pre-patched clothes are looked down upon.

, Boots are another popular item worn by metalheads. If you go to a lot of shows (and if you’re a true metalhead, you probably do), you might want to invest in a pair of steel-toed boots to protect your feet in the mosh pit!

, Arm and wrist cuffs are popular metalhead accessories. The type you wear might depend on the type of music you listen to.


If you’re into folk metal you might be more likely to wear a forearm cuff of embossed leather.
A viking metal fan might wear a traditional metal viking bracelet.
If you’re into goth or black metal you might wear something a bit more dangerous looking, with spikes or long nails protruding from it.

, Metal fans have all sorts of hairstyles. The main reason for growing your hair long is that it can make it more fun to head-bang, particularly since it makes the head-banging look more dramatic.

,
Deathrockers are huge music geeks, and lovers of obscure bands and equally obscure horror movies (especially zombie movies and supernatural thrillers).,
Slowly begin to develop into the aesthetics of the music no matter how macabre it may seem to you.,
Common punk attire and Mohawks (The common Deathrock variant known as the Deathhawk), Flamboyant make-up and clothes with a cryptic or macabre meaning are great.,
Develop a satirical sense of humour, everything has a meaning no matter how cryptic it is and that can be used for or against you so you might as well use it for your own means.,
Skepticism is the primary thing one needs to show often to an extreme level and ranging from anti-establishment/post modernism to anti-organized dogma.

,
""Develop your meditating and cultivating skills"".,
Go to clubs and experience new local bands and music.",How to Be Deathrock," If you're not already familiar with it, deathrock sounds like a dark and oftentimes humorous mixture of punk, new wave, goth, glam and acid rock. Do not go into a Deathrock club requesting metal influenced artists like Marilyn Manson or Wednesday 13/Murderdolls lest you wish to receive a lot of blank stares - deathrock clubs don't play metal though they do play psychobilly, gothic rock, and '77 punk. Start off with the classic deathrock bands like:


Christian Death
45 Grave
Specimen
Sex Gang Children
Southern Death Cult
Sexbeat
Alien Sex Fiend
Virgin Prunes
Blood and Roses
Bonemen Of Barumba
The Birthday Party
The Gun Club
T.S.O.L.
Rudimentary Peni
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry
Burning Image
Anorexic Dread
Voodoo Church
U.K. Decay
Super Heroines
The Flesh Eaters
Phaidia
The Lords of the New Church
Kommunity FK
Theatre of Ice
The Last Days of Jesus
Mephisto Walz
The Naked & The Dead;
,, They own impressive vinyl collections. Develop a high tolerance towards extremely long and detailed discussion on what to do during a zombie apocalypse and whether you'd be better off owning vinyl, MP3s, tapes of CDs, and be prepared in defend your choice.

, Remember your aesthetics, your body is art hence your attire is to-Do not merely dress for aesthetic pleasing of your friends an peers dress for yourself. Punk is at Deathrocks heart and punk is anti-conformity

, Leopard print, skeleton bones, and ripped fishnet stockings over your arms and legs (for male and female!) are often the best for the deathrock genre. Black is the main color, but a combination with any dark shade of pink ranging from purple to near blood-green will give that haunting effect for your outfit.

, Political and sociological humor are a must, please do understand politics before stating ""Down with the Right-Wing!"" at a democratic caucus. Deathrock is unicorns and rainbows and unicorns and rainbows are a dangerous yet intellectual movement so be aware.

,, Deathrockers are at their core absurdists who believe the only things that give life meaning are relationships with others and creating art. So whether it's designing your own deathrock themed blazer, leather jacket, or just making your own band patches and band t-shirts, and possibly decorating your room or apartment, have fun with it and realize that creating things helps give life meaning.

, Deathrock can be hard to find in some cities, so prepare to visit some goth, punk, Industrial and any horror themed rock concert too!

Seek out influential indie albums (regardless of whether or not you enjoy them).,
When you run out of influential albums, try for the most impressively obscure recordings available.,
Choose one or two bands (of course, the more obscure, the better) to latch yourself onto.,
If you're successful, fellow elitist wannabes will begin to agree with you.,
Establish yourself in your community as an expert on every music-related topic (it doesn't matter whether or not you really know what you're talking about).,
If you're an introverted kind of person (many elitists are), do not fret!,
If possible, you may want to become associated with a group of like-minded elitists.,
As your evolution begins to take place, it's important to begin using new techniques to distinguish yourself.,Alternatively, join the Indie Rock Club at your school

",How to Be an Indie Rock Elitist," Listen to and study them so that you're prepared for conversing with fellow indie rock elitists in the future.;
, If you run out of ideas, you may need to begin listening to groups from other countries, in languages that you don't understand (eg: 60s French pop, popularly known as yé-yé). This is an important facet of advanced elitism.

, Compare everything else to these bands, and whenever possible, make a point of saying that ""is better.""

, Whenever this happens, you need to say something along the lines of ""I liked them first."" This will help develop both your superiority and your bitterness (a staple of elitism).

, Once people begin to respect you, you'll need to start using stronger sarcasm and general rudeness to demonstrate your superiority.

, Discussing music in person is wholly unnecessary. The internet (online message boards, etc.) can be a fantastic tool for exercising your skills at condemning others' taste, as well as allowing you to learn techniques from well-established, expert elitists.

, Your ultimate goal is, of course, to be head of the pack. However, when you're starting out, it can be incredibly helpful to have acquaintances who are willing and able to back you and your opinions up. This will also allow you to form special ""indie inside jokes"" which will not only annoy others, but also increase your feelings of superiority and general indie compatibility.

, You'll need to change based upon current trends, keep surprising people with new styles of sarcasm, etc. Stay alert.

,How to Write a Song1,
"
Work out the melody, if music is what starts to happen in your mind.,
Try the alternative; so, write ""poetry"" before creating the music: Work out the lyrics first, and possibly work with another lyricist as a partner, to get the ""story/poem"" created, possibly for a church worship team, TV drama, theatrical stage production or a movie.,
Work out the structure.",How to Write a Song2," You just begin at the beginning without words. That beginning is to know what works best for you. Many songwriters, such as Peter Gabriel, work out the music before they work out the lyrics. They may sing nonsense syllables just to get a sense of how the lyrics and music might work together.


One of the most famous, most covered songs in history was created this way. The composer woke up one morning with the melody in his head, and sang ""Scrambled eggs, oh you've got such lovely legs"" as the lyrics as he developed the song. He eventually figured it out, and that's how Paul McCartney wrote the song ""Yesterday.""
For a good example of this technique, listen to Peter Gabriel's ""A Different Drum"" starting at about 1:40. His ""lyrics"" are just word-sounds.

, Think of Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein -- Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter -- or Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. Many people find this a much more difficult row to hoe—there's a big difference between poetry and song, and without a solid musical foundation, there are many hurdles to overcome to fit music to the lyrics. Still, when the muse strikes, who really cares if she hits you with the words or the melody first? Grab the inspiration and run with it.

One composer became very well known working with a lyricist: Elton John, putting the lyrics of Bernie Taupin to music. When it's done well, it's very good!

, Most songs have a recognizable formula: The intro, a verse or two with a chorus, a bridge, followed by another verse and chorus, and then out.



The intro. This can be strictly instrumental, a part of the chorus, or something completely off the wall. For example, ""Rocky Raccoon"" by the Beatles starts with a talky introduction describing the character and setting the stage for the song.

The verse. This is the majority of most songs—though not necessarily the most important part. This is the exposition, describing the scene, or the person, or an emotion. Very often there are two or three verses in a row that have the same musical structure, the same rhyme and poetic meter, but different words. The second verse builds on the picture painted in the first verse, etc. Most songs have a recognizable verse structure, though unless you read lyrics on websites, you may not always hear the actual words being said.

The chorus. This is where it all comes together — all the verses have been leading up to the chorus, and is usually the part of the song people sing along with. Think ""All You Need Is Love"" by the Beatles. Can you remember the verse lyrics? Maybe. Can you remember the chorus? It's easy! ""All you need is love!"" However, as important as a chorus can be to a song, it's not necessarily a given. In ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,"" Dylan has one sentence at the end of each verse (the title line), and that's about as close as he gets to a chorus.

The bridge. This is the part of the song that shifts—it can suddenly change tempo, or volume, or instrumentation—it's all fair game. A good example that puts this all together is ""Better Together"" by Jack Johnson. He uses this form: Intro-Verse-Verse-Chorus-Break-Verse-Verse-Break-Bridge-Break-Out

Once you've finished your first song, don't stop.",How to Write a Song3," You really want to be a famous star, don't you? You daydream about being on stage and hearing the roar of the crowd. Only trouble is, gee whiz, you're dreaming your life away.


If you want to write a really good song, you're going to have to work for it. Start today. Commit to writing a certain number of songs per week, the way successful authors commit to writing a thousand words a day.

, You may have your favorite and you may think the other kind of music sucks, but there's a reason people like it. Find out what that is.


Good writers read several genres of books. Good songwriters listen to genres of songs. As you listen, think about what you like about a song. Are the lyrics unique, do the song's chord changes perfectly capture a mood, do you like the transition from one part of the song to another?

, You don't have to have a degree in music theory to write a good song, but you should have an understanding of how songs are built. This includes a basic understanding of harmony, melody, and rhythm.


Harmony is about the chord arrangements and having harmonic qualities that blend with both the rhythmic feel and the melody of the song. A beginner would want to look into basic major and minor keys and chords which pertain to the given key they are working in.

, In the key of C, the chords going up the neck are:


C, Dm (minor), Em, F, G, Am, and Bdim (diminished). They are also called by their scale steps, which has the advantage of not being ""key-centric."" For example, the C is the I (one), the Dm is the II, the F is called the IV, and the G the V.
The I IV and V chords of any key can be thought of as a meat and potatoes way of writing a song, as these three chords will accompany any melody that stays within the given key. Most pop songs are built around a I-IV-V structure.
There are infinite ways to structure a song, but there's a common sequence found in most of them (see Tips). As you listen to songs, try to identify the different parts. Check yourself by looking at lyrics online or in a music book; the parts of songs are often labeled in these media.

, Unfortunately, inspiration usually doesn't strike at the most convenient times, so it's important that you be able to remember each new song that pops into your head, no matter where you are.


Carry a pen and paper with you wherever you go, or better yet, carry a tape recorder or digital audio recorder—melodies can be extremely difficult to capture on paper unless you have a strong music background.

, Think about something that really touched you or changed your life. That special someone? A bully? A bad breakup? Think about it and describe it. How did that feel? Did it hurt? Does (s)he make you think about him or her all the time? Just start by thinking about personal experiences!


It would be helpful if you have a musical instrument (e.g. piano, keyboard, guitar, etc.) so that you can explore the music. An added advantage is that you can easily write down the notes (or tabs) when you have a tune. Try recording it for feedback. Guitars plug directly into computer microphone jacks with an adapter.
You can always go back to your recording. It helps. If you revise it, then record it again.

, Once in a while, inspiration will hit you like a full force gale, and suddenly you have a full song out of nowhere. Most of the time, however, just a small piece of a potential song will come to you, leaving you to do the hard, but fun work of fleshing it out. You should have a feel for what part of the song you've come up with.


If it's super catchy (either a lyrical phrase or a snippet of music), and you can envision it being a repeated theme in the song, you've got the chorus or refrain — the climax or summary of your musical story — and you need to write verses to explain how you know in detail.
If what you've come up with, seems more narrative lyrically or subtler musically—a part of a story rather than the main idea—you've probably got a verse, and you'll need to write the rest of the story (more verses) and, usually, a chorus.

, Make sure your music fits the story. If it is sad, then you may want your melody to evoke sadness (by slowing it down or adding some minor chords, for example) or you might want to add a twist and combine sad lyrics to upbeat music in order to create a sense of tension and ambiguity.

, A song can get by with poor lyrics, and you have a better chance of writing a really good song if your lyrics are great. This does not mean they have to be serious, but they should not be clichéd or ho-hum. Write your lyrics as though you are talking to somebody who you want to impress or to someone toward whom you feel some sort of deep emotion.

, Lyrics can appeal to emotions, and they should also appeal to the ear. There are a few different ways to do this. Words should fit with a rhythm you are creating in the song, and the way these words sound play an important part as well. Some words sound smoother than others (for example, ""cool breeze"" sounds smoother than ""frigid wind."") Use the texture and character of words to add to the feeling of a song.


Another useful tool for the song writer is a rhyming dictionary. There are a variety of ways you can rhyme lines in a song to help tie the lyrics together. Learn about these and other tools of poetry, and try putting them to work for you.
You can rhyme at the end of every line or every other line, or your rhymes can come more sporadically. You can also rhyme within lines to good effect (think of rap lyrics).
There are also other poetic devices you can use, such as alliteration (""They paved paradise, put up a parking lot""). The ""p"" sound is repeated. And, assonance (""...honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you faking""). The repeated ""ah"" sound in ""honesty"", ""promise"" and ""gonna"").
However, do not burden yourself with rhyme! You can get away with making a phrase stand out by avoiding conventional means of fitting it into a song, and many successful songs do not rhyme at all.

, Repetition is what makes a song catchy; repeated choruses, for example, stick in our heads even when the rest of a song does not. It is easy to ask people to join you in a refrain, which is why it is usually called a chorus. That’s why so many people know just a few lines of so many songs.


While there are good songs that are so simple that they have no chorus and have the same line length, the same rhyme schemes, and the same chord progressions repeated throughout them, most people get bored with that. The most common way to add variety is to insert a bridge into your song.
A bridge is a section of music, sometimes instrumental, that differs in its construction from the verses and the chorus, and is usually placed near the end of the song before the final chorus, where a verse would typically be. The bridge can be in a different key—using a different set of chords—than the rest of the song, but it doesn't need to be. It can also be faster or slower, shorter or longer, or otherwise different from the other sections.
Sometimes a bridge is followed by a shorter chorus, depending on the length of the bridge. Be aware that bridges can also refer to the transitions between verse and chorus, as this is a common usage of bridges.

, The hook is that elusive part of a great song that captures your very soul and makes you want to listen to that song over and over. Hooks are frequently found in the chorus and often become the title of the song. Sadly, there is no recipe for hooks, but you'll know when you have one. Better yet, your friends will tell you, because it is the part of a song they can not seem to get out of their head. Here are a few examples:


""Here's my number, call me maybe."" If you've heard Carly Rae Jepsen's hit even once, that will be burned into your synapses forever.
""Oppa Gangnam Style"". PSY's surprise YouTube hit has a hook that, like ""Call Me Maybe,"" has spawned millions of views and almost as many parodies—the sign of a truly infectious hook.
In Tommy Tutone's song ""Jenny/8675309"", the hook lyrics may be the numbers 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.
In the Beatles' song ""Hey Jude"" the hook may be the ending part, Naaa, naa naa, nana naa naaaaaa, nana naa naaaaaaa, hey Jude that repeats and repeats as it bores its way into your brain.
Good hooks let people remember your tune from your lyrics, even if they do not coincide. Many people can remember the riff from 'Smoke on the Water' from hearing the title.

, If the pieces do not fit together, try building a transition. Put all the sections of your song in the same key. If your song suddenly changes in tempo (speed) between the two parts, try gradually changing the speed as you enter and exit the section that does not fit with the rest of the song. Try adding a short instrumental interlude that will carry you from one part to the next. While it is possible that two parts should not be in the same song, it could be that you started one part with the wrong meter or wrong kind of beat.

, Play or sing your song for people and get their opinions. You’ll probably get a better idea of what they really think after you’ve written a few songs: friends and family may tell you that your first song is great even if it’s awful, but as they hear more of your songs, they’ll probably give you hints like, ""It’s good, but I liked that first one you wrote better"" or ""Wow, that’s the best song you’ve written. That’s a really good song."" Be prepared for a critic in the family that will accept nothing less than to hear it post-produced with all the bells and whistles that a band in a studio can offer.

, Keep writing and practicing, and you'll find yourself getting better and better. You may need to write a lot of songs before you hit on one you really like, and even after that, you may need to write a lot more before you get another good one. Work hard and have fun doing it!

Learn these key signatures.",How to Read Music," Before you are ready to start learning music, you must get a sense for the basic information that virtually everyone who reads music needs to know. The horizontal lines on a piece of music make up the staff. This is the most basic of all musical symbols and the foundation for everything that is to follow.


The staff is an arrangement of five parallel lines, and the spaces between them. Both lines and spaces are numbered for reference purposes, and are always counted from lowest (bottom of the staff) to highest (top of the staff).;
, One of the first things you'll encounter when reading music is the clef. This sign, which looks like a big, fancy cursive symbol at the left end of the staff, is the legend that tells you approximately what range your instrument will play in. All instruments and voices in the higher ranges use the treble clef, and for this intro to reading music, we'll focus primarily on this clef for our examples.


The Treble Clef, or G Clef, is derived from an ornamental Latin letter G. One good way to remember this is that the line at the center of the clef's ""swirl"" represents the note G. When notes are added to the staff in the treble clef, they will have the following values:
The five lines, from the bottom up, represent the following notes: E G B D F.
The four spaces, from the bottom up, represent these notes: F A C E.
This may seem like a lot to remember, but you can use mnemonics—or word cues—that may help you remember them. For the lines, ""Every Good Boy Does Fine"" is one popular mnemonic, and the spaces spell out the word ""FACE."" Practicing with an online note recognition tool is another great way to reinforce these associations.

, The bass clef, also known as the F clef, is used for instruments in the lower registers, including the left hand of the piano, bass guitar, trombone, and so on.


The name ""F clef"" derives from its origins as the Gothic letter F. The two dots on the clef lie above and below the ""F"" line on the staff. The staff of the bass clef represents different notes than that of the treble clef.
The five lines, bottom to top, represent these notes: G B D F A (Good Boys Don't Fool Around).
The four spaces, bottom to top, represent these notes: A C E G (All Cows Eat Grass).

, Individual note symbols are a combination of up to three basic elements: the note head, the stem, and flags.



The note head. This is an oval shape that is either open (white) or closed (black). At its most basic, it tells the performer what note to play on their instrument.

The stem. This is the thin vertical line that is attached to the note head. When the stem is pointing up, it joins on the right side of the note head. When the stem is pointing down, it joins the note head on the left. The direction of the stem has no effect on the note, but it makes notation easier to read and less cluttered.
The general rule on stem direction is that at or above the center line of the staff, the stem points down, and when the note is below the middle of the staff, the stem points up.

The flag. This is the curved stroke that is attached to the end of the stem. No matter if the stem is joined to the right or left of the note head, the flag is always drawn to the right of the stem, and never to the left!
Taken together, the note, stem, and flag or flags show the musician the time value for any given note, as measured in beats or fractions of beats. When you listen to music, and you're tapping your foot in time to the music, you're recognizing that beat.

, On a piece of sheet music, you will see thin vertical lines crossing the staff at fairly regular intervals. These lines represent measures — the space before the first line is the first measure, the space between the first and second lines is the second measure, and so on. Measure lines don't affect how the music sounds, but they help the performer keep their place in the music.


As we'll see below, another handy thing about measures is that each one gets the same number of beats. For example, if you find yourself tapping ""1-2-3-4"" along to a piece of music on the radio, you've probably subconsciously found the measure lines already.

, Meter can be generally thought of as the ""pulse"" or the beat of music. You feel it instinctively when you listen to dance or pop music — the ""boom, tiss, boom, tiss"" of a stereotypical dance track is a simple example of meter.


On a piece of sheet music, the beat is expressed by something that looks like a fraction written next to the first clef symbol. Like any fraction, there is a numerator, and a denominator. The numerator, written in the top two spaces of the staff, tells you how many beats there are in one measure. The denominator tells you the note value that receives one beat (the ""pulse"" that you tap your toe to).
Perhaps the easiest meter to understand is 4/4 time, or ""common"" time. In 4/4 time, there are four beats in each measure and each quarter note is equal to one beat. This is the time signature you'll hear in most popular music. You can count along to common time music by counting ""ONE two three four ONE two three four..."" to the beat.
By changing the numerator, we change the number of beats in a measure. Another very common time signature is 3/4. For example, most waltzes will have a steady ""ONE two three ONE two three"" beat, making them in 3/4 time.
Some meters will be shown with a letter C instead of two numbers. 4/4 time is often shown as a big C, which stands for Common time. Likewise, 2/2 meter is often shown as a big C with a vertical line through it. The C with the line through it stands for Cut time.

, Similar to meter and time, ""rhythm"" is a crucial part of how the music feels. However, whereas meter simply tells you how many beats, rhythm is how those beats are used.


Try this: tap your finger on your desk, and count 1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4, steadily. Not very interesting, is it? Now try this: on beats 1 and 3, tap louder, and on beats 2 and 4, tap softer. That's got a different feel to it! Now try the reverse: tapping loud on 2 and 4, and soft on beats 1 and 3.
Check out Regina Spektor's Don't Leave Me. You can clearly hear the rhythm: the quieter bass note happens on beat 1 and beat 3, and a loud clap and snare drum happens on beats 2 and 4. You'll start to get a sense of how music is organized. That's what we call rhythm!

, Each footstep will equal one beat. Those are represented musically by quarter notes, because in much of Western music (meaning music of the western world, not just the music of Hank Williams!), there are four of these beats for every measure. Musically, the rhythm of your walking will look like this:


Each step is one quarter note. On a sheet of music, quarter notes are the solid black dots attached to stems without any flags. You can count that off as you walk: ""1, 2, 3, 4-1, 2, 3, 4""
If you were to slow your pace down to half that speed, so that you only took a step every two beats on the 1 and on the 3, that would be notated with half notes (for half a measure). On a sheet of music, half notes look like quarter notes, only they aren't solid black — they are outlined in black with white centers.
If you slowed your pace down even further, so that you only took a step every four beats, on the 1, you would write that as a whole note—or one note per measure. On a sheet of music, whole notes look like ""Os"" or donuts — similar to half notes without stems.

, Enough of this slowing down. As you noticed, as we slowed the notes down, we started taking away bits of the note. First we took away the solid note, then we took away the stem. Now let's look at speeding things up. To do that, we're going to add things to the note.


Go back to our walking tempo, and picture that in your mind (tapping your foot to the beat can help). Now imagine that your bus has just pulled up to the stop, and you're about a block away. What do you do? You run! And as you run, you try to flag the bus driver.
To make notes faster in music, we add a flag. Each flag cuts the time value of the note in half. For example, an eighth note (which gets one flag) is 1/2 the value of a quarter note; and a 16th note (which gets two flags) is 1/2 the value of an eighth note. In terms of walking, we go from a walk (quarter note) to a run (8th note)—twice as fast as a walk, to a sprint (16th note)—twice as fast as a run. Thinking in terms of each quarter note being a step as you walk, tap along with the example above.

, As you can see with that above example, things can start to get a little confusing when there are a bunch of notes on the page like that. Your eyes start to cross, and you lose track of where you were. To group notes into smaller packages that make sense visually, we use beaming.


Beaming merely replaces individual note flags with thick lines drawn between note stems. These are grouped logically, and while more complex music requires more complex beaming rules, for our purposes, we'll generally beam in groups of quarter notes. Compare the example below with the example above. Try tapping out the rhythm again, and see how much clearer beaming makes the notation.

, Where a flag will cut the value of a note in half, the dot has a similar—but opposite—function. With limited exceptions that do not come into play here, the dot is always placed to the right of the note head. When you see a dotted note, that note is increased by one half the length of its original value.


For example, a dot placed after a half note will be equal to the half note plus a quarter note. A dot placed after a quarter note will be equal to a quarter note plus an eighth note.
Ties are similar to dots—they extend the value of the original note. A tie is simply two notes linked together with a curved line between the note heads. Unlike dots, which are abstract and based wholly on the value of the original note, ties are explicit: the note is increased in length by exactly as long as the second note value.
One reason you would use a tie versus a dot is, for example, when a note's duration would not fit musically into the space of a measure. In that case, you simply add the leftover duration into the next measure as a note, and tie the two together.
Note that the tie is drawn from note head to note head, generally in the opposite direction as the stem.

, Some say music is just a series of notes, and they're half correct. Music is series of notes and the spaces between them. Those spaces are called rests, and even in silence, they can really add motion and life to music. Let's take a look at how they're notated.


Like notes, they have specific symbols for specific durations. A whole note rest is a rectangle descending from the 4th line, and a half note rest is a rectangle resting on the 3rd line. The quarter note rest is a squiggly line, and the rest of the rests are an angled bar with the same number of flags as their equivalent note value. These flags always sweep to the left.

, Make sure you understand the above, and then let's dive into the fun stuff: reading music!

, The C Major scale is the first scale we use when teaching how to read music because it's the one that uses just the white keys. Once you have that locked into your brain cells, the rest will follow naturally.


First, we'll show you what it looks like, then we'll show you how to make sense of it, and begin to read music! Here's what it looks like on the staff. See the ""C scale"" above.
If you'll take a look at the first note, the low C, you'll see that it actually goes below the staff lines. When that happens, we simply add a staff line for that note only—thus, the little line through the note head. The lower the note, the more staff lines we add. But we don't need to worry about that now.
The C scale is made up of eight notes. These are the equivalent of the white keys on the piano.
You may or may not have a piano handy, but at this point it's important for you to begin to get an idea of not just what music looks like, but of what it sounds like, too.

, That may sound intimidating, but chances are, you already know it: it's the fancy way of saying ""do, re, mi.""


By learning to sing the notes that you see, you'll begin to develop the skill of sight reading—a skill that can take a lifetime to perfect, but will be useful right from the beginning. Let's take a look at that C scale again, with the solfege scale added. See the ""C Scale Solfege 11"" above.
Chances are, you know the Rogers and Hammerstein song ""Do-Re-Mi"" from The Sound of Music. If you can sing the ""do re mi"" scale, do that now while you look at the notes. If you need a refresher course, you can hear the song on YouTube.
Here's a slightly more advanced version, walking up and down the C scale using the solfège notes. See the ""C Scale Solfege 1"" above.
Practice singing Solfege—part II a few times, until it becomes familiar. The first couple times, read very slowly, so that you can look at each note as you sing it. The next couple times, substitute the ""do re me"" for C, D, E. The goal is to sing the actual notes.
Remember our note values from before: the high C at the end of the first line, and the low C at the end of the second line are half notes, while the rest of the notes are quarter notes. If you imagine yourself walking, again, there is a note for each step. The half notes take two steps.

,, So far we've covered the very basics of rhythm and melody, and you should possess the basic skills necessary that you now understand what all those dots and squiggles represent. While this might get you through basic Flutophone class, there are still a few more things you'll want to know. Chief among these are key signatures.


You may have seen sharps and flats in music: a sharp looks like a hash tag (♯) and a flat looks like a lowercase B (♭). They are placed to the left of a note head, and indicate that the note to follow is played a half-step higher (for a sharp), or a half-step lower (for a flat). The C scale, as we learned, comprises the white keys on the piano. The sharps and flats are the black keys. Since the C major has no sharps or flats, it's written like this:

, In western music, notes are either a whole tone or a semitone apart. If you look at the C note on the piano keyboard, you’ll see there’s a black key between it and the next note up, the D. The musical distance between the C and the D is called a whole tone. The distance between the C and the black key is called a semitone. Now, you may be wondering what that black key is called. The answer is, “it depends.”

A good rule of thumb is if you are going up the scale, that note is the sharp version of the beginning note. When moving down the scale, that note would be the flat version of the beginning note. Thus, if you are moving from C to D with the black key, it would be written using a sharp (♯).
In this case, the black note is written as C#. When moving down the scale, from D to C and using the black note as a passing tone between them, the black key would be written using a flat (♭).
Conventions like that makes music a little easier to read. If you were to write those three notes going up, and used a D♭ instead of a C#, the notation would be written using a natural sign (♮).
Notice that there's a new sign—the natural. Whenever you see a natural sign (♮) that means that the note cancels any sharps or flats previously written. In this example, the second and third notes are both D's: the first a D♭, and so the second D, since it goes up a semitone from the first D, has to have the note ""corrected"" to show the right note. The more sharps and flats scattered around a sheet of music, the more a musician must take in before the score can be played.
Often, composers that previously used accidentals in previous measures may put ""unnecessary"" natural signs to provide clarity for the player. For example, if a previous measure in a D major piece used an A#, the next measure that uses an A may be notated with an A-natural instead.

, So far, we've been looking at the C major scale: eight notes, all the white keys, starting on C. However, you can start a scale on any note. If you just play all the white keys, though, you will not be playing a major scale, but something called a ""modal scale,"" which is beyond the scope of this article.

The starting note, or tonic, is also the name of the key. You may have heard somebody say ""It's in the key of C"" or something similar. This example means that the basic scale starts on C, and includes the notes C D E F G A B C. The notes in a major scale have a very specific relationship to each other. Take a look at the keyboard above.
Note that between most notes, there is a whole step. But there is only a half step (semitone) between E and F, and between B and C. Every major scale has this same relationship: whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. If you start your scale on G, for example, it could be written like this:
Notice the F# near the top. In order to maintain the proper relationship, the F has to be raised a semitone so that it's a half step from the G, not a whole step. That's easy enough to read by itself, but what if you started a major scale in C#? (See above.)
Now it starts to get complicated! In order to cut down the confusion and make music easier to read, key signatures were created. Each major scale has a particular set of sharps or flats, and those are shown at the very beginning of the music. Looking again at the key of G, we notice that has one sharp—F#. Instead of putting that sharp next to the F on the staff, we move it all the way to the left, and it is just assumed from that point on that every F you see is played as an F#. (See above picture.)
This sounds, and is played, exactly the same as the G major scale above, with no key signature. See the Key Signatures section below for a full list of all key signatures.

, When you listen to music, you have probably noticed that it's not all at the same volume, all the time. Some parts get really loud, and some parts get really soft. These variations are known as ""dynamics.""


If the rhythm and meter are the heart of the music, and notes and keys are the brains, then dynamics are surely the voice of the music. Consider the first version above.
On your table, tap out: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8, etc. (the and is how musicians ""say"" eighth notes). Make sure every beat is tapped at the same loudness, so that it so it sounds sort of like a helicopter. Now take a look at the second version.
Notice the accent mark (>) above every 4th C note. Tap that out, only this time, accent every beat that you see the accent mark. Now, instead of a helicopter, it should sound more like a train. With just a subtle shift in accent, we completely change the character of the music!

, Just like you don't always talk at the same level—you modulate your voice louder or softer, depending on the situation—music modulates in level too. The way the composer tells the musician what is intended is by using dynamic markings.


There are dozens of dynamic markings you may see on a piece of music, but some of the most common ones you'll find will be the letters f, m, and p.

p means ""piano,"" or ""softly.""

f means ""forte,"" or ""loud.""

m means ""mezzo,"" or ""medium."" This modifies the dynamic after it, as in mf or mp, which means ""medium loud,"" or ""medium soft.""
The more ps or fs you have, the softer or louder the music is to be played. Try singing the example above (using solfège—the first note in this example is the tonic, or ""do""), and use the dynamic markings to notice the difference.

, Another very common dynamic notation is the crescendo, and it's corollary, the decrescendo. They are a visual representations of a gradual change in volume which look like stretched-out ""<"" and "">"" symbols.


A crescendo gradually gets louder, and a decrescendo gradually decreases the volume. You'll notice that, with these two symbols, the ""open"" end of the symbol represents the louder dynamic and the closed end represents the quieter dynamic. For example, if the music directs you to gradually go from forte to piano, you'll see an f', then a stretched out "">"", then a 'p'.


, Learning to read music is like learning the alphabet. The basics take a little bit to learn, but are fairly easy, overall. However, there are so many nuances, concepts, and skills that you can learn that it can keep you learning for a lifetime. Some composers even go so far as to write music on staff lines that form spirals or patterns, or the even use no staff lines at all! This article should give you a good foundation to keep growing!

, There is at least one for every note in the scale—and the savvy student will see that in some cases, there are two keys for the same note. For example, the key of G# sounds exactly the same as the key of A♭! When playing the piano—and for the purposes of this article, the difference is academic. However, there are some composers—especially those that write for strings—who will suggest that the A♭ is played a little ""flatter"" than the G#. Here are the key signatures for the major scales:

Keys not using sharps or flats: C
Keys using sharps: G, D, A, E, B, F♯, C♯
Keys using flats: F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭
As you can see above, as you move through the sharp key signatures, you add sharps one at a time until every note is played sharp in the key of C♯. As you move through the flat key signatures, you add flats until every note is played flat in the key of C♭.
It may be of some comfort to know that composers usually write in key signatures that are comfortable for the player to read. D major is a very common key for string instruments to play because the open strings are closely related to the tonic, D. There are few works out there that have strings play in E♭ minor, or brass playing E major - it's as much a pain for them to write as it is for you to read.

Avoid poor man's copyright.,
Be aware of the Berne Convention.",How to Copyright a Song3," There is a long-standing myth in the music industry that the old-fashioned fix of recording a song, placing it in an envelope and mailing it to oneself guaranteed copyright. The post date on the stamp was supposed to serve as proof of the date of origin of the song, provided the envelope remained sealed. However, this method didn't stand up in various court cases and has since been discredited.Moreover, given that your copyright exists on creation, and that an envelope's seal can be carefully unsealed and resealed, this method does seem rather fallible.

, If your country is a member of the Berne Convention, copyright in a song comes into existence when you create it. It does become more complicated when there are several creators who have contributed to the song, but there are rules governing these ""layers."" It's best to seek legal advice in that situation.


The U.S. copyright office is the only one among the Berne Convention's member countries offering a method to register content of the song (lyrics, melody, chord, etc). Unfortunately in all other countries, only the title of the song is recorded. The value of the protection afforded is significantly reduced.

Consider what it is for.,
Consider what instruments, if any, you will use to write it.,
Consider your method of documentation.",How to Compose a Song1," Before you begin composing your song, you will need to consider what it is for. What the purpose of the song is, what type of song it is, will significantly impact the writing process. You should plan accordingly.


If you will be writing a song with lyrics, you will need to consider that while you are writing the song. There are many different ways to go about incorporating lyrics into a song. You can begin with lyrics or words which you set the music to, write the lyrics after writing the melody, or you can try to write both together. It will depend on your skill and style. You will also want to consider the style of music and be sure that it fits the lyrics you are working with and vice versa.
If you will be writing background music, theme music, or some other type of instrumental music, you will need to plan this accordingly as well. Think about what you are writing the music for and what mood you want to convey. Appropriate instruments and music styles will be needed to create the necessary mood, since words won’t be used.;
, Some people will compose entirely from their own mind and will only sing or hum a part if they need to get an idea of how it sounds. Others, especially when writing a piece to be played on a specific instrument, will use that instrument while composing in order to try out how certain things sounds. Think about if you want or need an instrument with you in order to compose and plan accordingly.


Common types of instruments used while composing songs include guitars and pianos, though some people will use certain string or band instruments.

, Consider how you will be writing the music down, in both final format and while you are working. Those with more musical training will want to write sheet music, whereas those who have less may want to write out tabs or chords. If you are writing only for yourself and have a very good memory, it may be possible not to write anything at all (but this is not recommended).

Create a starting tune.,
Create a hook or riff.,
Understand popular song structures.,
Understand classical song structures.",How to Compose a Song2," Before you can begin to compose a song, you will need to have a basic idea of how the song should sound. This tune should be the essence of the song and will be what you build everything else off of.


One starting point would be the melody. This is the basic line of music, usually thought of as the “singable” part of a song. This is a tune which you can easily write lyrics to and build off of.
Another method would be to start with a chord progression. This is a series of chords which will give the overall feel of the song. This may be a better place to start if you don’t have a very good idea of the melody or are having trouble coming up with one.

, A hook is a memorable line or series of lines in a song. Think of it as the part that gets stuck in your head. This catchy bit of tune and lyrics is what will grab your listener's attention and keep them thinking about the song later. A riff serves a similar purpose: it is a noticeable and memorable instrumental piece which is separate from the melody.

, If you want to write song, it is important to understand the basic song structures or forms which dominate popular music. Using these forms will give you a comfortable model on which to build but it will also create a song more in keeping with what your audience is used to hearing. A song too outside of the norm can be off-putting for the majority of audience members, even if it is otherwise good or well performed.


AAAC: This is the title given to song forms in which each verse is musically the same but differs in lyrics. Though uncommon in mainstream music, it can still be found readily elsewhere. A solid example of this song structure is “Amazing Grace”, a common American traditional song.
AABA: This is considered the most common form for popular music today. It comes an a number of variations and can be observed across most genres. In its most basic form, the AABA structure begins with two musically similar verses, breaks for a bridge (the ""B"" in the formula), and then returns for another verse. There are many examples of such a song but a good one is “Something” by The Beatles.

AABABA is probably the most common variant of the overall structure. ABAB, is another variant but less common. ABCD (which is a progressive, non-repeating form) is also sometimes used.


Verse-Chorus: This form is not so common as it once was, but many songs from the first half of the 20th century used it widely. It was still common well into the 1960’s. With this form, the verse takes a backseat to the chorus, which is repeated frequently. A perfect example would be “All You Need is Love” by The Beatles.

There are two major variants of the form: simple and contrasting. In the contrasting form, the music for the verse will be different from the music for the chorus. The simple form, then, is obviously one in which the music is the same.
There is an additional variant, termed Verse-Chorus-Bridge, which adds two or more bars as a small break between choruses. This bridge is always shorter than the verse, and often is followed with a key or tempo change.



, For composing, it can also be helpful to understand classical song forms. These can be used to inspire newer style songs, or they can be used as the basis for more instrumental pieces.


A canon is a song form in which an imitation or repetition of the melody is played after the main melody has begun. It makes use of several layered, echoing “voices” to create its unique sound. A canon in which all of the voices are identical is called a round. An example of this is the song “Row, Row, Row Your Boat”.
The sonata begins with the exposition, which is an introduction to the theme. It is then followed by a section called the development, which explores the themes of the piece. The last section is called the recapitulation, which returns to the theme (usually with a key change) and provides a sense of closure.

Consider pop and rock music.,
Consider country and folk music.,
Consider rap and hip-hop music.,
Consider jazz music.,
Consider electronic and dance music.",How to Compose a Song3," Pop music is a complicated genre because it really isn’t a genre: it’s just whatever is the predominant form of music at the time. For now, pop music is heavily influenced by rock. To write songs like what we consider pop now, you will need to take certain things into consideration.


Form: Pop and rock songs are both very formulaic and put a heavy emphasis on the chorus, which will usually be repeated several times. Choruses also tend to be shorter and catchier, so try to capture those aspects.
Instrument choice: Many of the same instruments are popularly used in rock and pop. Examples would include guitars (though many pop songs will make use of acoustic rather than or in addition to electric guitars), synthesizers/keyboards (in pop music, they are a bit obvious while not commonly used in rock music), bass, drums, and occasionally pianos. Some pop and rock songs will use classical string instruments in the background to add dramatic effect.
Tempo: The tempo associated with pop and rock music will largely depend on the emotion meant to be conveyed in the song. Sadder or more heartfelt songs will need to use a slower tempo, while ones meant to rouse your audience should be faster.

, Country and folk music are related genres which use very similar instrumentation. These genres place a heavy importance on live shows, local musicians, and reasonably low levels of audio editing (preferring the “acoustic” sound and using little autotuning).


Form: The song forms tend to be the same as with more popular music, with an emphasis on the AABA structure. Folk music usually uses more complex, complicated lyrics, however.
Instrument choice: There are a number of instruments which are common to both genres. These include the heavy use of acoustic guitar, dobro, mandolin, a single classical string instrument as backup (such as a fiddle or bass), autoharps and pianos.
Tempo. As with pop and rock, the tempo will largely be determined by the mood of the song. Country music tends to be faster than average while folk tends to be slower than average.

, These related genres are different from the previous ones in that they tend to use different instrumentation and tempo. Forms vary widely, however. Be sure that you are taking these things into consideration when writing this type of song.


Form: While hip-hop and rap both make use of the verse-chorus dynamic, it is much more common to see the AAA structure in these genres than it is in the others. Emphasis is certainly placed on verse, rather than any type of chorus which may be included.
Instruments: Both rap and hip-hop focus very heavily on percussion, rather than instruments like guitars. Certainly, the emphasis is placed on digital methods of making the musical backup to the more central focus on the lyrics. Turntables, samplers, and computers are frequently used, in addition to synths, snares, cymbals, and drums.
Tempo: The tempo for rap and hip-hop music is generally in the range of 90-100 beats per minute. Slower songs are generally categorized as more lyrical and is more commonly seen in hip-hop, while faster songs are considered better for dancing and are more commonly played in clubs.

, Jazz music is extremely complex to play, though technically simple to write. Tempos tend to be slow and the form can vary widely. What is, however, definitive about the genre is the use of call and response and improvisation. When writing a jazz song you will need to leave in room for both of these aspects.


Instruments: Jazz makes more use of brass and wind instruments than the other genres do, often soloing saxophones or oboes. It will also make use of pianos, bass, drums, and guitar.

,


Form: Usually hooks and riffs in this kind of genre are incredibly catchy but can cause a bit of earworm so let's just skip that. Anyway, vocals are sometimes processed with phase vocoder effects to give a robotic feel or some dance songs use samples.
Instruments: So basically the common used instruments are: Vocals, synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines. Sometimes guitars are used but only if the producer wants the dance song to start out as folky and acoustic.
Tempo: The tempo for dance music is in the range of 90-140 beats per minute. The slow, low-tempo (90-105 beats per minute) songs sometimes includes melancholy for it's lyrical content and is played for happiness. The upbeat but midtempo (110-125 beats per minute) songs are danceable for some people and includes little to no melancholy. And the fast and uptempo (125-140 beats per minute) songs are played in raves, clubs, parties, and Coachella so basically anyone in the world could dance to it.

Work with a lyricist.,
Write lyrics yourself.,
Set existing words to music.",How to Compose a Song4," The easiest way to get lyrics for music you have written will be to work with a lyricist. You can work with a friend or you can hire a professional, depending on what you’re trying to achieve. A lyricist can put words to your song after you have written it, work with you while you are writing it, or give you lyrics to work with before you begin.


You will want to ensure that their style meshes with your song. Someone who writes Shakespearean love songs may not write the best heavy metal lyrics. Find someone who gets your song, style, and the feelings associated with it.

, You can write the lyrics yourself, as well. This may require some skill, as it is easy for lyrics to sound cheesy, strange, or silly. Don’t be afraid to work hard at it and take your time.


Try to sing the lyrics as you’re writing them. This will make sure that they sound natural with the melody and there are no strange pauses or mismatched syllables.
Before you begin writing the lyrics, try to determine if you want to use rhyming or non-rhyming words. Knowing how you want the structure of your lyrics to work will go a long way towards helping you write them. Rhyming words will need to be placed at reasonable intervals, which means planning ahead.

, Another option would be to set existing words to music. This can be words from a play, poem, a speech, or anything that you feel would make an excellent song. Choose something that has meaning to you! Your audience will be able to tell when you’re expressing real emotion in your music.


The best way to start setting existing words to music is to find the natural rhythm of the words. Pay attention to how they fit together. Natural speech contains pauses, emphasis, and rhythm. This is what makes it sound natural. Exploit this natural rhythm to make your song.
If you’re having trouble or you want to give your song an edgier feel, experiment with breaking up phrases to emphasize particular words. This can help you overcome awkwardly long sentences or a melody that doesn’t entirely fit the text you’ve chosen.
Don’t forget that you can always omit words or phrases to preserve the flow of your song. If a particular word is throwing off your syllable count and it isn’t necessary, just leave it out or rearrange the words if necessary.

Listen to a wide range of songs.,
Consider the audience.,
Create a message with the mix (optional).,
Gather a rough draft.,
Edit the playlist (optional).,
Arrange the tracks.,
Make adjustments.,
Title your mix (optional).,
Share your compilation.",How to Make a Perfect Mix Tape or CD," If you want to expand your music library before you start making playlists, check out services that can recommend new artists to you. See Sources and Citations below for some ideas.;
, Is this compilation for yourself? Your friends? A significant other? Select music that's appropriate for the tastes of the listener. Your grandma might not like a compilation of your favorite death metal songs, but she may enjoy rare jazz recordings from when she was young.

, Do you want your playlist to let someone know how you feel about him or her? If so, listen carefully to the lyrics of each song that you include in the mix, and make sure they're aligned with what you're feeling.

, Assemble a ""rough draft"" of your playlist by compiling a lot of songs you're thinking about including. You probably won't use all of them in the end, but this step helps you narrow down your options.

, If you gathered more songs than you needed for your playlist or mix, start eliminating those that aren't a perfect fit. Are the lyrics slightly wrong? Does the music make the song fit poorly with the other songs? Could someone use this song to misinterpret your meaning? Ask yourself these questions as you think about what to cut.

, Think of the playlist as a prolonged listening experience - you don't want the listener to get bored or skip songs.


Start out with a few tracks that grab the listener and get his or her attention.
Group songs of similar tempos together, and gradually move into slower or faster tunes.
End the mix on a high note, with one a song that you think will really stick with the listener. Tying in the last song to the theme of the compilation can make it much more effective.

, Finalize your track arrangement and listen to the version a few times. Feel free to remove some tracks and add others. It's possible that you may realize new tracks you'd like to add late in the process.

, If you're sharing your playlist electronically, give it a title that reflects the theme of the mix. Or, if you're out of ideas, name it after the person you're giving it to.

, When you're happy with the mix, burn the CD or share the playlist.

Understand that Christian metal may enable you to listen to the driving beats of hard rock and metal without the lyrics promoting bad stuff.,

,
It's okay to be a Christian and a Metalhead.,
Remember that you like it for the beats, solos, drums, whatever.",How to Be a Christian Metalhead,";
, However, feel free to see whether stuff works -- despite the fact that some say that metal is spawned by Satan himself, and that Christian metal is often considered an insult to secular metal. Your call.

, Keep this in mind - cutting the bad lyrics is good for your development as clean speech for a Christian and an alternative to anti-God/religious metal.

, Nicko Mcbrain is a good example. (Beware: There are fakes out there, who don't exactly follow through in reality/real life with their reported conversions.)

,, It's not what goes in (i.e. lyrics promoting stuff that makes you think, harmful to your Christian development) that matters, it's what comes out (i.e. your actions, words etc.). As listening to music like this may harm your christian development, so it can make you think, elaborating non religious thoughts. Just remember that your faith is more important than your music (life?).

, Use your judgment; if a song is changing your viewpoint and leading you from the Lord- get rid of it.

Improvise.,
Collaborate.,
Introduce counter-melody and harmony.,
Add percussion and embellishments.",How to Compose a Song5," You might want your song to be more than just your voice and a piano. If you do, you’ll need to add depth to your song by elaborating on what you already have. The most basic way to do this is to improvise. Listen to your song and add things where they seem to be needed.

, If your own improvisation doesn’t seem to be enough, you can get friends and fellow musicians together to see what a fresh set of eyes (and ears!) can bring to your work.

, These are variations of the main melody which can be added to give the melody a more fleshed-out feel. A counter-melody is best thought of as a separate melody which fits between the gaps of the first, where a harmony is meant to work in conjunction with the main melody line.

, Add more instruments to the background to give your song more depth. You can do this by adding percussion like drums, a small string quartet, chimes or flutes...the possibilities are almost endless! You can even add in sound effects like wind, thunder, or street noise. Just be sure that the style of the additional sound is in keeping with the style of song you have written.

Do your notation by hand.,
Use a DAW (digital audio workstation).,
Record audio directly.",How to Compose a Song6," You will probably want to write down the music you are writing so that it can be played again, especially if you want it to be played by other people. One way will be for you to write the music down by hand. You can write as little or as much as you want to. Doing this will require a certain understanding of music theory, however.


Lead-sheets are a form of sheet music which include only the most basic notation, usually the melody and harmony. These are common for jazz and improvisational music, as well as with popular musicians who have little musical theory training.

, These are computer programs which are designed for music composers and audio workers. They allow you to mix and record music and will also have a certain level of music notation functionality. These can be expensive, however, and should only be considered by serious musicians.

, Another way would be to record yourself playing and singing the music. From this you can write down the notation or have someone else do so at a later date.

Know your music!,
Get the clothes.,
Get ear gauges.,
Listen to deathcore music.,
Go to shows.,
Understand that deathcore is a fusion of death metal and beatdown hardcore.",How to Be a Deathcore Kid," After all, the primary aspect to the style of deathcore is the music genre of deathcore. Before you get into the music, though, first you must find it. Two great sites that are used for discovering new music are Purevolume.com and Last.fm. Purevolume has top artist/song charts sorted by genre that are perfect for discovering awesome bands. Since Purevolume doesn't actually have ""deathcore"" as a genre option, try looking up the top artists for ""deathcore,"" ""metalcore,"" ""grindcore"", or ""cybergrind"" & mixes of those genres. On last.fm, you can type a certain genre into the search bar and listen to a radio stream that's nothing but that genre (and, unlike Purevolume, last.fm has almost every music genre one could possibly imagine)! As far as an actual list of bands goes, this is a pretty good one to look at. Also, don't be afraid to ask around your town about the local music scene.;
, Ear gauges, jeans, dark hoodies and deathcore shirts are often worn, and are usually the main staple of the deathcore wardrobe. V-necks are quite the deathcore staple with both genders but remember that band t shirts are a must. Shoes are usually kept at black Vans classics or slip-ons, although white sneakers are very popular as well. For girls, keep jewelry either black or silver, and to a minimum. Try also getting long, shaggy hair otherwise you can have short and messy hair or a buzz cut if you don't want long hair. Baseball caps are also good.

, Ear gauges are really common in deathcore.

, Bands include Whitechapel, Job for a Cowboy (pre-Genesis), Suicide Silence, Carnifex, Chelsea Grin, Oceano, Emmure, Bring Me the Horizon (early), A Different Breed of Killer, Despised Icon, Kill Whitney dead, Arsonists Get All the Girls, See You Next Tuesday, Thy Art is Murder, Rose Funeral, Impending Doom (new), Red Chord, Red Shore, Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, Cryptopsy (2008), Winds of Plague, Make Them Suffer, The Faceless (early), As Blood Runs Black, Suffokate, Annotations of an Autopsy, We Butter the Bread With Butter, Waking the Cadaver, ...About a Plane Crash, Through the Eyes of the Dead, Upon a Burning Body, All Shall Perish, Here Comes the Kraken, Catalepsy, Salt the Wound and Deadwater Drowning., Go on a website like ticket master and find concerts to go to.

, It has hardcore-style breakdowns, death metal riffs, blast beats and growled vocals. Bands like the Black Dahlia Murder are NOT deathcore. They are melodic death metal."

Learn about the history and characteristics of thrash metal.,
Learn about the ""Big Four"" of thrash: Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer.,
Don't listen to thrash metal because you think it's cool.,
Try playing a thrash metal song on an instrument.,
Watch a live thrash metal performance.,
Remember that in thrash metal, unlike many other genres, each band almost always writes their own music.,
Understand the context and subject matter.,
Unlike older forms of heavy metal and classic metal, thrash metal vocals are not usually ""sung"" and don't always rhyme.,
Know the subgenres of thrash metal.,
Listen to various albums from different bands.",How to Appreciate Thrash Metal," You will find that there are many different bands around the world, each with different styles. Many thrash metal bands have influenced other metal sub-genres.;
, These four bands were among the pioneers of thrash metal and many bands spawned after. Start with less intense bands like Anthrax and Metallica. If your ears are not used to louder sounds, don't start with a band like Kreator or Sodom. Thrash metal songs usually use fast guitar riffs with shredding-style guitar solos.

, The stereotype about thrash metal fans being aggressive and violent is not true. Remember that it's all about the music and you don't have to grow long hair and change the way you look.

, You'll realize the guitar riffs are fast and difficult to play and compose. Bass and drum playing is also difficult, due to the genre's high speed. In fact some Thrash Metal drummers like Dave Lombardo (Slayer) and Charlie Benante (Anthrax) are regarded as some of the best drummers in heavy metal.

, Even if it's on a TV screen, observe how the group members manipulate the instruments. If you've ever tried to play those instruments yourself, you'll probably be amazed with how skillfully they play. It takes practice, and dedication, which challenges the stereotype of metalheads being lazy and careless. You might also be surprised about how energetic some of the performers are.

, That includes the riffs, drums, solos, and lyrics. Writing your own music demonstrates another dimension of instrumental mastery and talent, as well as making the music more personal and less manufactured.

, Thrash metal lyrics and themes demonstrate rebellion and anger. Topics such as politics, war, and violence are common in thrash metal. The fact that thrash metal musicians aren’t afraid to talk about anything from ANY point of view in their music lyrics is probably the main reason that many people avoid thrash metal. And NOTE: Few Thrash Metal bands have Satanic/Anti-Christian lyrics, and if you’re seriously against that kind of stuff, Slayer are bands to avoid. Although some bands use satanic lyrics in songs, most are not actually Satanists including Slayer. And use this rule for the lyrics: The more over-the-top the lyrics are, the less seriously you should take them.

, Thrash vocals are usually very aggressive and sometimes angry sounding, but they are still understandable.

, Many thrash metal bands use death metal, black metal, and hardcore in their music. Thrash metal with even more hardcore elements than standard thrash is called crossover thrash or crossover for short. Its overall sound is more hardcore-influenced than traditional thrash metal, while more melodic than traditional hardcore and thrashcore. Crossover is often more aggressive and simpler than traditional thrash metal due to the heavier hardcore influence. There is even a resurgence of thrash bands! Some Thrash band have even re-recorded old material, you may find it more to your liking, since they have better production value(i.e. First Strike Still Deadly - Testament / Let There Be Blood - Exodus).

, Try not to focus on just one or two bands, listening to many bands will give you a better understanding of the genre. Here is a basic list of recommended albums (only one from each band):


...And Justice For All - Metallica
Rust in Peace - Megadeth

A lot of metal is melodic and beautiful, as well as very complex and technically demanding. Many musicians have been playing their instruments for years and are professionally trained, often being able to play at very high levels of proficiency. Many of them incorporate influences from genres such as classical, jazz, folk, and opera. Additionally, metal bands virtually always write their own music, including the melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, plus their own lyrics, etc., all of which keeps the music genuine, as opposed to the fake, manufactured feel of most popular music. That being said, metal is often more aggressive and intense than more mainstream-oriented ""radio rock"", and lyrics often touch on more controversial topics such as war or violence (albeit usually as a form of social criticism rather than a vehicle to condone such things). Other bands may write about topics such as fantasy, addiction, history, religion, politics, literature, philosophy, relationships, hedonism, or death. Bands with more extreme lyrics often intend their songs to be taken as tongue-in-cheek or sometimes for shock value, and in most cases shouldn't be taken seriously. The most common instrumental setup for a metal band is one or two electric guitar(s), a bass guitar, drums, vocals, and sometimes a keyboard/piano, although it is not limited to that. Some bands incorporate additional instruments, sometimes opting for a symphonic sound, or using other unusual instruments for a more avant-garde approach. Oftentimes the vocalist also serves as an instrumentalist. Some bands write all or mostly instrumental music. Metal vocals vary widely in style, from the multi-octave, theatrical approach of Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, to the gruff style of Motörhead's Lemmy and Metallica's James Hetfield, to the growling of many death metal performers, and to the harsh shrieks and screams of black metal. There are a number of successful female vocalists as well.;
, Do you like fast paced music or slower music? Do you want to hear guitars shredding or guitars playing melodies? Do you want to listen for the drumming? Do you want to listen for lyrics? What lyrical themes are you looking for? Do you mind growling vocals, or do you want lighter vocals? Or no vocals at all? Try starting with classic heavy metal and then work your way to the ""Big 4"" of thrash metal (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax). Also ask for help on forums or research each genre more to decide which you may like. Any metalhead will be all to happy to help a newcomer out and share their knowledge.

, Don't put it on in the background and tune it out. Most metal cannot be fully appreciated if you do not focus while listening. Listen to each instrument. Try to follow the rhythm. Listen to the vocals. If you cannot understand them, look the lyrics up either in the album's booklet or online. And listen through multiple times. Albums from the more complex subgenres often take several listens to really get into and understand, and the more you listen the more layers you uncover. Most metal doesn't rely on groove or instantly catchy hooks like much pop and rock does. Don't give up if your first impression isn't great. A lot of metal ""grows on you"" and if it doesn't, try another band. Metal is so diverse there is at least one type for everyone.

, Don't worry, you won't get thrown into a mosh pit unless you choose to step into one. If going to a show doesn't sound appealing, at least watch videos online. Seeing a band work together and watching each member master their own instrument can give you a better appreciation of the work they put in, especially if you play an instrument yourself. Composing music and playing music live are two different skill sets, both of which metal bands have to be good at to become successful.

, When and where was each genre popular? How did different genres affect each other? What artists pioneered each genre? Who are some of the major metal icons? This information can be found online, by talking to metalheads, or by reading about it in books. The more facts you know, the fewer false, stereotypical, preconceived notions you'll have.

, It can be at shows and in mosh pits, or just sitting back and enjoying it. Maybe you want to try to play it on an instrument, or to write your own. Maybe you want to read the lyrics and try to understand and relate to them. Many people listen while driving or while doing anything else. It can be great motivation at the gym or while running. It could be for when you drift off to sleep (no joke, people will fall asleep listening to doom metal).

Continue learning about jazz.",How to Appreciate Jazz Music," The melody is the main theme of a song.In jazz, it's common for you to hear the same song twice and notice many differences between performers, performances, and even recordings. This is because jazz musicians have a great deal of freedom in how they play the base melody serving as the foundation for its sound.Learning to pick out the main melody among the complex variations of individual instrumentalists is part of the fun of jazz!


You may notice that some performers have certain features or a distinct sound. Picking out and noticing these features can be a fun way for you to engage the music.
If you hear a melody you particularly enjoy, you may want to explore variations of it. To do this, you might search for performances of the same song by different jazz artists or ensembles online.
Listening to a song you're already somewhat familiar with may help you pick out the melody more easily. Some famous jazz hits you might want to give a listen to include ""Take Five,"" ""Sing, Sing Sing,"" ""So What,"" and "" 'Round Midnight."";
, There are many layers to jazz music. The melody should be the most distinct, topmost layer, but behind that you should hear a harmonious structure of chords. Generally, there will be three different chords used, with each of these being played in various ways to give the harmony of the song a broad range of variety.


It's very common for artist to break up harmonic chords to create a sustained, pleasing sound while the melody is played. You may want to keep an ear out for broken chords, rolled chords, and other variations in the harmony while listening to jazz.Many public radio services, like your local classical/jazz station or NPR, have segments devoted to jazz music. You may learn more about harmony listening to these segments and the accompanying commentary of the DJs.

, The complex and regularly changing rhythms of jazz are a key feature to the genre. The main beat of a song will often be elongated or shortened to add punch and flourish to the musical phrases in it.You can easily notice where artists take liberties with the beat by following along with the main beat yourself.


While listening, it may help you follow the beat if you tap your foot or your hand steadily in time with the music. This will be the dominant rhythm of the song.
When you notice players hold out or cut short beats, you've discovered a change to the rhythm. These off-beat rhythms generally sync up with the main beat later on.
You may want to tap along quietly, especially if you are attending a live jazz performance. Following the beat too loudly by clapping/tapping your hands/feet could disrupt the musicians.Swing music, having a pronounced rhythmic quality, may make feeling the rhythm easier for you. Some popular swing tunes you might be interested hearing include ""Caravan,"" ""Take the 'A' Train,"" and ""Sweet Georgia Brown.""

, Improvisation may be the feature of jazz most familiar to you. However, you may not know that there are different kinds of improv that jazz musicians use when playing. These are broken up into three main categories that you may want to keep in mind when listening:


Paraphrase improv. Paraphrase improv uses the melody like a springboard. Oftentimes, an artist will feature the melody strongly throughout the piece, waiting for specific places or themes before exploding into a variation.Motivic improv. The name of this kind of improv comes from the word ""motif."" It uses repeated sections of the song at higher and lower intervals to change the atmosphere and quality of the motif being repeated.Formulaic improv. This kind of improv requires the most technical knowledge on the part of the performer. During formulaic improv, a musician will insert highly complex combinations of notes, often referred to as ""licks,"" to spice up a solo., Since improvisation is such an important part of jazz music, the players in an ensemble must be well coordinated for there to be cohesion throughout a performance. In many cases, this takes the form of signals, gestures, or other kinds of cues between players, like a certain riff played on an instrument or a particular note in the melody that's leaned on heavily.


Looking for the signals between performers, or even noting the level of unity and balance among them, can add another level to your jazz appreciation. You may find that, even if you don't like the tune, the interaction between players still makes the music enjoyable., There may be a local jazz club or bar near you where you can listen to jazz. However, if this kind of environment isn't your scene, many universities and music institutes/conservatories put on jazz events throughout the year that you can attend. One benefit to seeing jazz live is its engagement of your senses. Not only can you hear the music and see the performers in action, but in many cases you will be able to feel the music as its vibrations hit your skin.


Observe good etiquette while you're at a jazz performance. This is especially important at a jazz club or bar. Most performers will expect you to be respectful during the performance; this means you should keep the volume of your conversations to a minimum.The spontaneous nature of jazz makes live events the perfect place for you to get into the spirit of the genre. Recordings, in many cases, fail to convey the atmosphere of a performance., Many communities put on local events and festivals celebrating the jazz, its history, and its culture. This is an excellent opportunity for you to mingle with and learn from longtime jazz fans and musicians. At many of these events, influential jazz artists as well as up-and-comers will play music, giving you a chance to hear contemporary and classic jazz.


Depending on the region in which you live, the kind of festivals available will vary. Some major jazz festivals you might consider visiting include the Chicago Jazz Music Festival (late August/early September), Saratoga Jazz Festival (late June), Portland Jazz Festival (mid February), Fillmore Street Jazz Festival (early July), and Jacksonville Jazz Festival (late May)., While listening to the jazz, it's easy to get caught up in technical details or you can be distracted by your search for specific features in a song or ensemble. Ultimately, jazz is based on the emotions of the performers. The sound they craft during a performance is intended to capture that feeling, whatever it may be. Try to feel with the performers as they play.Although the atmosphere of a venue can contribute a great deal to the atmosphere, it can also be distracting. You may want to close your eyes during part of the performance, and see what feelings, colors, shapes, or thoughts are evoked by the music., The ""swing"" rhythm used in jazz songs infuses the music with a sense of forward momentum, bounciness, lightness, and urgency. This excitable ambiance looks for a similar response the listener, creating a kind of conversation between performers and audience. This is intentional, as swing was derived from call-and-response musical styles of that time.Jazz was originally used as dance music in the early 1900s for youth rebelling against musical and social conventions. If you're at an appropriate venue, you may find that you connect better with jazz when you get out of your seat and start dancing along., Because jazz and the blues essentially grew up alongside each other in the early 1900s, you'll find many similarities between the two genres of music. In particular, you'll notice that both jazz and the blues make use of blue notes, which are notes played a little lower than the major scale of a piece. This gives the music its iconic, mournful, ""bluesy"" sound.In listening to blues and other music originating from the same period as jazz, you'll gain a finer understanding for the atmosphere of that era. This could help you connect more deeply with the music on an emotional or technical level.
The blues have been played in some form or another since the late 1800s, so there are many artists in this genre you might listen to. However, three blues musicians highly influential to the jazz scene include W.C. Handy, Huddie “Lead Belly” Ledbetter, and Bessie Smith., Ragtime introduced the jazz scene to syncopation, which is the practice of strengthening weak beats and weakening strong beats.This style is featured extensively in jazz. You should note the offbeat quality syncopation gives jazz music. This creates variety and a sense of drive in the music that makes it more exciting.You can get a better feel for syncopation with a foot tapping exercise. Tap your foot up and down steadily. When you bring your foot down, say ""Oom"" and when you raise your foot say ""pah."" So as you tap, you should say ""Oom-pah, oom-pah."" Then, while continuing tapping your foot, only say the ""pah."" This ""pah"" represents the syncopated beat.
Jazz artists will include a mix of syncopated (off-beat) and non-syncopated (on-beat) rhythms. This creates additional complexity and emphasis in the song. Identifying off- and on-beat rhythms may add a new dimension to your appreciation of jazz., The New Orleans music scene greatly encouraged the use of brass instruments and syncopation in jazz while contributing to ensemble structure. This structure generally relied on a brass instrumentalist, frequently called the ""frontline,"" and a two person rhythm section. Popular frontline instruments included the trumpet, cornet, trombone, and clarinet. Rhythm section instruments often included the piano, drums, string bass, and banjo.Thanks to the invention of the phonograph, many classic songs that came out of the New Orleans jazz age could be preserved. Listen along with Joe “King” Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, and The Original Dixieland Jass Band to familiarize yourself with New Orleans jazz., Jazz has a long and colorful history that includes many styles and sub-genres. Classic jazz, swing, bebop, cool jazz, bossa nova, jazz fusion, acid jazz, and other jazz sub-genres ensure that you'll have plenty to listen to in your journey to gain a better appreciation of jazz.To gain a more formal understanding of jazz and jazz history, you may want to take a class on the subject. These can frequently be found at your nearest local university, community college, community center, or school of music.
You may find that a trip to a historic jazz site, like a nightclub or historic jazz composer's home, gives you a fuller understanding of jazz. Many of these sites have information in the form of pamphlets that you can use to buff up on jazz.

Look up emo music articles on internet music magazines, like Stereogum.Sources like this can give you a sense for where emo fits into music culture, both at the present and the last few years. Such sources can also give you a balanced idea of what sets emo apart from a technical standpoint.


Take the time to get a grasp for emo musical structure, how it varies from typical verse-chorus-verse patterns, and other important sound qualities.Learn what to listen for when you hear a track, and be able to explain why it’s typically identified as emo.
Judging music genres is a bit like judging a dog show: instead of comparing one breed with another, the judge asks how well a dog meets the standards of its particular breed. Get to know emo’s particular standards before making any judgments.
It might seem a bit boring, but making sure you can understand musical qualities can help you learn more about what you like, discover more music, and be able to explain clearly why you don’t like something.;
, In 2004, a well-known musicologist claimed that the Beach Boys’ “Pet Sounds” (1966) was the first emo album – and “Pet Sounds” is often found at the tops of all-time rock album lists!Even if that claim doesn’t hold up, it’s undeniable that emo traces its lineage to the hardcore punk scene in the mid-1980s.Get to know the genre’s history: from these roots, to its mainstream popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to what many call its post-2013 revival.


Stereogum, and other internet sources such as Treblezine, can tell you about emo’s roots, it’s “Golden Age” in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and its post-2013 “revival.”, Like any genre in the age of mass communication, it’s easy to think of emo as just what you hear on the radio or other popular media. Emo is more like a loose collection of subgenres, however, rather than a rigidly defined category. Not every band sounds like what you hear on the radio, especially since its recent “second wave.”While it’s helpful to know what the best known examples of emo music are, make sure you’re taking the time to discover lesser known artists.

You might think of the vocals as an insistent reminder of a feral shared past and the animal within all human beings.


You might not be able to relate to the content of the song, but you may have an event in your past that fills you with the same primitive feeling expressed by the vocalist. Making this association may help you connect with the emotional message behind the music.;
, Throughout the genre, you may have noticed a lack of bass while the upper range, the treble, is raw and piercing. This creates an agitated kind of distortion that blurs one sound with the next. This distortion/blurring effect is intended to give you a feeling of suspension in time., The speed of Black Metal is general very fast, often with many repeated notes played in rapid succession. This drawn out effect can add to the indistinct atmosphere, with the repeated notes adding a sharp, continuous spike in the distortion.


The English Speed Metal band, Venom, is largely credited for contributing this characteristic to the Black Metal genre. By listening to Venom and other Speed Metal bands, you may gain a better understanding of and appreciation for Black Metal., Unlike many other kinds of metal, Black Metal is notable for its strong stance against contemporary established religion, especially Christianity. This counter-culture may be reflected lyrically in the form of Satanism, medieval paganism, or other kinds of pre-Christian religion.


Many Black Metal bands also utilize the mythic imaginings of writers, such as J.R.R. Tolkien, writer of The Lord of the Rings. It's likely you'll find that some of the names used in your favorite Black Metal songs allude to characters or places in Tolkien's books.
The writings of Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, are also prominently featured in Black Metal.You'll find the basic tenets of Satanism widespread through Black Metal culture.
Another theme you'll want to be on the look out for is the use of language that yearns for a return to times long since past. This may manifest in the form of medieval clothing, practices, or anachronistic actions, like the sacrifice of animals., The variety within Black Metal makes it notoriously difficult to pin down exact features, though there are many similarities throughout the genre. You'll have to come to terms with the fact that not only are there many different kinds of Black Metal, but there also many different opinions of what Black Metal is. Within the genre, there are two main camps:


The purists. You'll find that these fans revere the genre in its original, underground form. If you find yourself more drawn to the raw, straightforward style of non-mainstream Black Metal, you may be a member of this group.
The inclusives. These kinds of fans use a much broader definition for Black Metal. If you enjoy the raw underground but think it's just as Black Metal as the more technical work produced by mainstream bands, you're likely an inclusive., Many Black Metal artists wear clothing that resembles peasant or noble garb of the Dark Ages, but you may also want to try out spiked collars, leather articles of clothing, or military themed outfits.For accessories, you might think about adding an upside down cross necklace or jewelry that reflects pagan or Satanist culture, like the pentagram or the triskelion.


Shedding your normal, hum-drum clothing can help you transform your mindset from the everyday mentality to one that is darker and edgier. This can also help you feel more at place when attending Black Metal events.

, There may be Black Metal themed bars or venues around you where you can meet like-minded fans. If this isn't an option where you live, you might join Black Metal message boards or online communities to become a more active part of the community and the culture.


Taking part in the Black Metal community can help you better understand and internalize many of the feelings of the culture at large. However, as individualism is a noted feature of Black Metal, you may also want to think about the culture in terms of what it means to you., You should be prepared for the often gruesome theatrics that are frequently involved in a Black Metal show. In some cases, this might involve the killing of animals, like sheep or pigs, on stage. Sometimes bands will even throw parts of a slaughtered animal into the audience.If violence to animals or the representation of blood and gore upset you, you may want to avoid a live Black Metal performance. However, you can still enjoy the Black Metal sound on CD or by downloading your favorite albums.
The volume at live performances can be quite loud, so you'll want to take steps to protect your hearing. In many cases, you can buy a pair of suitable earplugs at your local drug store for this purpose.

, To gain a better understanding of Black Metal and how it relates to you, you might find it helpful to read some of the material commonly referenced in the genre. In doing so, you may find that lyrics otherwise unintelligible take on a new, personally accessible meaning.


Due to the heavy Satanic influences, you may want to delve into the writings of Anton LaVey. However, the anti-Christian elements of Black Metal also make Nietzsche's famous work, The Antichrist, useful to know.
To gain a fuller understanding of medieval allusions in Black Metal, you may want to read Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Beowulf, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Elder Edda, and more. These books give you a better perspective of the olden days to which many Black Metal artists desire to return., The first wave of Black Metal took place in the 1980s, establishing many of the audio characteristics of the genre.The raw, unpolished sound of these bands will give you insight into how Black Metal has changed over the years and whether or not you prefer the lower-production value highly esteemed by purists or the more technical sound appreciated by inclusives.


There are many bands you might choose to listen to while investigating the first wave of Black Metal. Some bands to consider include Bathory, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost., This era in Black Metal finds its roots in the early '90s and was led by many then-prominent Norwegian bands. At this time, the genre began to define itself more narrowly, though many divisions as to what was ""true"" Black Metal remained.


Some notable second wave Black Metal groups include Carpathian Forest, Darkthrone, Emperor, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Mayhem, and Satyricon. You may find the second wave most suitable for your Black Metal taste.

, Within Black Metal you'll find many sub-genres, and some of these may be more palatable to you. As each sub-genre highlights a different feature within Black Metal, the focus on these may also help deepen your understanding of the genre as a whole. Some sub-genres you may want to look into include:


Ambient Black Metal. This sub-genre can be less abrasive than other varieties. In many cases, it incorporates strong atmospheric sounds to give a dreamlike sensation to its music. Two artists prominent in this sub-genre are Agalloch and Wolves in the Throne Room.Black 'n Roll. This version of Black Metal combines the styles of hard rock, glam rock, and adds a dash of rock 'n roll. Some examples of Black 'n Roll include Kvelertak, Vreid, and Khold.Symphonic Black Metal. You'll find that this style uses more symphonic and instrumental sounds in its production. Some examples of instruments that might be used include the piano, violin, and cello.

Make some slight changes to the music you like, unless you are already pretty open.,
Try listening to progressive heavy metal that doesn't exclusively use the death growl as vocals, if you are into very flexible styles of music.,
Listen to some alternate forms of music, to get you into the groove, if you are into Beethoven and Mozart.,
Begin listening to groups with harder and more harsh vocals, if you are into Suffocation and Vile, this is definitely the best place to be in.,
Listen to music closer to your original genre that is faster.,
Listen to hard rock music.,
Listen to in-game and whatnot rock radios, because they plan often metal songs that seem not to be it.,
Listen to melodic metal songs.,
Have patience and take your time.",How to Appreciate Heavy Metal," From here the next step to metal are groups like Megadeth, Judas Priest, Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden, and classic Black Sabbath. Remember to take it slow and easy, and really learn to appreciate and like the group.;
, Bands like Opeth can show you that both the soft and the brutal can be beautiful.

, You are in the most flexible state, so it should be easy. If you like these guys, then you should appreciate almost anything as long as it is well done. To get into the style, we would suggest old Metallica, Slayer, and old Anthrax. For getting into or used to the vocals, we would suggest Kreator, Death, and Venom. Stick mainly with old death metal or thrash metal for the beginning.

, For you, I would just suggest getting into groups that are harder and use more harsh vocals (growling/screaming). Just embrace the music and listen to it enough to get use to it and you will eventually enjoy it. As far as groups, I would suggest groups like Cannibal Corpse, Arch Enemy, and Entombed.

, Listen to more aggressive, but not hate filled, bands. You should also try to understand the lyrics and the mindset of the musicians so you can adopt it yourself, and so you can truly get into the music. Real music does not follow a verse chorus bridge verse chorus cycle. Metal uses a narrative style like classical music. The music progresses and evolves, almost as if it was telling a story. Listening to classical music will help the transition because you would get used to the narrative style.

, Hard Rock really works for getting into metal. However, if you're really not into it and seem not to be able to like it, you don't have to.

, As an example, V-Rock (GTAVC) plays Queen of the Reich. It doesn't sound like metal, but the second you read about it's metal, you just make it sound like metal!

, They are usually useful for getting into metal. They're melodic and catchy. Be aware that heavier genres can also be both, but in a singular way., It might take years to learn to love metal, not only a couple of weeks. After all, music is all about enjoying to hear people using instruments and vocal chords in their way of doing it!

Check your room for reflections.,
Remove hard surfaces.,
Add furniture and décor.,
Install foam panels.,
Check your room for reverberations.,
Install dampening baffles.,
Install a resonator.,
Install absorbers.,
Enlarge your room.",How to Acoustically Tune a Room," Reflections are necessary for sound to be heard. When you make a noise, the sound reflects off a nearby wall and hits your eardrum. In reality, a room with poor reflections will result in poor acoustic sound quality, so fixing the problem of reflections will drastically improve acoustic quality in your room.


Clap your hands. If you hear a fluttery echo, then you definitely have an issue with reflections.;
, Reflections are caused by bouncing sound waves, and sound waves bounce off of hard surfaces. Avoid surfaces made of wood, concrete, glass, or leather. Soft materials, like cloth, will dissipate sounds and reduce reflections.

, Filling your room with large objects will force the sound waves to bounce in many different directions, effectively reducing reflections. Consider furniture pieces like bookshelves and couches, as well as décor like heavy rugs and window curtains.

, Not only are foam panels great for dissipating sound waves, they are very light and portable. Mount them on the walls and ceiling when your room requires acoustic tuning and remove them when you're done.

, Depending on the size of your room, sound waves of a specific frequency will cancel themselves out. This means you won't be able to hear those sounds no matter what you do, even if people outside of your room hear them just fine.


Measure your room. Reverberations can be difficult to detect, so room measurement is the easiest way to go about it. If either the width or the length of your room are less than 13 feet (4 meters), then you probably have an issue with acoustic tuning reverberations.

, The corners of a room tend to amplify the effects of low frequency reverberation, so place dampening baffles in the corners of your room for effective tuning.

, Resonators are effective at reducing reverberations because they capture and trap specific sound frequencies. However, because resonators are only effective at trapping specific frequencies, you'll need to do some tuning every time your room composition changes.

, There are companies devoted to acoustic tuning that create products specifically designed to improve acoustics in any room. Absorbers are engineered to improve acoustics as much as possible while remaining easy to use and install, so they are perfect for effective tuning.

, For the acoustic tuner who has the available resources, stretching the length of the walls and enlarging the available space will lessen the effects of both reflections and reverberations.

Choose appropriate music for the environment.,
Learn about its origins.,
Pay reasonable attention to setting, which includes time, place, atmosphere and other factors - all play an important part in helping one value and learn to appreciate music of all types.",How to Appreciate Different Styles of Music," Everything is easier to appreciate when it's matched well with a suitable environment.


A good rock song by Aerosmith would be better appreciated in a high volume environment, and a classic soul piece by Barry White or Issac Hayes is better when played in a quiet room since they sing slow jams that are sensual or romantic.

Salsa wouldn't sound appropriate in a fancy, up-scale opera house in Washington D.C. However, it would sound perfect in a dance club in Miami.;
,


Rock and roll originated in the 1950s with Elvis Presley and was popularized by The Beatles.






Rap/Hip hop began in New York in the 1970s. DJ Cool Herc is generally considered the father of hip-hop, which grew out of the all night dance parties that he threw in the Bronx after moving there from Jamaica.
R&B, or Rhythm and Blues, was created in the late 1940s and eventually, in the 1950s -60s it evolved into soul.
No one person really knows where and when Salsa, one of the most important and most popular genres of Latin-based music, was created. Some people say it started in Cuba, others say in Puerto Rico and others go even further into Central and South America, pointing to Colombia, Brazil and Argentina. The word salsa means 'sauce' or 'saucy' in English, and this term was first used in the 1960s to describe this fast and exotic, beat-driven Caribbean music. The most influential artists at the beginning of Salsa were Hector Lavoe and Celia Cruz.







,

Classical music has inspired lots of today's music.To hear classical music's influence on rock, first listen to some Beethoven (5th and 9th Symphonies) and Mozart (Serenade 13 ""A Little Night Music""), then listen to Queen's ""A Night At The Opera."" It's fun to note the evolution of music, and you will begin to hear the influence of what's come before what's happening now. Mozart wrote great, singable ""tunes"" or melodies. Beethoven did, too, but with more muscle. Classical music covers a huge range of diverse music: try to listen to different works form different times, places, and styles. Listen to the music of composers such as Gustav Mahler, Igor Stravinsky, and Dmitri Shostakovich to get a sample of more modern and aggressive classical music.






Rock and Roll can be loud, soft, trashy or slick; it can encompass pop, metal and blues. It's fun when you have friends over, because it's popular. Rock encompasses everything from The Beatles to The Police to No Doubt to Pantera - it's all sub-genres of the same verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/verse/chorus structure. Car sing-along are encouraged.






Progressive rock is a blending or fusion of jazz, classical and rock and roll influences. This genre encompasses bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Spock's Beard, Dream Theater and Nektar. Songs are usually quite long compared to other genres, and tend to progress through 'movements' similar to classical music. Concerts seem to be the place to go to enjoy this with others who like the same style of music.

Rockabilly is raucous and fun, somewhat old school, but it almost always follows a predictable structure, so it feels familiar - Elvis, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, the Blasters, and the Stray Cats are great examples. Try these at parties where you want people to dance.
Folk Music has been around forever; it's generally the song of a people. Folk songs are passed down from generation to generation, usually just by being sung; ""You Are My Sunshine,"" ""Jimmy Crack Corn,"" and ""This Land Is Your Land"" are all examples of American folk tunes. There are modern folk singers who have appropriated the genre, such as Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger. Folk has woven its way into every genre of every country's music (in the USA, Simon & Garfunkel, the Mamas & Papas); it is the indigenous music of the land where you live. It's fun at campfires because everyone usually knows all the words.

Country & Western music has roots in old cowboy songs (which is really the Western in the C&W), Hawaiian and folk tunes. Try Hank Williams, Tammy Wynette, George Strait, Vince Gill, Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban. Nice at picnic style family gatherings because the old people tend to not complain about it.
Pop is really just a softer sort of rock; but there are pop punkers, too. The Monkees, vocal acts like ABBA, Ben Folds Five, k.d. lang, and pop-punkers (also called alternative rockers) Fall Out Boy, and The Killers are all fine choices. Great at smaller, more informal gatherings, or to sing along with in the car.






Rap and Hip Hop was originally identified with urban African Americans, starting back with Run DMC and Sugarhill Gang, evolving to the more pop, mainstream sounds of MC Hammer, and eventually including 50 Cent, Eminem, and others. The content can be challenging (language, subject matter - mostly for more mature listeners).

Broadway, Musical and Opera are also fun to sing along with during housework, in the car, and with friends. Carmen, by Bizet is great - compare ""Toreador"" to the ""Imperial March"", from Star Wars; La Boheme by Puccini inspired the modern version, Rent. The Magic Flute, by Mozart, is the second part of a trilogy in the fairy tale genre; the first being ""The Philosopher's Stone"" a collaboration between Mozart and three other composers, and the third being ""The Labyrinth"" by Winter, (after Mozart's death) all using some of the same musical material. Ring of the Nibelung, by Wagner contains the amazing, bold ""Ride of the Valkyries, and inspired Tolkien's trilogy, ""Lord of The Rings""; the music is available separately by Howard Shore."" For clever lyrics, Kander and Ebb musicals can't be beat - try ""Cabaret"" the movie soundtrack or ""Chicago"". Even Disney musicals can be fun to sing along to with kids - try ""The Little Mermaid,"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""Lady and the Tramp."" One composer considered among the most brilliant of all time is Stephen Sondheim. Many people who claim not to enjoy musical theater end up enjoying his work a great deal. Among his best and most famous works are ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Sunday in the Park with George.""
Probably venturing into dangerous territory here, but even Disco is fun if you're in the right frame of mind. Donna Summer is the undisputed queen of disco - sensual, sexy vocals and pulsating disco beats abound; or the Bee Gees' lush falsettos, or KC and the Sunshine Band's joyful, up-tempo takes on trivial subject matter. This is light-hearted fare, great to get people on their feet and dancing. Be sure you alternate with other good dance music as these beats are hypnotic.
Swing, like Benny Goodman, the Harry James band, Arte Shaw, and others is a great classic that alternates well at dance parties with disco stuff. These are mostly Big Bands - sort of modern orchestras featuring lots of horns, brass and woodwinds (try Louis Prima's Sing Sing Sing - swingin', daddy-o!). Or you can go new retro with Brian Setzer's Orchestra or the Squirrel Nut Zippers; the main difference is that the newer versions feature electric guitars as or more prominently than the brass and winds.
Standards - these old-school gems are being rediscovered and valued for their wonderful, romantic lyrics and sweet, strong vocal melodies, which can be accompanied by simple piano or acoustic guitar arrangements. Try these out by yourself first - your friends may not understand. Tony Bennett, Doris Day, Judy Garland, and Frank Sinatra all set the world on fire back in the day with songs like You Made Me Love You, Paper Moon, Swanee, and Black Magic. New artists working in this genre include Michael Bublé and Jason Mraz.

Jazz is complicated. Mostly instrumental, it comes in flavors. Most jazz features saxophones or pianos, rarely guitars. There's all-instrumental jazz that really is best appreciated alone or with a friend who understands it as you do. There is no discernible beat or melody, and it's a struggle for the average listener to relax when listening. This music is best appreciated by true aficionados, most people will find the music too atonal to latch onto well. Then there's so-called New Age Jazz or Smooth Jazz, which includes artists such as Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald, Dave Koz or George Benson. Much easier listening - most friends will like it. It's nice for small, intimate gatherings.
There are also recording artists whose music doesn't really fall into easily identified, comfortable categories. Josh Groban sings American pop songs in English, but also chooses unusual works in Italian, French and Spanish, in a much more classical vein. Norah Jones can be seen as a smooth jazz artist in one song, a pop artist in another. And what would we call Weird Al Yankovic? Is he a comedian, or a singer? As mentioned in the first paragraph, context is everything, and in the right environment, one can appreciate all sorts of musical endeavours and artists.

Ask basic questions.,
Look for affordable classics.,
Start with the heavyweight champions of jazz.,
Follow the artists that show up as sidemen.,
Talk about jazz with jazz geeks.",How to Start a Jazz Collection," The first thing to do is figure out what you do know by asking yourself some questions:


What sort of jazz, if any, have you heard?
Have you heard any specific jazz CDs or artists that you really liked?
Are there certain instruments that you really like?
Is there a tempo or style that you prefer?
Is there any jazz you have heard that you don’t like?
Do you like instrumental, or vocal, or both?
Do you only like a certain sub-genre of jazz?;
, If you love getting a lot of bang for your buck with music, there are lots of ways to do that in the jazz genre. Consult the suggestions below and keep these points in mind:


First off, ask your local record store geek about cheap new classic jazz CDs. There are an amazing amount of deals. In fact, there are so many cheap classics out there, it becomes hard to recommend the more expensive contemporary jazz artists.
Second, buy used jazz. The availability of used jazz CDs can depend on the kind of neighborhood you live in (and the residing musical taste). If you are lucky enough to live amongst jazz lovers, used jazz CDS are cheap and guaranteed.
Finally, think about investing in a turntable. If you want to talk about getting affordable classics in any genre, you can always find some great deals on vinyl. This is especially true if you don’t mind looking through a store's “bargain basement” used stuff.

, Coltrane, Miles, Bird, Louie, Billie. If you have heard of them, there’s probably a reason. So ask your questions, figure out what you like, do your homework, and then start obvious. You can get cooler and more diverse as you go. As it is, the classics are usually about as cool as cool comes anyway, and in most cases, they are cheap.

, Play ""jazz geography"". Jazz musicians tend to play with many different bands and the big bands were virtual jazz incubators. Once you hear Count Basie with Sinatra, try Basie with saxophonist Lester Young. Another example: Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue (which, by the way, is a good choice if you're a classical music enthusiast)--the guys who play on it are all heavyweight champs in their own right. Coltrane on tenor; Cannonball Adderley on Alto; Bill Evans on piano… even jazz rookies have heard of those guys. Once you hear the sax boys soloing on that album, and you read the liner notes (which is essential on Kind of Blue), you are going to want to get Cannonball’s Somethin’ Else or Everybody Loves Bill Evans. The next thing you know - you’ve got a collection.

, Someone who's passionate about jazz will play stuff for you… and ask tons of questions… and get to the bottom of your jazz needs. Then they will set you up. Find the indie record store in your area and start a conversation with a jazz fanatic. Be ready with your answers to the questions you asked yourself earlier.

,, How available is the record? If millions were initially sold, it is likely that many will turn up in thrift shops, used record stores, and many homes. The scarcity factor must be present. There must be a demand for that record because of the artists performing (for example, a major talent who died young, before being able to make many records), the label on which it was recorded (the original recording as distinguished from a ""reissue""), or an oddity concerning the record (for example, a V-disc, wartime government recording, an air-check taken from a radio broadcast, an original picture disc, or a 10-inch LP). The scarcity factor can also be affected by whether a record is ""out-of-print"" (no longer available from the manufacturer), thereby decreasing the supply. ""Bootlegs"" (records illegally produced from live concerts or broadcasts) are also valuable to collectors., If it is in ""mint"" condition (perfect) or ""near mint"" condition, it will have the highest possible value. A record in ""very good"" condition should not have any distorted sounds or loss of sound quality. ""Good"" means it may have some imperfections, but can be readily enjoyed. ""Fair"" means it can play, but it will have obvious sound impairment and detract from your enjoyment and the value of the record. Those with surface noise and scratches will be of little or no value. Some dealers may have a slightly different grading scale., Generally speaking, there is more interest in music than in spoken word or comedy records and the value would therefore be greater. Certain kinds of musical recordings bring high sales prices. Jazz records and original Broadway cast and movie soundtracks tend to provide a more active market and greater value. Also, early rhythm and blues records and the doo wop sound are highly valued and collectible. Among classical records, the most valuable are orchestral performances, then solo instrumental, chamber music and concertos, solo vocal and operatic arias, and finally, complete operas. To some collectors, whether a record is mono or stereo affects the value. See the Tips below for emerging trends., Records are purchased by collectors, mail order dealers, used records stores, and the general public (sometimes on a nostalgic impulse or because of a favorite artist. Also, some audiophiles believe the sound quality produced by vinyl is greater than that of a CD or other media format). For truly rare records, the best prices will come from dealers who know the market and how much they can resell them for. Collectors are emotional and sometimes fanatical about collecting their specialties. They may pay top prices for particular idiosyncrasies. It is unusual to get top dollar for a rare record from the ""general public,"" where only the performance value is recognized, not the resale or trading value., Painstaking research along with knowledge of the record industry and its artists is required to determine the value of a particular recording. It may be possible to determine a value for a ""rare"" record once you have determined that it is truly rare.

Finally, do what you can to push the genre ahead.",How to Appreciate Authentic Death or Black Metal," Look into the classics of the genre first: Morbid Angel's ""Blessed are the Sick,"" Deicide's ""Legion,"" Obituary's ""Cause of Death,"" and Amorphis' ""the Karelian Isthmus"" should get you started with death metal. Some black metal classics include: Burzum's ""Hvis Lyset Tar Oss,"" Darkthrone's ""Under a Funeral Moon,"" Emperor's ""In the Nightside Eclipse,"" and Mayhem's ""De Mysterious Dom Sathanas."";
, This is the most important, yet oft-neglected step of all. Metal is not background music - it is structurally (and at times, technically) complex music - don't expect to hear the hooks and melodies present in 99.99% of popular music. Analyze the music and learn to tell the difference between quality art and vapid crap. Few artists belong to the former category, but these are the ones that are worth your time.

, Read reviews and interviews, and learn about the history of the genre. Find out why and how your favorite releases came to be, and what influenced your favorite artists. Learn about why an album is contextually important. A great place to start is the Dark Legions Archive, at http://www.anus.com/metal. Consult the sections on Philosophy, History, and Styles first. Make sure to bring a dictionary., Listen thoroughly, at different days, not five times in one sitting. It's really important. Your mind will gradually become acquainted with the narration, structure, and melodies of the music. Only then can a full appreciation of the spirit of Metal come to realization.

, They're really not that bad - in fact, some metal lyrics are surprisingly literate, such as those penned by Nile, Emperor, Absu, and Shining. If a CD doesn't come with lyrics, look them up on http://www.darklyrics.com.

, Many bands take direct influence from Classical / Romanticist composers such as W.A. Mozart, Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Richard Wagner, and Edvard Grieg. Others borrow from neoclassical groups like King Crimson, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, and Vangelis. Some bands were inspired by the world of literature as well: Bathory and Gorgoroth were avid readers of Nietzsche. As well, metal is deeply connected with other genres such as hardcore punk (Napalm Death), ambient (Burzum), and industrial music (Godflesh).

, You don't have to grab everything you can get your hands on (in fact you shouldn't), and you don't have to be a collector either - but buying albums helps the genre to live by demonstrating public interest in the music. Only buy releases of known quality - try to listen to the album several times before you purchase it.

, Whether you have long hair or not is of little importance in the long run. However, wearing an Immortal or Autopsy shirt in a public place is a good way to meet other Metalheads, and also a good way to shove the reality of metal and its message into the consciousness of the sheep-like public.

, Whether an album is technically simple or complex; whether it was recorded in a basement or in a professional studio does not matter - context, composition and artistic content do.

, There is no underground when any band can get thousands of fans overnight just by having a page on Myspace.com. Most so-called ""underground"" music is imitation - not innovation.

, Sounds out of place, but think about it - spend two decades with drugs, alcohol, fast food, TV, and loud music, and you won't be able to tell the difference between Burzum and Britney.

, Metal's not quite finished yet - there are still new directions to explore and new techniques to employ. If you are a musician - stick with what you do, but don't rush. Make sure your music is of (very) high quality before even thinking about releasing anything. We don't need anymore bedroom black metal or tech-metalcore bands - these aren't worth the plastic cases their CDs come in. If you are not a musician, do what you can to promote quality metal - join a message board and talk about the bands that matter and why they're important.

Ask your child about their favorite band.,
Do some background research yourself.,
Once you have learned the name of the band and its songs, try listening to a few.,
Look to the internet for news and updates on this band.,
Put your knowledge to use!,
Learn the name of the band your friends are interested in.,
If you are comfortable doing so, ask around.,
Head to the internet.,
Use your new knowledge, whether it's to chat with a friend or to find common ground with a crush.",How to Stay Knowledgeable About a Teen's Favorite Band," Depending on your relationship, they may be surprisingly eager to discuss the members of the band, tours, concerts, lyrics, and more. Asking shows that you care about their life and that you want to be a part of it.;
, Should your child not want to talk, find the names of songs or bands that your child likes. Posters, t-shirts, and other similar public ways of showing their affinity for a certain band can make this process easy. Do not, however, invade their privacy to learn about their life. Staying knowledgeable about a teen's favorite band is a way to connect with them, rather than have them draw away from you.

, Regardless of your taste, keep alert to the fact that the music itself is often an important part of a teen's life. Do not disregard their music just because it doesn't fit your personal choice.

, A simple online search can lead you to descriptions, articles, and concert schedules for almost any group. With extremely popular bands, however, be careful; not all information will be factual.

, Talk to your teen, take them to a concert, or just mention a bit of news regarding the band. Music is a fantastic way to bond, especially during the difficult period of adolescence.

, This can involve asking the friend/intended about it, or simply noticing the music they listen to and talk about.

, Many teens will likely know about the band as well, especially within the group of friends of the individual. Don't be afraid to ask––most people love to talk about their favorite music!

, Look into band members, news, concerts, and videos of performances. Listen to the music, and learn what you can.

, Either way, music is a key element in almost every teen's life.

Know the schedule.,
Be prepared.,
Be organized.,
Sit with good posture.,
Pay attention.,
Take advantage of breaks.,
Be friendly.,
Do your best to have fun.,
Enjoy your free time.,
After the rehearsal, go home and take a nap, eat a snack, or just sit and do nothing.",How to Survive a Long Band Rehearsal," Be sure that you know when practice starts, when it ends, and if you'll have breaks (and for how long). If the practice isn't at your school (perhaps it's an honor band that will only practice a few times and must meet in a central location), make sure to know where it'll be, how far in advance you need to leave, and when you'll need to be picked up. This will help you plan meals, snacks, and give you an idea of how long you'll have to play at one time.;
, A good checklist of items to be sure to have would include:


Comfortable clothing. Don't wear your itchiest sweater, most uncomfortable pants, or shoes that you absolutely can't stand. This goes double if you'll be marching... constantly itching or hurting all through the rehearsal will wreck your concentration and the experience.
Your music or a folder to put new music in. Even if you don't have sheet music for this group yet, you'll want something to put it in to get it home safely.
A pencil. You never know when you'll need to mark your music, and carrying a pencil isn't a bad habit to get into.
A spit rag/small towel. Even if you play a small wind instrument such as the clarinet, it may start dripping spit after a few hours of playing. The last thing you want is to end up sitting in it.
Extras of everything you may need. This would include reeds, valve oil, cork grease, and other things of that nature. Be sure to have them within easy reach, but not cluttering up the area.
A water bottle. You'll want to make sure this is allowed first, as different band rooms have different rules regarding food and drinks, but if you can bring one, you definitely should. You're going to get incredibly thirsty from blowing into your instrument so much. If you know you'll get a snack break, bring a snack too, and don't bring anything with unearthly amounts of salt or sugar, or it will be blown into your instrument once you start playing again. Yuck.


, If you already have your music, make sure it's in order, together, and all there. Write your name on it if it is allowed, so you can find it if it's dropped. If you plan to be getting music, leave some space in your folder, and make sure to put it in there as you get it, to avoid losing anything.

, While you may think the effort needed to sit up straight and hold your arms right will wear you out earlier, it actually won't. You should be in this habit anyway, but a good body position will ultimately make you more comfortable and your hands and back won't get tired as quickly.

, The worst part of band rehearsals, especially with difficult music, can be repeating a few measures over and over and over again. Do your best to look alert, listen to the director when he/she talks to you or your section, and try to do what they ask the first time.

, If you get a whole break in the rehearsal, make sure you take care of important things like getting to the bathroom (especially if the whole band needs to go... you want to hurry up and make a break for it!), getting some water, or eating your snack before you start talking to your friends or doing other things. You'll regret it if the break is over and you were so busy goofing off that you didn't get these things done. If you have a few minutes while the director is talking to another section, take the time to lean back in your chair, mark your music, change your reed, empty your spit valve, or anything else you may have to do. Keep an ear on what's going on, though... you don't want to miss your turn to play!

, If you're in a band with people you don't know, or you got stuck sitting next to someone you don't particularly like, be as nice to them as possible (or at least be civil). Drama doesn't make long practices any better, and will often distract you or stress you out.

, If you're completely, utterly miserable from the second you walk in the door to the second you leave, maybe band really isn't for you. People who are really devoted to their instrument and the band can enjoy even the most grueling of rehearsals. Sure, they may not be grinning like maniacs the whole time, but they probably aren't thinking ""Darn, I wish I'd never even auditioned for this stupid band.""

, Along with lunch, or just as an opportunity for fresh air, you may be allowed some time outside or elsewhere in the building to run around and talk to your friends. Let this be a chance to refresh your mood, too, and when you get back to the band room, you'll be awake, alert, and ready to play some more.

, Hooray, you survived! After a little doze, you'll be as good as new!

Prepare the equipment.,
Review the stage.,
Set up on stage.,
Practice as needed.,
Stay relaxed and focused.,
Play certain material.,
Interact with the audience.,
Wrap up the set.,
Recollect yourself.",How to Play Live," Get all your gear in order and ready to take to the show. If you need your gear for something like practice, only leave out essential equipment, such as a parts of a drum kit. Do this well in advanced of your show time to limit the amount of mistakes taken.;
, Check the stage for room for instruments, practice and preparation rooms if necessary, restrooms, and also zones for tech places. These zones are for any tech people or ""roadies"" which may include band mates and yourself so that you are anyone else can fix or prep any equipment. Many times your equipment can and will fail, so with these zones they are are out of the way and out of sight. Tech rooms are optional and are recommended for any show playing more than four musical numbers. You want to make sure you know where everything is, so there are no surprises later on.

, If you are able to, set up all of your gear on stage and near the sides, including any tech zones in the week's days before the event at the latest to see if everything can be placed effectively. If not, keep your drums in the same position and roll out any needed equipment onto the stage, this is only necessary if for example you are playing battle of the bands or a talent show.

, In your practice space you may think you sound perfect, but rarely does such an occasion happen on stage. You may need to practice with each other to see what needs adjusted. Have someone go out into the audience section and listen to a song and have them tell you what it sounds like.

, Gigging is a stressful experience towards you and your band mates, it would be beneficial for you to keep everything moving smoothly and not lose your temper including other members. Stay the same way during the event, if a mistake happens roll with it and act as if nothing happened.

, When you're playing more than four pieces throw in a cover song or two that the crowd would enjoy, for example if you are a metal oriented band and play a five song set list, throw in a Pantera cover and maybe an end cover song to say goodnight. Always expect an encore and have two songs prepared.

, Do something with the crowd that will entertain them when you have extra time, or a member is setting up. You could do a drum solo but many times people will come back to see the band if you said something funny or did something entertaining during the song transitions. Be aware that a certain vibe exists in each audience you play for. Bigger bands such as Slipknot, Of Mice and Men, Three Days Grace, etc have crowds that expect different things. With Slipknot, you may find DJ Sid Wilson urinating on Clown's empty beer kegs while on the other hand it's a totally different story with Of Mice and Men.

, Play a song that was written by the band as a one-piece and maybe an end song or encore, however if you you think you should play a cover for the last song then by all means do it. The reason why you're there is to entertain, if a cover entertains more than an original piece play it, it may give you another reason to play live again.

, Unfortunately, you may not have this chance if you are touring. Do whatever it is you need to do to temporarily become a non-entertainer again. This means that if you were wearing some sort of stage paint, wash it off, get clean and ready for the next show. Don't forget to collect any profit you made and your gear.

Be prepared for a worst case scenario, in case something happens.",How to Prepare for Your Band's First Tour," Assuming this is your band's first tour, you’ll probably be going out for just a few weeks. Get all the band members to make a list of everything they will require in that time, including things such as deodorant. You’ll need to find space for instruments, personal belongings, any merchandise or other items, and your band. By knowing what you are taking with you, you can find ways to conserve space.;
, Invest in personal hygiene items, as you may not have access to showers and such as much as you normally would. You should also consider ensuring that your hairstyle is easy to manage. You will have to make some sacrifices to ensure that everyone has everything they absolutely need.

, You should know exactly where you have to be and when.

, You will need cash for hotel rooms when available, food and water/drinks, gas, and any other needs. You should also save some for emergencies, so that you aren't penniless if you run out of something or have problems with your transportation.

, You should look for things with distant expiration dates, and possibly take along some vitamins.

, T-shirts and/or sweatshirts, pajamas, anything you'll be able to wear for extended amounts of time without discomfort. You can, of course, bring along some nicer outfits, but be sure everything you have is appropriate for the conditions and temperatures you'll be in.

,, Books, notebooks or drawing pads, tablets, iPods, etc. Nothing too large, of course, since you'll have limited space, but you should all have something with you to prevent boredom during the drive.

,, You can house some of your stuff in it, and it will allow more space in the van or car.

, It's going to be a pain to have to go back and get things, and it can be embarrassing to admit you forgot something major.

Be aware that brass instruments come in many sizes, depending on the instrument.,
Begin your marching practice in a space with a relatively flat surface, such as a gym or a good parking lot.,
Start playing the music.,
Add the march.,
Think about how your instrument sounds while you're marching and playing.,
Think about showmanship!",How to March While Playing a Brass Instrument," The size affects the ease of mobility. Trumpets and tubas take different amounts of strength and coordination while locomoting. Some instruments are very difficult to play while marching, however-- French horns are particularly tricky, as they are meant to rest on a leg (thigh) for support while seated in a chair. Band directors often will allow French horn players to use a different instrument during marching band exercises, such as drums or some other percussion instrument. But other instruments can be played with ease if a player is willing to practice moving while playing.
, Prepare to have your lips bumped by the instrument's mouthpiece when you begin to practice marching while playing. It's all a matter of learning to use your arms to control and support the position of your instrument. Arm strength is something you may want to work on with various exercises. But if you practice with your instrument a lot, you'll get a workout anyway., With your sheet music loaded in the holder of your instrument (if your band director is allowing you to use it), begin playing and walking slowly to get the feel for what you'll need to do., When you feel a bit more coordinated, begin to use a marching step while playing your instrument. Again, this is best done on a relatively flat surface in the beginning. If you're only going to march on a football field, you'll always have a flat surface. But if your marching band participates in street parades, you may find that the streets are uneven and have a pothole here and there. This takes more practice to accommodate the unevenness, but it can be done!, Is the sound your instrument produces weak or out-of-tune? This is common in the beginning. You have to get your lips used to a mouthpiece that wants to move with your body. This is why arm strength is important to acquire, so you can keep your brass instrument and mouthpiece in the same place most of the time., Your band director will want the entire group to look polished. Keep your instrument clean and polished. Keep your uniform clean and pressed. Try to show some energy in your performance––don't look as though you're sleepwalking through it. Give the audience a reason to applaud, and you'll go home feeling like you made their day!"
"
Practice the music.,
Recognize phrases.,
Begin repeating the last part of the song.,
The length of each section depends on how well you know your memory to have been in the past; if you know you remember things well, extend the length, but if you're forgetful, make it shorter, even if it's just a phrase or two.,
Play it once from memory with eyes closed.,
Look at the music again.,
Play it again without looking at the music.,
Even after it is memorized, it helps to continue looking at the music in alternate cycles.,
Move onto a different chunk.,
Link the two chunks together.,
Continue this process until you have memorized the song.

,
Start at the end and play the last measure, play it by memory, go on to the second to last measure, and repeat the process till you can play the whole song.

,
Use a metronome while practicing and learn to count the measures of rests, you don't want to be the one person who plays during a rest.

,
Sing the music you're trying to memorize.",How to Memorize Sheet Music," You obviously won't be able to memorize your music when you don't even know how to play it!;
, This will not only give you a better understanding of the music, but when it comes time to actually start memorizing it, it will be easier to divide it up. Most phrases are four to eight measures.

, The music will be more secure in your memory if you learn it from the end toward the beginning than if you learn the beginning first.

, Keep reading off the music at this point.

, Go as far as you can.

, Find what you did right and what you did wrong. If you need to, play something that you missed.

, Continue to alternate between eyes closed and eyes open until you know the piece well.

, This not only secures your memory, but also helps to minimize the chance you might habituate yourself to a wrong note.

, This will, again, depend on your memory. Repeat the process you used with the first chunk, but play this chunk by itself.

, Play from measure one to however far you memorized. Keep repeating this until you can play it from memory five times in a row.

,,,, Don't be embarrassed to sing or hum it, because the more familiar you are with the music, the easier memorizing it would be.

Know protocol and unwritten rules.,
Know what you're getting into.,
Wear the right gear.,
Brace yourself.,
Watch and observe from the side.,
Participate on the side line by pushing people back in the pit and embracing mosh pit kids from falling as they circulate the rim.,
Circle the circle pit.,
Open up the pit.,
Switch things up.",How to Mosh in a Mosh Pit," While it may seem otherwise, moshing is by no means a way to hurt someone. Moshing is about releasing aggression, and having fun while enjoying some awesome music. The 'rules' are mainly common sense.


No karate in the pit - Many newcomers to moshing tend to start flailing their arms and/or feet around, especially in the 'core scene. This is an easy way to hurt someone, and ruins the fun for everyone around you. Don't do it.
Falling - Lift that person back up and make sure they are not hurt. They will probably just laugh and thank you before joining back in or stepping out if they are hurt. This could possibly be the most important rule of all, you must pick up a falling mosher at all times.
Copping a feel - It's wrong. Don't do it. Every female mosher isn't a groupie and if she doesn't get revenge on you, the guy beside you will get it. Not only is it wrong, it's very disturbing to a girl. But, it does happen, and if it does, call out whoever did it. More respectful moshers will usually push him away, or get between you and him.
Hitting - It's not a fight! If you hurt someone it is etiquette to maybe shake their hand or clap their shoulder. Do a friendly gesture and apologize (flashing the 'horns' and mouthing an apology over the music works). Also bear in mind that if you start a fight, you will be surrounded and greatly outnumbered.
The Pull out - When you're standing around an extremely violent/large pit watching the action and you see someone trying unsuccessfully to get out of the pit, if you think you can handle the pit, go and get them. It's always appreciated.
The Lift Up - If someone is hurt but no one will move to let them out of the crowd (which is common at larger festival pit and crowds), ask the people around you to lift the person up and body surf them to the front so security can help them out. Make sure to ask if it's okay first though as getting lifted freaks some people out at first.
Don't Be The Jerk. People on the sidelines are on the sidelines for a reason...They Don't want to mosh right now. Of course some will very soon others don't. Don't force anyone to mosh by grabbing them and throwing them in to the pit if they really don't want to. Sometimes this is a great way to start a pit but if a pit is already going and someone's on the sideline don't force it. Also if they are holding a fist out in front of them they don't even want to be touched.;
, Be objective and recognize that you may get hurt, and you're definitely going to get covered in sweat (and maybe even saliva or blood) of complete strangers. While the objective of a mosh pit is to make physical contact without getting hurt, there is a good degree of unpredictability and risk. Much of the risk comes from the type of music playing. Ska will be more relaxed, while metal and some punk will be rougher. If you're considering making your debut in a mosh pit, be aware of the potential consequences and make sure that they're worth the thrill.

, Wear clothes that you don't mind getting stained or even ruined. Your outfit should also be comfortable and light, since it will get hot in the pit.


Make sure your shoes fit tightly and lace them well, because if a shoe falls off, you'll have a hard time getting it back and your unprotected foot will suffer in the meantime. Boots or chucks are recommended.
Remove any spiked wristbands or other dangerous accessories, as they could injure a fellow mosher (or even yourself). Avoid anything that can be grabbed (i.e. chains, chained wallets, long necklaces and dangling earrings). Unusual and easily injured piercings may look cool, but will be a liability in the pit.
Never take bags or backpacks into the pit as they are a liability to you and the people around you. Give any loose articles to a trustworthy friend. Do not keep anything in your pockets in a pit! They will most likely fall out.
If you can see reasonably well without your glasses, take them off and leave them with a friend who is not moshing. Better yet, wear contacts to the show.
Your shirt will most likely be grabbed and pulled, so it is best to get a shirt with good coverage. If you are female, it is best to wear a sleeved shirt, not a tank top.

, Whether in the mosh pit or out, you need to keep your hands and more specifically, your arms prepared. Don't look like you're ready to strike someone, but certainly don't put yourself in a position where your hands are going to be stuck to your sides, you may accidentally get your face knocked by someone's skull flying at you and you weren't ready for it.

, How brutal are the individuals bouncing around this particular pit? Are people just having fun, or are they going for blood? Know the difference between those who are ""slam dancing"" and the idiot high school jock who's running around smashing people in the face with his knuckles. There are many different types of moshing, and adapting to these is an important step if you want to enjoy it.

, There are going to be people flying back and forth, side to side, up and down and all over the place.

, You're going to continue pushing, bouncing, and slamming off of other people in the pit. Eventually you're going to be able to control your direction and choose your hits, maybe even on your first night. Go at the speed of the crowd. Watch out for pauses, though. Typically, all moshers who know when a pause in the song is coming will clear the pit and start after the pause. Be sure to either know the music or be ready for pauses to occur if you don't know how to mosh yet.


The dropper (or breakdown) is the violent outburst that many metal, hardcore, alternative bands, punk rock, and similar types of music have that goes from normal lyrical music to a crashing point which will set off the adrenaline of every kid around you and is virtually the ""go"" sound or green light that it is time to smash and slam again. If you're unfamiliar with the music, this is going to be hard to spot, but if you see it coming, you won't be caught off guard by the sudden outburst.

, Sometimes mosh pits occur in very crowded places. When this happens, there will be a natural tendency of the crowd to push the outer rim of the pit towards the center. Eventually this will close the pit unless the crowd is continually pushed back. Seasoned moshers will typically counteract this by launching themselves into the sides of the pit in various ways. Basically, if the people on the cusp of the pit have more incentive to stay out of your way than to let the crowd push them into the pit, the pit will stay open. Some strategies for doing this include...


""Crack back"" by having several people lean back onto the walls of the pit with their arms outstretched
""Cluster"" a bunch of people with their arms over each others' shoulders and have them bounce around the walls of the pit
""Slingshot"" into the sides by using another person's momentum to launch you.
""Circle pit"" by creating a whirlpool of people running around the outside of the pit.
Anything that involves flailing limbs that looks like it will hurt if someone gets too close. There are numerous hardcore dances that can facilitate this. Look to the crowd for inspiration.

,


Pogoing. Basically just jumping up and down, usually at punk shows.
The Cyclone. Cross your arms over your chest to form an ""x"" and clasp hands with a fellow mosher in the same position, facing you. Then spin around each other, using your weight to gain momentum. This is a good way of widening a small pit or making space to perform further moves in a crowded pit. You can let go when you are spinning fast, but this will likely result in a hard landing and possible injury, or slamming into and thus annoying another mosher.
Stage dive. Push your way past the crowd and the bouncers if you can so that you can get on stage. Without disrupting the band or any of their equipment, dive into the crowd (make sure they see you coming) and tense up when you land so that you're easier to catch. Be warned: Many venues will eject you from the concert for stage diving. Make sure you know the rules of the club.

Crowd surf. You can start off either by stage diving or by hoisting yourself up on two (taller) people's shoulders. Having somebody lift you up by the foot with their hands is risky because odds are, the people around you won't have enough time to see you coming and somebody (including but not limited to you) will get hurt, extremely hurt! If you do get boosted make sure the people around you see you coming before you actually land on them.
The anaconda - a two person move that is best done with lots of space. Put one person's legs around the other person's waist so that their hands are on the ground and legs elevated. The standing person holds on to their quads and lifts bringing their entire torso up. The person with their hands on the ground should push up to help the lifting person. Doing this repeatedly is a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.

Be consistent once you’ve decided on a particular vibe and treatment.Your chosen theme and album vibe should have continuity across the board.,
Create your own artwork whenever possible.",How to Make a Good Album," Your approach to an album theme can be as loose or elaborate as you like, but some kind of theme is necessary to make your album cohesive.It can be as simple as creating a lyrical theme that fuses the songs together, or you can go all out with a deep-rooted concept album that tells a story through song.


For example, a loose theme could focus on a specific emotion, one of the four elements, a particular event that affected you or your own social commentary.To get an idea of how concept albums work, reference The Wall by Pink Floyd, Mothership Connection by Parliament, Pet Sounds by Beach Boys, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars by David Bowie, The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra by Sun Ra, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by Public Enemy and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles.Before you start writing songs, spend some time reflecting. Keep a journal and write down your thoughts and ideas as they come to you.;
, Chances are, you have songs written that you haven’t done anything with yet. Look closely at those songs – are there any connecting lyrical or melodic themes? Are they strong enough to build your album on?


At the very least, these songs might inspire new ideas, or jumpstart a concept you already have in mind.
Consider already-written material for your album. Work on building a repertoire of solid songs that you don’t necessarily have a plan for yet.

, During the writing phase, don’t aim for perfection or fully realized songs. You can perfect the songs later. For now, explore ideas and make room for inspiration to strike. As you work on the songs, also work toward developing your own unique sound.


Inspiration can come at any time, so be prepared. Carry a pen and notebook with you everywhere. Use a voice recorder app on your phone to capture lyric or melody ideas on the fly.Don’t try to force the songs. If you get stuck on one, put that song away and start work on another one. You can come back to it later with fresh eyes and ears., Organize specific times for practicing and stick to that schedule as closely as you can. Consistent practicing will help you hone your craft.You’ll also get more comfortable with your material and your new songs will fully develop. Take note of any changes or variations that happen spontaneously while you’re practicing.


Think about why these variations might be happening. Do you need to rehearse more to work that kink out, or should that change be incorporated into the song?
Don’t be afraid to change your songs based on what comes out naturally while you’re practicing. Allow them to develop organically.

, Pay attention to their reactions and get feedback from trustworthy people in the crowd.


Use gigs as opportunities to improve and refine your songs.

, If you are the front person or the main songwriter of a band, it can be difficult to relinquish full control. However, you have to give your bandmates room to interpret your vision while still putting their unique spin on the sound. Allow room for their creative juices to flow.


Respect the suggestions and input of your bandmates. The songs will be better for it.

, After honing in on what you envision as the thematic heart of your album, explore your concept more deeply by writing even more songs. In general, most completed albums range from 8 to 12 tracks, so try to write around 20 songs.If 20 seems like too many, just aim to write as many songs as you can.
Having an excess of material will allow you to literally craft your album by going through a process of elimination once you’re in the final stages., As you narrow down the final tracks, think of the album as sculpture.Carve away the songs that don't fit your concept. Don’t focus on choosing what you perceive to be the obvious “singles” – include a wide range of songs.


Contrast is important to maintain a listener’s attention.
Produce only the best of your music. Choose the songs that truly showcase your musical talent.

, Track sequencing has always been important, but in today’s digital music market, it’s even more so. Research has shown that the earlier a track appears on a record, the more likely a consumer is to listen to it.The first song in particular is crucial, since it sets the tone for the entire piece.


If you’re working with a very particular theme or concept, try to create a narrative framework. It might help to imagine that you’re composing the music for a film.If you aren’t trying to tell a literal story, think more in terms of grouping songs together in chunks that relate to one another in a way that makes sense to you.
Even if your concept/theme is more on the ambiguous side, you still want the album to be as cohesive as possible.

, At this point you probably already have a working title in mind, but it’s best to wait until the entire thing is compiled before committing to one. Choose a title that conveys the theme/concept you’ve been working toward. Go through your lyrics and see if anything jumps out at you as being title material.


Bands often use the title of one of the songs as the album title. If you decide to go this route, choose the song that best exemplifies the theme or mood of your album.
Another popular choice is to self-title the record, especially if it’s a debut album. To self-title means to make your band’s name the record title.
Consider this if you feel that the album’s themes encapsulate what your band is fundamentally all about.

, Studios usually charge by the hour and they are not cheap. Because of this, make sure that you’ve rehearsed the studio versions of your new songs until you have them down cold. Do as much pre-production on the album as you possibly can before hitting the studio.Figure out the BPM of each song before you go into the studio. This will help you avoid wasting valuable studio time figuring out tempos.
If you have fellow band members, make sure everyone has rehearsed. Ask everyone to tune and prep their instruments before going into the studio.If you are self-recording your record at home, this is still a good rule of thumb. Before you sit down to record a single note, do all of the pre-production for your record.

, Everyone should put away their cell phones and come into the studio ready to focus on recording the songs. Make sure the room is comfortable enough to spend large chunks of time in.Limit (or even prohibit) visits from friends, family and significant others.


Remember to take frequent breaks to avoid over-exerting yourself. You want to keep your mind sharp. Step outside for a few minutes every hour or so for a breather.
Avoid using drugs and/or alcohol in the studio. Abusing substances is a very popular musician cliché, but you run the risk of wasting studio time and negatively affecting your ability to play the songs., It’s good to go into the studio with high expectations, but don’t hinder yourself by establishing goals that don’t make sense. Even the simplest of songs should take you about 1-2 hours to record, not counting set up time.Expect overdubs to take about 1 hour per song.


Book your studio hours based on the above estimations. You may want to even give yourself a little extra time on top of that.
It’s better to work with a slight excess of time rather than not enough.
Otherwise, you’ll stress yourself out by rushing to finish, and may end up with recordings that you aren’t proud of.

, Get a list of what gear the studio has to offer before you go in and have a discussion with the engineer about what sound you are going for. The most important aspect is tracking the drums, since they are the hardest to get right in a recording. If you are short on cash, book studio time just for drum tracking. The rest can be done at a home studio with software like Pro Tools or Logic, especially if your band already owns decent gear and you have some quality microphones.To record good vocals, all you really need is a quality mic and an isolation booth. If money is an issue, vocals can definitely be recorded outside of an expensive studio.
Use the talents of your friends whenever possible. As a musician, you probably know people who have engineering talents and home studios., You need to listen to the recordings with a critical ear, but try to step back and be as objective as possible. It is not uncommon for musicians to over analyze the smallest of details in the studio and then tweak their recordings until they sound completely sterile.


You want the songs to sound good, but you also want to preserve their original creativity. Overuse of studio equipment has a way of sanitizing recordings to a fault.
It might help to bring some trusted friends in, after the majority of the recording is completed, to get fresh ears on the recordings.

, Cover art is often the final piece of the puzzle – the visual representation of what the album sounds like. The artwork can pull together your theme and add to the cohesiveness of the songs. It’s also crucial because it’s the first interaction most potential buyers will have with the album.


Create or choose powerful images that represent your songs. Keep your album’s theme and overall mood in mind.
You want the artwork to be eye-catching, but it should also epitomize your album’s theme., The colors used in the artwork are just as important as the images themselves, so develop a color theme that reflects the album’s emotions.It wouldn’t make sense to record a bleak record about the death of a loved one and then put a pink and yellow cover on it. Conversely, a jubilant-sounding album shouldn’t have artwork that is mostly black or gray.Inspect the artwork of some of your favorite albums for inspiration.
Think about how the color choices on those album covers relate to the emotion of the records.

, This includes even the font choices and your band’s logo (if you have one). The idea is to present a complete package – a fully realized piece of art.


The more uniform your complete album package is, the easier it is for people to remember.
Keep consistency in mind even when it comes to your band’s merchandise, website, etc.
For example, a somber album shouldn’t be paired with a pink band t-shirt.

, When it comes to your album, you are the expert. You know it inside and out. If you aren’t artistic in this way, try to work up a loose initial design in Photoshop or on paper before handing it off to more capable hands. At the very least, have a solid idea of what you are trying to achieve with the artwork before having someone else design it.


Be protective of your vision, but also leave a little room for the artist to be creative.Make sure the final design has a high quality digital file that goes with it.
When the artwork goes to print, the highest resolution possible is needed to ensure the final product looks solid and professional.

Decide what sort of music you'll offer critiques on.,
Form an opinion before saying it out loud.,
Refrain from presenting yourself as an expert on playing techniques.,
Use your knowledge of similar music.,
Do your homework.,
Trust your own memory.,
Encourage others to discuss the music with you.,
Recommend your favorites to everyone.",How to Critique Music if You Are Not a Musician," You don't have to pigeonhole yourself, but you do need to make a set of parameters for yourself: Will you critique classical music? Rock and roll? Jazz? Folk? Metal? There are some bloggers who have ""listening blogs"" - they listen to a variety of music, post links to it, and then comment on it. They don't have a set type of music they listen to. There are others who are known for being classical music critics, rock critics, and so on. All you have to do is say what you intend to critique: Rock? Jazz? Film scores? Everything?;
, Refrain from talking off the top of your head as you listen. Your critique might change as you get deeper into the recording. Wait until you have listened carefully to the entire recording, and think about it. Once you've let the ideas percolate a bit, you'll be better able to articulate them.

, Since you aren't a musician yourself, it's probably best if you make sure you frame any reference to the musician's skill or talent as your opinion, only. Those who would like to disqualify your opinion because you aren't a musician will pounce on statements like ""he's not that good a player."" Instead, use phrases like, ""Personally, I like the way Van Halen plays better, but this guy does as well as he can.""

, Draw comparisons between bands or musical styles when you hear the similarities. Doing this can help illustrate your opinion for people unfamiliar with the new act you're discussing. For example: ""My Chemical Romance channels Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' all through its epic 'The Black Parade.' Listeners to both will hear similarities throughout - while Queen's style is a bit smoother and more eclectic, MCR's heavier, more abrasive drums make for good over-the-top fun.""

, Read other music reviews. Find out if the music you're listening to ""sounds like"" anything else - when several different reviewers draw a comparison like the above, it might be helpful to listen to that record too. Playing an instrument may qualify you to discuss tone, or embouchure or harmonic techniques, but the only qualification you need to critique is familiarity with the music - and being familiar with other, similar stuff is half that battle.

, Perhaps you saw something obscure once that comes to mind when you hear this music. See if you can contact the band to ask about it. For example: The aforementioned album, ""The Black Parade"" contains a song called ""Sleep."" In it, a part of the lyric mentions ""...all the good guys and the bad guys, all the monsters that I've been..."" One critique remembered a line from a song in a movie from many years earlier, ""All the good guys and the bad guys that I've been... all the devils that disturbed me, and the angels that defeated them somehow come together in me now."" Later, Gerard Way confirmed that he had taken great inspiration from Phantom of the Paradise - the movie in which the song appeared.

, This is the most fun of all. It's fun to talk music with your friends. The best way to do it is to never say ""That sucks"" or to allow others to say it. Instead, head off fights by saying, ""Whoa, whoa - wait. It doesn't suck. You may not like it. I may not like it. But somebody likes it, and it's disrespectful to anyone here who might like it to say that. Instead, let's just say ""That's not my cup of tea"" or ""Not my taste"" when we don't like something."" Or perhaps just agree. Either is completely valid.

, That's how word about good music spreads! If you've done your homework, when your friend comes in and tells you he wants to listen to something like Yellowcard, but he's bored with all of his Yellowcard albums, ask him to try Breaking Benjamin. If you like Daughtry, but you've listened to that album 500 times already, try Three Doors Down, or Fuel, or Matchbox 20. Pass the good music vibes around!

Find a good location.,
Consider a suite of rooms, if possible.,
Map out the basic set-up.,
Design a signal pathway.,
Get a computer with plenty of RAM.,
Choose recording software.,
Select an appropriate interface for your studio.,
Get some high-quality microphones.,
Be frugal when buying gear.,
Have some musical instruments on hand.,
Soundproof the live room.,
Prepare a vocal booth.,
Set up the instrumentalists in the live room.",How to Make a Recording Studio," The best recording studios are in windowless, well-insulated rooms. Depending on the size of the group you want to record, the room should at least be able to hold a small table for your computer and interface. There should also be room for the performers.


Avoid rooms with lots of outside noise. Aim for the quietest space possible. You don’t want a great take interrupted by your neighbor’s lawnmower.In general, bigger is better. Try to find a room that won’t be too cramped and that has space for several musicians and all your gear.
Pay attention to the room’s floor. Ideal rooms will have hardwood, concrete, or tile flooring, which is better for acoustics. Carpeting will absorb high frequency sounds, but not low ones.It may also get worn down by high foot traffic.
Pick a room with good overall acoustics. This usually means a larger room with fairly high ceilings, asymmetrical walls, and irregular surfaces for sound dispersion.;
, Full-scale recording studios usually have at least two rooms for production. One of these is called the “live room” and another is the control room. There may also be one or more small rooms called booths or “isolation booths.”


In professional studios, the ""live room"" is where musicians perform. It is usually separate from the ""booth,"" where single musicians or vocalists can be acoustically isolated for very clean takes. The engineer does the recording, editing, and mixing of the takes in the control room.
In many homes a suite set-ups won't be possible. You may only have space for a live room. At most, you may be limited to a small live room and control room. Closets can be often be converted into small isolation booths, as well.

, There's more to a recording studio than just microphones and musicians. In most studios there are two major systems. You’ll need to understand and organize these according to your interests and the projects you intend to record.


The first setup is the recording system. This takes in audio from instruments and microphones and records it either digitally (using a computer or digital recorder) or to tape.
The second system is called the monitor system. This includes an amplifier and speakers for the recording engineer to listen to the recording as it is being performed, as well as after the recording to do mixing and editing.You can set up a home recording studio with a pretty small budget. At the very least, you’ll need a computer, a DAW/Audio interface combo, studio monitors, one set of headphones, one mic, a few cables, and one mic stand.It is possible to put together a basic setup for around $400. You probably don’t want to go much lower, though, or the music quality will suffer.

, In the professional world, audio systems of any kind can be illustrated by drawing a signal path. This follows the audio signal from beginning to end to show the user exactly what is being done to the sound in a particular system. For a typical beginner’s studio, the signal path follows a basic plan.The signal starts at the “input source,” i.e. the instruments and microphones. From there is goes to a recording interface – a device that plugs into a computer and converts the analog sound waves into digital data.
From the computer interface, the signal will go into Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software. It is here that the recorded sound can be edited or mixed.
The signal next goes into an audio or recording interface to be returned into an analog signal. The analog signal lastly comes out through the monitor system.

, The more powerful your computer, the easier the producing of music will be. By power, that means lots of storage space and lots of RAM. Upgrading RAM and storage is the most important thing, because this will give the computer faster and smoother running speeds.For most audio software you’ll want a computer with at least a dual core processor. If you intend to to mix lots of tracks, however, consider a quad or multi-dual core.
It's important to have a separate computer for recording. Don't use your personal computer with all of your pictures, games, and music on it. Pro Tools and other recording software will require a lot of operating space.
Apple MacBook Pro is a popular model for many do-it-yourself musicians. This is because the model has lots of storage space, lasts for years, and is very portable.Apple also offers upgrades for RAM, memory, graphics chip, and other options. The computer costs between $1200 and $2500.

, All modern recording studios use computer software to save audio and allow for careful editing. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) vary greatly from one maker to the next, but one is usually included with the purchase of a recording interface.Mac users benefit from the inclusion of Garage Band on modern Macs, while PC users can use one of many free alternatives like the free version of Pro Tools 12.


Pro Tools M-Powered is another common DAW. It is a basic home recording program with limited features.Pro Tools LE offers limited features, again, but is a step up from M-Powered.Pro Tools HD is professional-grade recording software, and has become something of the standard for commercial studios.Other DAWs include Apple Logic (a Mac-only program), Audacity (an open-source program compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux systems), and Ableton Live., Audio interfaces are also called AD/DA Converters, which stands for “Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog.” These interfaces convert analog sound into a digital signal to be processed by your computer, and also turn the digital audio back into analog sound on the monitors. They are an essential part of any good recording studio.


Some entry-level interfaces include Emu’s 1212M, ESI’s Julia, and M-Audio’s Audiofile 192. These models offer quality sound for a modest price.A good quality recording interface typically costs around $150. Monitors (such as the immensely popular KRK Rokit series) start at roughly $300 for a pair.
Higher-grade interfaces like the Focusrite and Audiofire series, Fireface 400 and 800, and Lynx models will cost more, up to a couple thousand dollars.

, Typically, most recording studios have some combo of dynamic and condenser microphones for performers to use. Dynamic mics are better for louder sounds and are more durable. They are used for guitar amps, drums, and other loud sources. Condensers are more delicate and expensive but also more detailed, bright, and clear than similarly priced dynamics.A good dynamic or condenser microphone costs $80-$200.
Be sure that your recording interface has Phantom power when using a condenser mic. This is usually a button or switch labeled ""+48,"" and powers the electronics inside the microphone. If this feature is not available, most microphone preamplifiers can supply power and will be more affordable than buying a new interface.Dynamic mics do not require power, so they can simply be plugged into an interface and used with no preamplifier. In some cases they sound better with a preamp, however.
Some mics also have USB outputs. While these can be plugged straight into a computer, they tend to be of lower quality. Electric instruments will also plug straight into a DI unit or Direct box, which connects to the computer via USB., Like music itself, music production is an art and not a science. The price tag on your gear does always not lead to better quality. Low-end equipment in today's amateur home studios would have been unthinkable to top studio engineers just a few decades ago.


It's possible to record radio bangers on a home studio setup. Expensive gear is great and can lead to great recordings, but don't let that hold you back from making great music.
Take advantage of free software. Native Instruments, Ohmforce, Camel Audio, SSL, and other respected audio companies offer free virtual instruments and effects.
Consider using old analog gear. Most studios are digital these days, but the really good ones still have analog gear you can work into your rig. If you want to put your studio on the map, consider adding a plate reverb unit or a reel-to-reel tape machine. You can record on one of these and bounce the audio into your DAW when you're done. These kinds of sound can't be replicated digitally., Most studios assume musicians want to play their own gear to get a more accurate recording. This makes the engineer’s job more difficult, because she’s got to spend a lot of time setting up unfamiliar instruments. Some studios, however, will have gear in place that the engineer knows and can use to achieve a particular sound.


Try having a variety of gear around. Amps, effects pedals, and guitars are good.
If you have more money, also consider keyboards and synthesizers, drums, or even a piano.

, Soundproofing really does two things. It makes the room quieter by blocking out outside noise. It also makes the sound quality better on recording by absorbing excess acoustic ambience.Professional soundproofing can be expensive. Acoustic foam or panels work if you have money to spend, but may run you significant costs for a large studio. One inexpensive way to reduce sound is in the selection of the studio space. Try to select a live room without windows and with heavy, thick walls or thick insulation.If you are on a budget, get some blankets and cover up any windows and doors to reduce background noise.
Added mass to the walls, like foam, also helps to increase the room’s sound absorption. This should reduce echoes., Most studios set aside space specifically for vocals. Vocals can be hard to record. They should be recorded standing up, which makes it easier for the singer to sustain a good sound. The mic should also be at a comfortable height.


The vocal booth is an isolation booth, so it should be acoustically isolated. Make sure to soundproof it as best you can.
The mic itself should have a pop filter to protect it from saliva and to filter out sharp sounds, like t's and s's. If you don't have a pop filter, you can buy one for $10 or $20.
If your mic is directional, so that only one side picks up sound, turn it so the side of the mic is facing the vocalist. His mouth should be about 10-15 cm away from the mic when singing. This distance shouldn't be altered too much, as it will cause the recording to sound off., You'll want mics to be just far enough from the sound source (i.e. acoustic instruments or amplifiers) so that they don't hinder the musicians. This typically doesn't involve a pop filter of any kind. If you have a small instrumental mic, use that. Instructions are usually included with the user manual.


Use component mics or a single mic above the drums. Recording drums will vary according to the type of sound you want and what kind of gear the musicians come with. The best drum sound comes from single mics that clip onto individual components. You can then put these on the same channel in the DAW.
If you don't feel like outfitting each component with a separate mic, take one mic and position it a few feet above the center of the kit. No pop filter is needed but make sure to face the mic’s recording side down. Doing so will add more ""room sound"" to the mix.

"
Take into account that that this genre can be overwhelming for first-time listeners.,
Before listening to the music, learn and memorize the various and styles (or sub genres) of progressive rock, as there are multiple of them:



Symphonic – Highly influenced by classical music, with complex song structures.,
Band-wise, start with Genesis.,
Move on to the albums.,
Get into other bands.,
Listen to each album closely.,
Make sure to learn to appreciate concept albums.,
Learn to understand the amount of talent necessary for the music to be made.,
Watch performances by progressive rock groups on YouTube, to further appreciate the talent involved.,
Talk to other progressive rock fans online.,
Remember that there are loads of progressive rock bands of all different kinds.",How to Enjoy Progressive Rock," Don't let this turn you away though! It is important to note that many popular classic rock artists, such as The Beatles, Queen and Led Zeppelin, also dabbled in this genre several times. Did you know that Led Zeppelin’s classic track “Stairway To Heaven” is actually a progressive rock song? If you enjoy that song and other lengthy classic rock pieces (such as The Who's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and Dire Strait's ""Tunnel Of Love""), there’s a very good chance that you’ll enjoy progressive rock music as well. Also, Pink Floyd, one of the famous bands in music history, are a progressive rock band, though many are not aware of this at first. A basic love of rock music, especially from the 1960s and 1970s, is necessary for one to be able to at first appreciate and go onto enjoy progressive rock. The genre is challenging and requires an open mind.;
,

Progressive Folk – Features elements of folk, blues, country and world music.

Crossover – More accessible, often radio-friendly progressive rock inspired by classic rock and pop.

Psychedelic – Features surreal, psychedelic guitars and keyboards and sci-fi elements.

Eclectic – Bands in this genre play a broad range of progressive styles.

Progressive Metal – A mixture of progressive rock with heavy metal music.

Jazz Fusion – A mixture of progressive rock with jazz music.

Neo-Progressive Rock – More modern and often highly-advanced progressive rock, largely aimed at veteran fans.
Remember that the styles do not end there. There’s many more – too many to list, and there are still various styles of progressive rock being developed as they constantly cross over with each other to create newer sounds. It can difficult to categorize some progressive rock bands, so sometimes it’s best to just jump in and see what’s there instead of judging them by their genre.

, They're considered the most influential progressive rock group to progressive rock lovers. Becoming a big stadium band by the 1980s and exploring almost every style of progressive rock there is throughout their career, they are a band that is in the hearts of music lovers both inside and outside of the progressive rock world.


To start listening to this timeless band, get hold of their 3-disc compilation ""The Platinum Collection"" and listen to the three discs in order. The first disc features a lot of their pop music, some of which you may recognize from the radio, but it also contains some progressive rock material, mainly the two-part song ""Home By The Sea"" which is a highly accessible prog song to get into compared to others.
The second disc contains a good mixture of progressive rock and pop music, and this particular disc is great for acquiring a taste in the genre as it’s very accessible and light here, mainly due to the warm vocals of Phil Collins.
The third disc is the most challenging – it features just nine tracks from the Peter Gabriel era, with five of them clocking in at eight minutes and over. Start off by listening to the first two discs a few times, and then check out the third disc. It can be overwhelming due to the amount of talent on display and the lengths of the songs, especially on the third one, but don't give up. These songs are very special to many progressive rock fans, and soon you’ll learn to love them.
Take note of the fast and complex keyboard solos from virtuoso Tony Banks, Steve Hackett’s usage of melodic guitar to create atmosphere, the intricate drumming from Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford’s clever bass playing and Peter Gabriel’s dark, powerful vocals.

, Once you’ve absorbed and enjoyed the music of the three discs, it’s time to listen to their albums.


“Duke” is an excellent place to start album-wise because it features the best mixture of their progressive rock and pop music. ""...And Then There Were Three..."" is also an accessible and highly recommended progressive rock album.
Make sure to check out the essential “A Trick Of The Tail” and “Wind And Wuthering” as these two albums arguably contain their most beloved Collins-era pieces and are both considered almost flawless.
If these two albums aren’t your cup of tea at the moment, try some of their later albums, like “Invisible Touch” and “We Can’t Dance”, which are very radio-friendly and easy to listen to, but also show off some of their progressive rock capabilities as well, though they are less obvious.
Once you’ve absorbed the Collins-era music, move onto the Gabriel-era albums as well. The five albums in this era (“Trespass”, “Nursery Crime”, “Foxtrot”, “Selling England By The Pound” and “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway”) are all recommended here, and require multiple listens as there is a lot of complexity on offer.
The Genesis discography is full of extra stuff worth checking out as well, including live albums, B-sides and EP tracks and two multi-disc archive collections.

, After getting into Genesis, whose albums hopefully should have given you an interest and hunger for more progressive rock music, try out some of other progressive rock groups from the era. This genre is very diverse and there are many different styles and bands to absorb. All of these bands, all hailing from the United Kingdom, are considered the greatest in the genre, and the ones that will help you advance further into the genre thanks to their albums: 



Yes – Similar to Genesis, this band is famous for their highly complex guitar and keyboard solos. Their songs are often science fiction-themed and are generally funky, eclectic, nonsensical and a lot of fun. Recommended albums are “Fragile”, “Close To The Edge” and “Going For The One”. 

Pink Floyd – The most commercially successful and well-known progressive rock band, Pink Floyd’s music is highly psychedelic and experimental, with multiple elements of world music and science fiction shining through. Recommended albums are “Atom Heart Mother”, “The Dark Side Of The Moon” and “Wish You Were Here”. 

Camel – A symphonic/eclectic prog group who are known for their luxurious and soothing guitars, melodic keyboards and proficiency for artful instrumental songs. Recommended albums are “The Snow Goose”, “Moon madness” and “Breathless”. 

Gentle Giant – This band’s music is easy to get into and yet still very rewarding. Their songs craft an interesting medieval atmosphere, using brass, strings, percussion and woodwind instruments to great effect, and the slightly shorter lengths of their songs make them palatable for new prog fans. Recommended albums are “Three Friends”, “Octopus” and “Free Hand”. 

Jethro Tull – A progressive folk group, whose songs feature a lot of folk and acoustic elements, woodwind incorporated by famous prog bandleader Ian Anderson, and guitar that ranges from bluesy to heavy. Recommended albums are “Aqualung”, “The Minstrel In The Gallery” and “Songs From The Wood”. 

The Moody Blues – A crossover group who recorded mostly short and straightforward progressive rock songs that feature classical instrumentation and lyrics that range from poetic to amusing to touching. Another great band for prog newbies, especially those who love the Collins era of Genesis. Recommended albums are “Days Of Future Passed”, “On The Threshold Of A Dream” and “A Question Of Balance”.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer – A more difficult progressive rock band to get into, ELP’s music is largely based around the pianos and organs of keyboardist Keith Emerson, and their songs are often creatively chaotic and humorously over-the-top. Recommended albums are “Emerson, Lake & Palmer”, ""Brain Salad Surgery"", “Tarkus” and “Trilogy”. 

King Crimson – Like ELP, this band may be more difficult to get into, but are considered one of the most important progressive rock bands of all. Their style is mainly eclectic and sometimes jazzy with heavy guitars and a lot of other instruments being thrown into the mix. Like with ELP, their music often gets very chaotic (and sometimes quite scary), so proceed with caution. Recommended albums include “In The Court Of The Crimson King”, “Lizard” and “Larks’ Tongues In Aspic”.

Renaissance – With the angelic vocals of Annie Haslam, this is a symphonic prog band who mix a classical style with folk and world music. Recommended albums are ""Prologue"", ""Ashes Are Burning"" and ""Scheherazade And Other Stories"".

Rush-A more rock-esque band, this Canadian trio has a focus on keyboards and other progressive rock features in a more rock-oriented way(though still progressive). They have some long compositions(Cygnus X-1) and even a concept album(2112). You should listen to "" 2112"", ""Hemispheres"" and ""Moving Pictures"" as their main ones.

, Take note of the sections of each of the songs you choose to listen to.


Close your eyes and try to imagine the scenarios that the songs are crafting, the themes being explored and the meanings of the lyrics. Play these songs again and again to really take in what is going on, comparing each song as you do so. And if you can’t get into a certain track, try another.
Remember to start with shorter tracks – if you can’t get into the longer songs, some over 20 minutes, don’t worry. These songs will arouse your interest eventually, as once you appreciate the shorter songs, the longer ones will appear more tempting. The longest progressive rock tracks are often the greatest, including songs such as Genesis’s “Supper’s Ready”, Yes’s “Close To The Edge” and Pink Floyd’s “Atom Heart Mother” all of which contain multiple parts with loads of surprises all the way through.

, These kinds of albums are a significant part of progressive rock, as they are albums that tell stories and must be listened to from start to finish in order to be fully appreciated and enjoyed. Albums such as Genesis’s “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway”, Camel’s “The Snow Goose” and The Moody Blues’ “Days Of Future Passed” are excellent examples of classic concept albums of the progressive rock genre, all taking the listener on magical adventures with every track being necessary to the experience.

, Progressive rock is a genre which requires mastery of one’s instrument and a large amount of knowledge on song-writing regardless of the style. Progressive rock albums take a long time to write, rehearse and record, and though not all go on to become classics, the most famous progressive rock albums, like Genesis’s “Selling England By The Pound”, Yes’s “Close To The Edge” and Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side Of The Moon” are considered landmarks in recorded music. If you play an instrument, you may want to try playing the genre yourself; it’ll take a while to adapt to a complex style if you are more accustomed to playing simpler songs on your instrument, but it’s well worth knowing how to play progressively.

, There are loads of videos of various bands of this genre performing live and most of them will show you how they are able to make their music and project it to their audience. Make sure to note how the band carefully works together to perform their songs, including the broad range of playing techniques, the instruments used and the sense of unity. This can also help you get into styles of prog that you’re struggling with, as it can be interesting to see the passion of the group and the personality they give off.

, They're easy to find if you use Google to search for progressive rock websites and forums, or Facebook for prog rock pages and groups. You can also join forums for individual prog bands, as these will almost always feature ""other band"" sections where you can discuss a wide variety of bands in the progressive rock genre and other genres as well. Here you discuss your progress with progressive rock, review your favorite and least favorite albums, and obtain the thoughts, opinions and band/album recommendations of people who may be experienced with the genre. You will find progressive rock fans to be among the kindest, cleverest and most open-minded people online, and they will more than happy assist you in your journey through prog.


Read up on the histories and discographies of each artist, reviews submitted by users for each album, the lists of the most beloved progressive rock albums of every sub genre and from every country, and any other things you might want to know. With enough effort and interest and discussion with other followers of the genre, soon you will be able to appreciate and explore the genre further.

, Don’t feel like you have to bankrupt yourself by buying every album you can find. Recommended bands to explore outside of the golden years of progressive rock (the late 1960s to the late 1970s) include Porcupine Tree (psychedelic prog/progressive metal), Marillion (neo-progressive rock/art rock), Anathema (symphonic prog) and IQ (neo-progressive rock), among many others. It’s up to you – there’s a massive amount of choice for you in this genre and ProgArchives will help you find the ones you want. Soon enough, you will have built a large collection of excellent progressive rock albums.

Talk to others.",How to Listen to Classical Music Critically," In classical music there are many performance and composition styles and techniques. To develop a critical personality you must first be aware as much as you can about the subject. This is an ongoing process. There is never an end to listening and learning about classical music.;
, Not only are the concerts themselves a part of the educational process, but often orchestras have a class (or question and answer session) before or after the concert. Usually a local university professor or the conductor will give a lecture about the pieces of that particular concert.

, There are many time periods in classical music. They also happened at different points in history in each individual country. This is important for building up a framework to understand style. Not only were pieces composed in different ways throughout history, they also were performed in different ways.

, It is best to start to learn about the instruments that you already know how to play, or that you like.

, Think of the compositional techniques the composer used. Was it different than any other composer from that time? ""Le Sacre du Printemps"" is probably the best example to use. It was one of the most revolutionary pieces ever in classical music. Not only was the music of Stravinsky revolutionary for its time, but in combination with the ballet, it was one of the most forward-thinking artistic creations of all time. It is impossible for every piece to be radical for its time, but it is perhaps the first step to identifying a masterpiece.

, There is a blurred line between what a cliché idea and an intellectual idea is. This also has much to do with the time period and nationality of the piece. The pitches (melodic and harmonic) and rhythms must communicate something, that is the bottom line.

, Orchestration is often something that is admired or just forgotten about. Ravel was arguably the best orchestrator of the 20th century, if not all time. The reason that so many people think that is because he could communicate his unique musical ideas very well through some of the most unusual instrumental combinations. In the end, orchestration is something that is an individual opinion, just like most aspects of classical music. When judging orchestration the best question to ask yourself is ""Did the instruments that were used speak the musical ideas clearly?""

, This is another thing that heavily depends on the time period of each individual piece. Did the form communicate the musical ideas in the clearest way? Did the composer use the tradition of the time in a creative way? The first movements of Beethoven's symphonies are usually used as examples of the most creative use of the Sonata form.

, Nobody is perfect, and we are all human. Recordings are going to always sound better technically than a live performance. That taken into consideration, a performer should play correct rhythms, notes, intonation and all with a beautiful sound. If the performer decides not to do these things, it must be very clear that the performer is making an artistic interpretation. However, it must always complement the piece.
Were the performers aware of the style? This is often a problem. 18th century French music is not played in the same way as 20th century American music. Instrumentalists often get so involved with their own musical ideas or playing their instrument well that they forget about their own part in the artistic process. A composition must be played in an authentic way or in a totally different and unique way.
Did the performer communicate the artistic meanings behind the music? This is often a hard step to identify. In today's classical music audiences are fooled into thinking that because a performer moves around all the time while they play, that the performer must be ""musical"" or ""artistic."" This is simply not the case. A performer must play the music in a way that highlights the brilliance of each piece. They must connect the audience to the deep hidden layer of the thought process of each individual composer. This is the difficult job of the performer. (S)he must be a clairvoyant.

, Realize good compositions are played by bad musicians and bad compositions are played by good musicians.

, If you find a performance that you enjoyed, get feedback about your opinions. Often talking about classical music with other educated friends is the best way to start to have an informed opinion about it."

",How to Encourage Your Children to Attend Music Lessons," If you want your children to be musically talented or interested, involve them in music at all times. Have music on in the car, in the kitchen, when eating dinner, all the time. Constantly having music playing is a very good way to integrate music into their lives.


Make music from everyday things. If you are cooking with your kids, use the wooden spoons and upturned bowls to make up a song while you bake. If you're out playing sport together, use the sporting gear to make musical sounds. Find music in the ordinary so that children can see how easy it is to make music a constant part of their lives.





;
, There are many ways to help your children see how enjoyable music is.


Take your children to a gig when they are a little older.
Go to music concerts especially made for kids. Many top and local artists will throw an occasional show at which they do numbers for kids. Some musicians always play for kids. Look online and in local papers for events.






Go to open air and outdoor musical festivals. Children love the freedom of being able to run about freely while music is playing all the time. Take along a rug, a picnic, some toys and make a day of it.






Integrate music and craft. Have children make their instruments first, then prepare a tune on them together afterward.






Teach your children about some of the most inspiring musicians of all time like Bob Dylan; play music from your top favorite artists of the past through to the present, to help give them a broad grounding in many types of music.






Include classical music experiences with fun activities like playing a board game (without lyrics, it won't interfere with thinking) or when you're all resting together as a family.







, If you leave it late, they may struggle to get involved with music or may be less interested in just enjoying listening to it.


Make use of technology such as MP3 players, tablets and the like to play music anywhere, from a picnic to bath time. The portability of music has never been easier––imagine what people from the past would think about our ability to carry entire orchestras around with us whenever we wish!

, Enjoying music is one thing, but being able to play or sing the song is a special feeling. Don’t let your child miss out on that, as being musically attuned is one of the most enjoyable things you can do to refresh your mind, reduce stress and just have fun in general. If your children are invested in the music choice, they are more likely to want to keep up the lessons.

, Music lessons for children are a great way to get your children involved, as they'll be around other students of their own age and will have access to quality teaching. Look for a place that employs teachers with specific training in teaching children, as they'll be receptive to making the experience interesting and enjoyable as well as focused.


Music is a potential career in the future for your child; music lessons are a huge part of the future learning environment for your child.

, More practical and enjoyable, most children enjoy music school over normal education, as the tutors keep the tasks varied and fun.


A summer camp focused on music is another excellent option for children to be completely immersed in all things musical, along with lots of other fun activities.

, Of course, if your child is going to learn, you have to learn too. It is your role to help them revise what they learn in music school, to make sure that they can do some additional learning with you in the house when they come home. It’s vital that your children feel like you are invested in their hobby too. If your child was to play for a sports team, you would be determined for them to enjoy themselves and succeed––music is just the same.

, Constant yelling and nagging to do music practice can soon turn both child and parent off the whole music lessons idea. Instead, aim for a calm environment that encourages music practice.


Ask gently if your child is doing the music practice needed to learn the next piece, prepare for a music exam, etc. without turning it into a do-or-die situation. Tension associated with practice will only make it seem more like a chore and less desirable to children.

, Back up the quality of the lessons with good home space for doing music practice. Some things that can help include:


Setting up a comfortable and quiet area away from others for music practice. Siblings and pets can be unhelpful distractions, so a quiet spot is very helpful.
Keeping all electronics off and out of sight. The less distractions, the better.






Providing appropriate seating or other support. If your children feel comfortable and relaxed, this frees them up to concentrate on the music instead of complain about the hard seating or cold room!

, There are likely ways that you can alleviate the complaints, such as changing teachers, rearranging a schedule so that things aren't so rushed or finding more interesting music to play, etc. Even if it means switching from violin to electric guitar, remember that it's still music.

Listen beyond the tearing guitars and unusual vocals.,
Watch a live death metal performance.,
Remember that in death metal, unlike many other genres, each band almost always writes their own music.,
Don't take the context and subject matter personally.,
Learn about the subgenres.,
Respect the artists.",How to Appreciate Death Metal," Although the rough guitar sound and guttural vocals that permeate much of death metal can take a little getting used to (especially if your ears are accustomed to softer sounds), it's more than just idiotic noise. There are melodies, patterns, and complexities to be realized and appreciated if enough time is spent soaking it all in.;
, Observe how the group members manipulate the instruments. It can be quite an experience especially since the shows are often small and you can walk near or behind the stage to observe the musicians up close. If you've ever tried to play those instruments yourself, you'll probably be amazed with how skillfully they play. It takes practice and dedication, which challenges the stereotype of metal heads being lazy and careless. You might also be surprised about how energetic some of the performers are.

, That includes the riffs, drums, solos, and lyrics. Writing your own music demonstrates another dimension of instrumental mastery and talent, as well as making the music more personal and less manufactured.

, Death metal lyrics and themes aren't intended to be taken literally. They document the outer extremes of human experience which other genres don't dare touch, such as the motivations of serial killers, the activities of the walking dead, death itself, and isolation. Also, many bands will cover other topics not usually associated with death, such as Norse mythology. Many bands explore political and religious issues, and write about historical events.


Keep in mind that some death metal lyrics, especially the gore and brutal varieties, often, but not always, elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, rape and necrophilia. To many people, these subjects are extremely disturbing, upsetting and off-putting, even to many metalheads. Use your best judgment, including independent online band and album reviews, as well as skimming lyrical content before buying, if you are particularly concerned about the issue.
Be careful not to completely rule out a listening test based solely on lyrical content. Many online music stores have thirty-second clips that can demonstrate the groove of a song, and if the musical content sparks your interest, perhaps the lyrics can be taken more lightly.
Look up the lyrics. A common misconception of heavy metal is that all heavy metal bands lyrics are very vulgar, using a lot of bad language. You might be surprised by the complexity and large vocabulary found in the lyrics in some death metal bands.

, Not all death metal is the same. The genre contains many subgenres that can frequently mix and intermingle with each other. As a result, it may be difficult to ascribe a band under a single subgenre. Here's a general guideline to get you started:


Blackened - adopts thematic and musical elements of black metal: Akercocke, Behemoth, Belphegor, Dissection, God Dethroned, Firdous Angelcorpse, Sacramentum, Zyklon, Crimson Thorn, Mayhem and many others
Brutal: Aborted, Cryptopsy, Cannibal Corpse, Blood Red Throne, Deeds of Flesh, Degrade, Deranged, Disavowed, Disgorge, Guttural Secrete, Hate Eternal, Immolation, Internal Suffering, Origin, Skinless, Spawn of Possession, Suffocation, The Genocide Architect, Wormed and many others
Death/Doom - slow tempos, melancholic atmosphere, deep growling vocals double-kick drumming: Anathema (earlier works), Asphyx, Autopsy, Paradise Lost, Disembowelment, Cathedral (early works), Swallow the Sun, My Dying Bride and Winter.
Goregrind/Deathgrind - intense, brief, rare guitar solos, more prominent shrieked vocals: Regurgitate, Carcass (earlier work), Terminally Your Aborted Ghost, Dead Infection, Anal Bleeding, Decomposing Serenity, XXX Maniak
Industrial - Borrowing elements from industrial elements such as writing patterns, synths and technical rhythms: Noein, The Berzerker, Synthetic Breed, Grenoeur, Oblivion Machine
Melodic - Iron Maiden-esque guitar harmonies and melodies with typically higher-pitched growls: Children Of Bodom (earlier work), Amon Amarth, Arch Enemy, The Black Dahlia Murder, At Odds with God, At the Gates, Carcass (later work), Dark Tranquillity, Desultory, Dethklok, Disarmonia Mundi, Ensiferum, Hilastherion, Hypocrisy, Immortal Souls, Kalmah, Norther, Souls, In Flames (earlier work), Sacrilege, Wintersun, Scar Symmetry, Insomnium, Noumena, Rapture, and Daylight Dies.
Symphonic - Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Nightsleep and Septic Flesh
Technical/Progressive - dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, sometimes includes clean vocals and acoustic guitars, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies: Amoral (earlier work), Arsis, Beneath The Massacre, Brain Drill, Cryptopsy, Cynic, Death, Decapitated, Gorguts, Immolation, Job for a Cowboy, Necrophagist, Nile, Ominous, Opeth, Origin, Pestilence, Psycroptic, Sleep terror, Spawn of Possession, The Faceless, Visceral Bleeding, Meshuggah, PsyOpus.

, The greatest death metal musicians almost can't make a living with what they do, and yet the musicians in these bands continue on in spite of their obscurity. Death metal is so non-mainstream that its musicians have to work incredibly hard for their career sales to reach even a million copies (which very few death metal musicians have actually done). Many death metal musicians are highly intelligent people with comprehensive musical training.

Audition.",How to Join a Drum and Bugle Corps," Drum corps are relatively exclusive when it comes to instrumentation- no woodwinds of any sort are allowed to march, including all variety of saxophone. In the brass family, the DCI and DCA (more on them later) both have rules only allowing bell-front valved brass instruments into drum corps. That means trombonists, French horn players, and Sousaphone players will want to learn trumpet, mellophone, baritone/euphonium, or contrabass/tuba. Percussion instruments offered generally shift from corps to corps, depending on their style or show each year.;
, Drum corps is a world with a different vocabulary than that of the rest of the world. Some of the more commonly used terms are listed here.


DCI is short for Drum Corps International, which is in charge of junior drum corps. Junior drum corps are drum corps that allow members between the ages of 13 to 21, though they may be more exclusive if they chose.
DCA stands for Drum Corps Associates, and is in charge of all-age drum and bugle corps. While not as popular as DCI drum corps, all-age corps are starting to be more popular.
""Phantom"" style is a reference to The Phantom Regiment's marching style, which is unique. You may hear any other corps name inserted, though, as nearly all corps have their own unique style. Spirit, for example, has a ""rolling walk"" style, while Cavaliers have a ""high walk"" of sort, and Phantom has a ""sharp"" style.
World class/open class/international class are the different classes of drum corps as of 2008. World class corps have exactly 150 members, while open class corps has 30-150 members. International class is the class for corps based in countries outside of North America that wish to tour the DCI circuit.
""Contra"" normally refers to the contra-bass, which is the tuba of drum and bugle corps. They look rather like very large baritones, slung over one shoulder, as seen in this picture.

, Since practice schedules are often extremely difficult to follow, but time commitment is a huge part of making a corps, when looking into joining a corps, look at the local ones first. You may be surprised what isn't that far away- in 2008, there were 24 different drum corps in the World Class of DCI alone, almost all from different states.

, Currently, in DCI, at least, there are no corps that are female-only, however, the Cavaliers and the Madison Scouts are male-only corps. In other countries, female-only corps are, while not common, existent, at least.

, In today's global economy, fees may be the deciding factor between you marching in a corps, and you just watching the show from the stands. If you have financial problems, but are talented, some corps offers scholarships to help with dues. After you've marched a year or two of corps, though, it's much easier to get money for marching.

, Regardless of what corps you decide on, when the audition weekend is, how your marching, playing, or attitude is, if you're even considering getting into corps, you must be in shape. You're not looking to build that much muscle mass, though, so standard workouts may not be exactly what you need. You should be looking to be lightweight, true, but quick and nimble. Running, biking, and swimming all help out with this without weighing you down with extra muscle mass. Push-ups and crunches are also recommended, as they will help you build the endurance you will need to survive drum and bugle corps.

, Drum corps schedules are demanding, to say the least, and there is very little room for error when first going out for a corps. People understand, though, that everyone has lives outside of drum corps. As long as you are upfront and clear about any conflicts in your schedule, and they don't conflict too often, of course, you can normally have a bit of ""wiggle room"", though that really depends on the corps most of all.

, Also, look into what else the audition exactly entails. A standard audition for drum corps includes prepared pieces of some sort, a piece of your own, sight reading, basic marching skills, and a section in which you have to march and play at the same time. It's obviously best to practice as many of these things as possible, especially if you are particularly weak in any of these areas. Range, lip setting, dynamic ability, posture, and tone are all major factors for brass players. Keep in mind, meanwhile, that many drum corps also judge attitude! Be positive, polite, and don't make excuses for yourself.

, Each corp, as previously mentioned, has their own style. You don't have to know this prior to auditioning, as the instructors will teach it later, but it can't hurt to be one step ahead.

, Make sure that, a week or two prior, you registered for the audition, if that was required, and paid any audition fees. Instrumentalists should bring their instrument to the first camp (normally corps-owned instruments aren't distributed until at least the second weekend), a folding music stand, their music, and any oils, tuners, metronomes, etc. that may be needed for the weekend.

, At this point, there's nothing that should be said. If you have practiced enough, have the talent and ability, and just a bit of luck, you should do just fine. If not, there's always next year!

Start with the right shoulder position.,
Do a front and back present position.,
Move to the right or left present position.,
Perform a right or left slam.",How to Do Color Guard1," Get familiar with the right shoulder position, one of the most common fundamental flag positions you will begin any other movement from. Start in a comfortable stance with feet shoulder width apart.Hold a right shoulder position by placing your left hand around the tip or stopper of the flag’s pole and hold it at the height of your bellybutton. Place your right hand around the pole at the tape or “tab” where the pole and the silk of the flag meet.
Perform a left shoulder position by switching the placement of your hands, with the right hand at the stopper and your left hand at the tab.;
, Build on right shoulder position by moving to front present or back present. Keep your hands in the same placement while you straighten your right or left arm for these positions.


Get in front present position by beginning in right shoulder position. Push your right arm straight out in front of you. The left arm may be bent to bring the stopper slightly further in toward your belly button, while the right arm extends so that the pole tilts away from you at eye level.
Begin in right shoulder position for back present. Push your left hand up and out straight in front of you so that it is parallel to the ground. This will cause your right hand to extend above your head, with the flag above and tilted to the back of you.

, Start in right shoulder position to transition to right present or left present. These positions create a diagonal angle with the pole to the right or left of your body.


Start in right shoulder position and move your right arm out to the right for right present, keeping your left hand over the stopper at your belly button.
Begin in the right shoulder position for left present as well, though this time your right hand will cross over your face and body to the left, with your left hand still at your belly button. Lower your shoulders so you can still see over your arm in this position.

, Create a slightly more dramatic movement with a slam. Use the same right shoulder position to create a diagonal line in either direction across your body.


Begin in a right shoulder position for a right slam. Pull your right hand down toward your right hip at the same time that you pop your left hand up toward your left shoulder, keeping your hands in the same position on the flag.
For a left slam, start in right shoulder position. Let go of the flag with your left hand and hold that hand face up and cupped at your left hip. Use your right hand to swing the flag down toward your left hip, “catching” your right hand in your cupped left hand. The pole will be tucked up into your right armpit."
"
Perform flag carving.,
Spin the flag.,
Try a basic J toss.",How to Do Color Guard2," Learn to move the flag in front of your body within a 45° plane. The common move goes by a variety of names, including figure eight, hourglass, cone, or witch’s broom.


Start with hands at a right shoulder position on the flag. Move your right hand out into a front present position (point one), then across your body to the left, with the left hand to the right so that the pole creates a diagonal across your body (point two).
Bring your left hand up parallel to the ground into a back present position (point three), then bring the pole down horizontally in front of your eyes (point four). Keep your hands in the same position on the flag to create the reverse of point one, with the stopper in the air and silk toward the ground (point five).
Create the reverse of point two by bringing your right hand across to your left hip and left hand across to the right (point six). Create right slam position, with your right hand down to the right and left hand up to the left (point seven). Finish with the pole horizontal, but with your right hand pushed out so that the pole is at an angle.
Repeat this circuit in one fluid motion to create the shape of a cone or figure eight with your flag., Execute a basic spin with the flag by alternating the hand that turns the flag to complete a full circle. There are a couple of different kinds of spins, but the drop spin is the most common.


Start in right-hand position. Let go of the flag with your left hand and swing the flag down with your right so that the silk is now toward the ground and the stopper is in the air (point one).
Meet the flag with your left hand in a cupped position to grab it, then let go with your right hand. Swing the flag upright again so that the silk is facing up (point two).
Repeat this sequence, alternating which hand controls the flag until you can do it in one fluid motion to create the spin., Try a simple toss of the flag, which you can execute by releasing the flag so that it spins once before catching it. You can also do this toss from a drop spin.


Hold the flag in right-hand position, then release your left hand and hold it outstretched with the palm upright, which is called a “money hand.” Place the pole of the flag in the crook between the thumb and fingers of this hand to begin the toss.
Let the flag drop down with your right hand at the same time that you push it up with your left hand to release it into the air. The flag should make one full rotation before you catch it upright with your left hand."
"
Learn basic rifle positions.,
Do a drop spin.,
Try a single toss.",How to Do Color Guard3," Place your hands correctly on a color guard rifle in preparation for any other movements you will do with it. Right and left flat are the two main positions you will use.


For a right flat, place your right hand underneath the neck of the rifle, which is the skinny part between the butt and barrel. Your palm should be facing up and holding the strap to the rifle, and your thumb should be pressed against the back side of the rifle, not wrapped around.
Place your left hand over the top of the tip of the barrel, with the palm facing down. Both of your hands should be holding the barrel parallel to the ground.
For a left flat, reverse the direction of the rifle. Place your right hand over the top of the butt, and your left hand under the middle of the barrel (halfway between the bolt and the screw)., Perform a drop spin with a color guard rifle on either the right or left side. This maneuver is very similar to a drop spin with a flag, but the weight and the shape of a rifle is quite different, of course.


Start in right flat by placing your right hand on the neck of the rifle (skinny part between butt and barrel), face up, and your left hand on the tip, face down.
First push the tip of the rifle down with your left hand to swing downwards. Then release with your right hand to let it swing in the air and make a full rotation before catching it again.
To do a spin on the other side, place your left hand on the middle of the barrel, face up, and your right hand on the butt, face down., Toss the rifle with a similar movement as you use for a drop spin. This is virtually the same movement as a J spin with a flag.


Start in right flat with your right hand under the neck and your left hand over the tip. Push the tip down with your left hand, so it drops toward the ground.
Then release with your right hand to allow the rifle to spin once and catch it when it is flat in the opposite direction than you started from.
The difference between this and a J toss with a flag is the timing. Instead of pushing with one hand and releasing with the other at the same time, as you would with a flag, you release just after you push with a rifle."

Ask questions of the director, like what is involved in the audition process, or what the team’s practice schedule is like.
It’s also a good idea to watch color guard practices and performances to see what it’s like, or talk to other people already on the team about their experiences.
Someone leading a color guard may also be called a caption head, or be involved with “auxiliary,” which can refer to all visual elements of a marching band, including color guard as well as dance teams, baton twirlers, etc., Look out for posters or announcements regarding auditions for the color guard. Pay attention to the time, date, and what’s required.


Auditions may require you to show off different skills, depending on whether they have a flag line, rifle line, saber line, etc. Ask what you’ll be expected to display, or if you can audition for a certain type of equipment.
Make sure you know if you’re required to bring any of your own equipment or other items so you can come prepared.
Auditions may very often involve an instructor teaching you a new skill that you may not know. Be prepared to listen closely and ask questions so you can pick up the skill. The instructor and any other judges won’t be looking for perfection, just that you are able to take instruction well.

, Keep up with the new skills you learn from the team or on your own so that you can improve from season to season. You can practice on your own, or get a group together, even when the season isn’t in session.


If you don’t make the cut in an audition, continue to practice basic skills on your own. Seek out instruction videos on the internet, or ask a friend or instructor to give you some tips in their spare time.
Keep practicing your skills throughout the winter to stay sharp for when color guard practice starts up for the next season unless your school has a winter guard to join to keep practicing and performing.

, Ask the instructor that leads color guard about winter guard. Check for any information your school distributes about joining this off-season team.


Join winter guard as a way to continue to improve your skills throughout the season, as well as get the chance to perform in competitions dedicated to the sport.
Winter guard may be done with pre-recorded music, or with a live indoor percussion group, instead of a full marching band at outdoor events."

Paint and decorate your mask to your liking.",How to Make a Deadmau5 Head1," In this method, we'll use a beach ball as a sort of ""mold"" for our papier mâché Mau5head. If following the dimensions above, you'll want a ball that's 14"" in diameter when inflated. Inflate your ball so that it's nice and firm and make sure it's securely plugged - you don't want your ball to lose any air during the lengthy drying process.


Note that a beach ball isn't absolutely necessary - any spherical object will work as long as it's rigid and about the right size.;
, Next, we'll create a rigid ""shell"" from papier mâché that will form the central spherical portion of our Mau5head. There are several different ways to make papier mâché. Any method that works for you is fine, though we are partial to wikiHow's own papier mâché recipe. Once you've made your liquid mixture, soak thin strips of torn newspaper in it, then lay them flat on the beach ball. Continue until your ball is completely coated (leaving a clear area around the air nozzle) and you cannot see its design through the paper. Let dry overnight.


You will want a strong, rigid Mau5head, so it's generally a good idea to plan on laying down several layers of papier mâché. Some online methods recommend as many as nine layers.

, The initial papier mâché layers may not be as thick or rigid as you desire. If not, add more as you see fit. Each time you add additional layers, you'll want to let your Mau5head sit for another night. Finally, when your Mau5head is just how you want it, undo the beach ball's plug and allow it to deflate. Once it is deflated enough to fit through the hole, pull it out.


Be careful when you pull the beach ball out, as it's likely that it's stuck to the inside of the mask. Be gentle to avoid tearing.

, Next, you'll want to enlarge the hole that you left for the beach ball's plug so that you can get your head into the mask. As you work, make small, conservative cuts and test the size of the opening frequently - it's always possible to cut more, but not to undo cuts you've already made.


Obviously, everyone's head is a different size. While a circular hole of about 7-8"" (17.78-20.32 cm) in diameter will fit most people, you may find that your hole needs to be bigger or smaller.

, What good is a Mau5head without an enormous, creepy grin? Use a pen or pencil to draw an outline for your Deadmau5 - you'll want your mouth to be about 50 degrees wide with the top edge roughly horizontal and the corners of the mouth reaching to the sides of the mask. In other words, the corners of the mouth should align on a 180 degree angle. Use a knife to start a cut in the middle of the area of where your mouth will be. Then, use scissors to carefully cut along your lines until your mouth is completely cut out.

, Deadmau5 has big, circular ears - about 13"" (33.02 cm) in diameter. To replicate these, cut two equally-sized circles from a cardboard box, leaving a small ""tab"" of material on each ear to fit into slots you'll cut to hold the ears in place. Your ears don't have to be exactly the same size as the ones on the real Mau5head - anything from 12-15"" (30.48-38.1 cm) should be fine.

, Next, use a knife to cut small, thin slits in the top of your mask's head. These slits should be just wide enough to accommodate the ""tabs"" on your cardboard ears. Your slits should be angled toward the back of the head at an angle of about 15 degrees and the tops of the slits should be about 3.5"" (8.89 cm) apart. Insert the ears' tabs into these slits and secure with plenty of tape and/or glue.

, Add thin layers of papier mâché to cover the ears, taking special care to add plenty around the ears' tabs to secure them in place. You may even want to add papier mâché around the tab inside the mask as well. Allow to dry overnight.

, Small styrofoam balls, which can be found at most craft stores, are a perfect low-cost solution for making Deadmau5's eyes. You'll want a styrofoam ball about 4.5"" (11.43 cm) in diameter. Cut your sphere in half as precisely as possible. Use a knife, rather than scissors.

, If you're feeling really artsy, you can tape electric lights to the rear ""flat"" portion of each eye for an awesome effect in low-light conditions. You may even want to carve a notch in each eye so that your lights can be embedded within the eyes themselves. When done, your light it should shine through the styrofoam, making the whole eye appear to light up.

, The bulging eyes on the Mau5head should sit about 2"" (5.08 cm) above mouth and 5"" (12.7 cm) apart from each other. If you're not using colored lights for the eyes, you can attach your eyes directly onto the head. If you are using colored lights, you may need to make small holes in the head to accommodate the lights' wires. Tape or glue your eyes in place.


If using colored lights, feed any wire(s) through two small holes beneath the eyes. If your lights are switch-activated, make sure you have easy access to the switch. For instance, when you wear the Mau5head, you may want to snake the wire down the back of your shirt and into your pocket so you can activate the switch inconspicuously.

, Stretch a thin fabric mesh (think panty hose material) across the inside of the mouth to form the Mau5head's ""teeth"". Either hot glue or tape it from the inside to secure it in place. If the mesh you use isn't already white, paint it a whitish color.


You want as thin and tight of mesh as possible, as you'll look through the mesh to see where you're going when you wear the mask!

, Once every part of your mask is in place, put on your mask to make sure it's comfy. Now is your chance to make any last-minute adjustments to make your mask look or feel better.


You may want to ask someone if s/he can see your face. If you get a ""not really"", ""kinda"", or ""no"", then you're probably fine. If not, you may want to paint your mesh more thickly or get another layer of see-through fabric to place behind it. Use caution, however - it's more important that you're able to see than it is that your face is hidden

, Congratulations, you Mau5head is done! All that's left now is to decorate the outside exactly how you want to. You may want to look up some of the different masks Deadmau5 has actually used over the years for inspiration. When all else fails, a single, bright color (like candy apple red) always looks great.

Use fabric, rather than paint.,
Use a lamp globe, rather than a papier mâché sphere.,
Mount a bike helmet or hard hat inside the mask for added comfort.",How to Make a Deadmau5 Head2," If you're a decent tailor, fabric may be a better choice for the outside of your Mau5head than paint. Fabric is strong, durable, and looks great. Even better, though, is the fact that fabric coverings are interchangeable, allowing you to rock several different Deadmau5 looks without having to re-paint your mask!

, If you're pressed for time, waiting several days for a papier mâché mask to dry can be a non-starter. If you can get your hands on one, you may want to instead use a thin yet sturdy plastic lamp globe as the central ""head"" portion of your mask. Acrylic plastic lamp globes work well. Obviously, you'll want one roughly the same size as the mask above (14"" (35.56 cm) in diameter)). Lamp globes are often available from specialty home furnishers and at some department stores.


Bonus points if it already includes a hole at the bottom that's big enough for your head!

, Finally, you may find that your Mau5head is more comfortable if you secure a sturdy piece of headgear to the inside of the mask so that you can comfortably ""wear"" the mask on your head. You can do this with superglue (or, if you're worried about damage to your headgear, lots of tape).


Heavy pieces of headgear, like hard hats, can put stress on the mask when you're not wearing it. Make sure your mask is strong and rigid enough to support the weight of any headgear you install inside it to keep your mask from imploding!

Respect the first year band members and the roadies.,
Know where you need to be and get there every single time.,
memorize your music as quickly as possible.,
Dress in layers.,
Don't get lazy.",How to Survive the Marching Season," The directors are the end all do all on the field. They are the ones who make all the final decisions and should be the last person you go to, if you are struggling with marching band. You should always start near the bottom of the chain of command and work your way up. Respect any other paid staff as well.;
, It's their responsibility to make sure everyone in their section is marching and playing well. They have been chosen as leaders over other upperclassmen in their section.

, These are the people who have been in band longer than most. They have more experience and wisdom than underclassmen, but no decision making abilities.

, Roadies are usually adults and fellow students who load instruments and props. Treat them well, and help them when possible, and you might find that life is a lot easier.

, Memorize your drill spots and coordinates, because if you don't, you will stick out like a sore thumb! You might find that it helps to run through the show by yourself if you get to rehearsal early.

, When you don't know you're music, you are not a box 5 performer.

, Oh, it's sunny and warm when you leave the house? That can change. Quickly. You should always bring layers to change into in case it rains or suddenly drops 30 degrees.

, If you spend months refining your style and learning your spots, why does the band seem to progressively get worse? That's on individual effort. Keep up the motivation until the very end. There are no excuses not to get better.

Be yourself.",How to Be a Metalhead," Metal is an extremely diverse genre of music that encompasses many distinct styles. Be aware of the most prominent styles and their unique characteristics. It may be that a certain subgenre of metal isn’t your cup of tea, while another really speaks to you. Diehard metal fans should at least be able to articulate the particulars of each major style.Heavy metal is the progenitor of all other strains of metal. It is characterized by its mid-tempo rhythms, melodic, technical instrumentation and operatic vocals.

Power metal makes use of fantasy motifs such as dragons, wizards and warriors. It is notable for its powerful percussion, harmonic techniques and triumphant tone.

Thrash metal is an outgrowth of hardcore punk, and features blasting rhythms and chugging guitar riffs played at extremely high speeds. Owing to its roots in the mid-to-late 80s, thrash metal has an infatuation with themes like nuclear war, Armageddon, mutated monsters and cartoonish violence.

Doom metal takes cues from psychedelic rock and blues. It focuses on guitars heavily distorted with effects like “fuzz,” lo-fi analogue recording techniques and references to crime, nature, the supernatural and the occult.

Black metal is a form of extreme metal dealing with Satanic, medieval and occult subject matter. Black metal musicians are renowned for their theatrical costumes and black and white “corpse paint” that is meant to give them a ghastly appearance.

Death metal is usually played at a very low tuning and features guttural, growling vocals. Among its imagery, death, dismemberment, torture, and gruesome acts are prevalent.

Grindcore is a punishingly loud, distorted and often chaotic subgenre of metal known for its relentless pace and aggression. Grindcore vocals are typically growled or screamed at full volume.;
, Browse the metal section at your neighborhood record store, or use a entertainment streaming service like YouTube or Spotify to begin your journey into metal music. If you’re interested in becoming a metalhead, it’s essential that you develop an appreciation for the music itself. Devour everything you can get your hands on at first and find out what you like and dislike.Because the genre has been progressing and expanding since the late 70s, knowing where to begin can be difficult. For a good entry point, look up lists of best metal groups, albums and songs as ranked by fans and critics.Some programs such as Spotify, Google Play Music and Last FM have music discovery features which can help point you to new artists similar to artists whose music you like.

, After you’ve heard a little of what the genre has to offer, fine tune your listening habits to narrow down your preferences. Take note of artists, albums and individual songs that stand out to you. Create a kind of mental catalogue of the music you’ve heard so you can analyze and discuss it later.Make a list of your favorite bands and which of their works you most enjoy. This can clue you in to what kind of metalhead you’re most likely to be.
Metal has an extensive and storied history. As a result, the average metal aficionado is like a walking encyclopedia of music knowledge., Acquire digital or CD copies of your favorite metal albums, or go above and beyond and seek out the vinyl pressings. As you delve further into the realm of metal music, you’ll amass a collection that you can revisit and share with others. Your storehouse of metal mementos could also include band merchandise, collectible memorabilia, autographs from musicians and even documentary films about the artists and their inspirations.Organize your library of music by creating custom playlist on iTunes, Last.FM, Spotify or Google Play Music.The more you collect, the more knowledgeable you will become about heavy metal music, history and culture.

, Black is the cornerstone of metal fashion. Start incorporating more black clothing into your wardrobe and daily outfit selection. The color black represents darkness, death, evil and other bleak themes embraced by metal culture. Avoid bright colors, normal, “mundane” garments (skirts, polo shirts, sandals, etc.) and any other items commonly worn by the uninitiated.The dark color has come to be strongly associated with the metal lifestyle. Metal musicians and fans often wear black from head to toe.
Avoid wearing light hues, like white, khaki or light gray, or bright colors.

, From the waist down, metalheads can almost always be spotted wearing tight-fitting dark blue or black denim jeans. These are often in various stages of disrepair—they can be tattered and full of holes or held together with fabric patches depicting band symbols or slogans. Try to find a pair with a sharp taper rather than a baggy or flared leg fit.Black shorts (usually with cargo pockets), cutoffs and bondage or military style pants are also common.

, Show your support of your favorite bands by wearing shirts bearing their logos or other metal imagery. Using clothing to advertise musical tastes is a common practice of metal enthusiasts. It can also serve as a great conversation starter. Best of all, metal t-shirts are nearly exclusively black, which means you’ll never have to worry about matching.Many metal bands make a good part of their earnings by selling merchandise. If you want to help out a band you like, make sure you’re buying officially licensed shirts and other products directly from the band.Pair a black band shirt with a pair of dark jeans, or layer it under a battle jacket.

, Don’t stop at basic black clothing. Exhibit your disregard for societal norms by donning spiked or studded jewelry, heavy black boots and death or combat-related paraphernalia. Battle jackets, denim or leather jackets or vests adorned with spikes, patches or buttons are also a popular choice.The purpose of most of the traits of metal style is to appear dangerous, brooding and antisocial. Violent and aggressive themes, such as modern and medieval weaponry, Vikings and warriors are not out of the ordinary.
If you want to go all the way with your look, paint your fingernails with black nail polish, wear dark makeup or even don the black and white “corpse paint” commonly worn by black metal musicians.

, Take liberties with your appearance to demonstrate your unique sensibilities. There are no rules. Metalheads often sport long, wild hair and grow large beards, or cover themselves in tattoos and piercings. These features can be off-putting to most people, but to fans of metal music they symbolize a nonconformist philosophy and the freedom to live the way one chooses.There’s no dress code for metalheads. While many metal fans wear similar kinds of clothing to signify their membership in the culture, you should wear whatever best suits your own personality.

, Find out about metal shows being put on in your area and make sure you’re in attendance. Being part of the crowd at a loud, aggressive live performance is a much more exhilarating experience than sitting and listening to a record. Live shows are also a great place to meet like-minded people and have a chance to feel like part of a larger, unified movement.Look for flyers are music stores, coffee shops, alternative boutiques and school campuses for information on upcoming metal events.
Most bands post tour dates and venues on their social media pages.

, If you can find others that have the same passion for music, consider taking up an instrument and forming your own band. That way you can participate in the creative side of metal music. You’ll have full control over the over the type of sound you produce and become a fixture in your local metal scene, which can lead to more opportunities to perform and network in the future.Try posting audition announcements in places where metal fans tend to hang out in order to find potential bandmates.
Though a lot of people think that playing metal music doesn’t require skill, this couldn’t be further from the truth. The complex structures and virtuoso soloing of classical music has been highly influential on metal, as have the breakneck tempos of punk and rock and roll., Spend time with others that share your musical preferences. Common interests are often one of the foundations of lasting friendships. Once you’ve made a few friends within the scene, you’ll have someone to listen to records, go to shows and take road trips with. Despite its mistakenly gloomy reputation, the global metal community is quite inclusive and treats its members with the respect of an extended brotherhood.Discover new music with your current friends and get them into metal with you.
Make an effort to meet people at shows or record stores who are also into metal music. Telling someone you like the band on their shirt is a great way to strike up a conversation.

, Run a search for internet forums or social media groups you can become a member of. There, you’ll be able to read posts, voice your opinions and discuss music with other fans from all over the world. It can also provide a channel for you to receive news updates related to the metal music industry, band tour schedules, interesting anecdotes and recommendations for new music.Metal Injection, Metal Sucks and Loudwire are examples of a few higher-profile metal websites.
Take a look at groups on Facebook that are open to the public, and keep up with band media on Instagram, Twitter and Bandcamp.

, Metal is not about fashion or following trends but being yourself. While a certain aesthetic can help you express your individuality, the most important thing is that you remain true to yourself and be authentic. Listen to what you like, dress how you want to dress and make no apologies. Pay no mind to critics who badmouth your lifestyle or the music you listen to, and never make it your goal to impress anyone. Metal was born from the urge to stand at odds with society.Metal is all about freedom, self-expression and the courage to live outside of what is typically regarded as ""normal.""
If you always do what you want rather than what's fashionable, you have more credibility as a metalhead than someone who has the look down but is just trying to gain acceptance from others.

Start off with a well-insulated bottom layer.,
Choose pants that will keep you as warm as possible.,
Put on a warm long-sleeved shirt or sweater, or both!,
Wear a scarf, if you think your neck will be too cold.,
Be sure to have a hat.,
Don't forget to have warm feet!,
Wear gloves.,
Pick up some hand warmers, for the worst practices of all.",How to Dress for a Late Season Band Rehearsal," You can choose spandex (Under Armour is good but there are less expensive brands out there), long underwear, or even a thermal (waffle fabric) top and/or leggings if it's really cold. Make sure whatever you put on top has long sleeves. If you don't have any of these things on hand (like if you live in a southern state that rarely has extremely cold weather), at least wear a thick long-sleeved shirt.;
, You can choose to wear jeans, but they're not as warm as sweatpants and they aren't as comfortable for marching. If you have sweatpants with scrunched ankle cuffs, those are great. Make sure your pants are not too long, or you might step on them while marching.

, A turtleneck might be a good choice, if you don't feel too choked by it, since it keeps your neck warmer and helps trap more heat. Top it off with a thick sweatshirt or jacket.

, Scarves are cute and keep your neck and even chin from getting too cold. However, keep in mind that they can become a hazard, especially if it's windy... having your scarf wrapped around your clarinet while marching is not a good situation to be in.

, Beanies are your best bet, since they're warm and fit to your head without obstructing you or anyone else. If you're in a really cold area, get a fuzzy hat with ear flaps. Remember, you can always wear earmuffs in place of or with your beanie hat. Don't assume the hood on your jacket will suffice, because those can blow off and don't keep your ears very warm, and most directors either frown upon or absolutely don't allow them, since they get in the way of your peripheral vision. ""It's cold outside"" is not a valid excuse to march in crooked lines.

, Look for some really warm socks (SmartWool or similar) that will fit under your band shoes. Do not wear fuzzy socks or slipper-socks, as they will not keep you as warm as you think they will. If you aren't required to wear specific shoes to practice, Ugg boots or something of the kind can work. If it's not cold to the point where you are at risk for frostbite, a pair of thick knee socks might be enough. Also, consider getting inserts for your band shoes to keep your feet more comfortable during long rehearsals.

, Really thick knit ones are best. If you play percussion, clarinet, or have an open-holed flute, your directors may not want you to wear gloves, or have specific rules as to what kinds you can wear. Some bands allow fingerless gloves, which can be fairly warm. If you have no other options, you can at least buy a pair of marching gloves to wear (they're better than nothing), or cut the fingers out of the cheap knit ones sold at stores like Walmart. They'll unravel eventually, but they work in the meantime.

, You can find these at your local Target or drugstore. Some stay warm as long as 7 hours. You can stuff them in your gloves or pockets, and you will quickly become the most popular person in your section if you give them away.

",How to Pack for Band Camp,"



Are you expected to drive to camp, or will a bus be provided? If you drive, you'll have more room for luggage than if you take a bus with the rest of your band.

Will you be at a college with just your school, a camp with schools from all over your state? Will you be staying in dorms, hotel rooms, or cabins? Can you pick who you'll room with? Will you and your roommate/your group want to bring extra items, such as junk food for snacking? If you can pick a roommate (or two), go ahead and make sure you have that worked out.
You'll also want to note the location and weather forecast for your stay, when packing clothes. If you're camping in cabins in the mountains, and all you bring are shorts and t-shirts, you may have a problem!
Try to find out what the dorms will be like before arriving. Dorms at band camps can range from a large room with a bunch of bunk beds or have individual rooms for one/multiple people. This can help you determine what to bring because there could be limited storage space. Most times, you will need to bring your own bedding/sleeping bags, towels, etc.;
, The next few steps will outline what items you'll need to remember/consider. Write down everything that applies to you on a list, which will keep you more organized when packing your actual suitcase.

, Choose clothing based on climate, and keep in mind that band camp is hard work. Even if you're a generally ""cold"" person (you take longer to warm up when you're working, are constantly chilly when everyone else is fine, etc.), you'll want to have plenty of t-shirts and shorts. You may want heavier clothes for nighttime, if it'll get cold, however. Also keep in mind that you'll be dressing for comfort, not style, and after a few days of marching your feet off and getting sunburned, you won't have much patience for anything that involves excessive bending or moving to put on, anyway. If your band camp is for concert band, you will still want a variety of clothing for outdoors as some rehearsals/classes may be outdoors.


Pack a change of clothes for every day you'll be there. If it's a long stay, and laundry services will be available, try to have enough clothes to last a week or two without doing laundry, plus a couple extras of everything, should you be caught in a storm or otherwise have your clothing damaged.
Include plenty of socks and underwear. Socks, especially, as you may get so sweaty that you'll want to change your socks once or twice a day to avoid killing your roommates with the stench.
Pack a pair or two of sturdy, comfortable athletic shoes. Marching in open-toed shoes will not be pleasant, or allowed. Even if your band camp is for concert band, you will likely be doing a fair amount of walking to get to different rehearsals/sectionals/etc.
Remember your band uniform/shirt! While you may not need your full uniform, depending on the camp, you'll probably be required to bring a band polo, t-shirt, or something else that will identify your group. You'll be in some deep trouble if you forget to bring this.
Bring a reusable water bottle. You'll definitely want to have one, and all band members bringing their own to refill definitely beats buying 50+ bottles a day to give everybody. When it is hot and humid outside, you will want water! If your camp is in the middle of nowhere, you may want to bring bottled water to fill your water bottle with as the water there may not taste good.
Be sure to pack all your toiletries, medicines, and other ""bathroom"" items. A list of things that the average camper may need is as follows:

Toothbrush, toothpaste, cheap cup (on the off chance that your living space doesn't already have a few to use).

Brushes, combs, hair scrunchies, a straightener, hairspray, or whatever else you feel that you must put in your hair before you can be seen in public. Try to keep the heavy machinery to a minimum. You'll want to be sure to have everything necessary to French braid your hair, should you need to.
(Girls) -- Makeup, but just the bare essentials. There's no point in spending hours on fancy makeup, just to sweat and smear it all off. Just pack the bare minimum of what you'll need to feel comfortable facing the world.
Deodorant... in excess. You definitely don't want to risk running out. Most camps will not allow you to wear perfume/body sprays due to allergies
""Comfort"" materials, i.e. sunscreen (and plenty of it), lotion (with aloe for sunburns), and chapstick.
Shower materials - shampoo and/or conditioner, your own bar of soap (you'd probably rather not share), razor, towel(s) (in case you can't get them at the camp), and whatever else you absolutely can't live without.
Medicines and/or other medical items. This would include painkiller (as you'll probably want your own supply), an asthma inhaler, contact fluid, or materials to manage diabetes. Your parent or guardian will likely have to fill out a form allowing you to have the medicine with you, or granting permission to go to a nurse to receive it. Be sure to know the policies on medicine, or you could actually be kicked out of camp and/or in trouble for having drugs.
Anything else you may need that hasn't already been listed.



, Before gathering this up, be sure that you know exactly what you'll be doing and playing - if you play multiple instruments, which one does your director expect you to show up with? Will you also be doing drum major/leadership camp? Are you in the guard? Does your Jazz Band, Elite Brass group, or other ""special"" band practice during camp? You may end up bringing a lot of stuff...


Remember all necessary instruments. If you play clarinet in marching band, tenor sax in Jazz Band, and might need your bass clarinet in case you have to fill in for the usual player if he misses camp again, you'll have to bring all those instruments. Large instruments will be their own ""suitcase"", but smaller instruments, like the flute, may be able to be crammed into a suitcase or duffel bag with the rest of your band stuff.
Bring your music stand and/or lyre and flipbook, as well as all music you'll need. Be sure to leave space for new music. You may also want a metronome, tuner, and all sound equipment necessary to make them work. In addition, you'll need extras and backups for all the stuff that makes your instrument work. That means more reeds, more cork grease, more valve oil... even a backup instrument, if you play something small and have an old, dinky one laying around that could be used in an emergency.
If you're in the colorguard, remember your uniform and any flags or rifles that you may be in charge of bringing.
For a percussionist, bring any sticks or drums that you'll be in charge of, as well as grip tape and plenty of extra sticks.
If you're a drum major, bring a whistle, practice mace, or anything else you'll need that others won't. You probably won't need to bring an instrument.
If you plan to be playing a school instrument, be absolutely sure that your director knows this, and someone has made arrangements for you or another person to get it to camp.

, This would mainly include a sleeping bag, pillow, and flashlight, though you may also need other things. If you'll be at a camp that offers other activities besides band, such as swimming, pack accordingly.

, It's generally better to fit a lot of stuff in a couple of big suitcases or duffel bags than to have a lot of smaller ones. Try to get all your clothes and stuff into one bag, if possible, and another smaller one for your instrument-related stuff. That makes two bags, plus the instrument itself. Be sure to pack as efficiently as possible without ""stuffing"", as some of the things you'll be taking may break. If you're trying as hard as you can, and you can't make everything fit into two or three good-sized bags, maybe you need to leave some stuff out...

If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director’s viewpoint.

, In order for the marching band to look uniform, it’s important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps.


The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line.
You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you’re marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you., Each position in a drill chart corresponds to a count in the music. As the song progresses, you will move across the field into a new position. You will start on the count of 0 and generally move in increments of 8., 8-to-5 is the most common marching style. Every step is 22.5 inches. In other words, you will take 8 steps between every 5 yard line. You will start with your left foot and end on your right.


Another common style is the 6-to-5 style, which means 6 (30 inch) steps per 5 yards.

, Lift your leg high in the air with your thigh parallel to the ground and your calf vertical to the ground with your toes pointed. Break the step into 4 motions.


On the count of 1, lift your left heel off the ground, keeping your toes pointed.
On the count of 2, lift your left leg into a chair position, keeping your toes pointed.
On the count of 3, drop your left leg so the toe is pointed and the heel is off the ground.
On the count of 4, drop your left heel to the ground.
Repeat this for your right leg.

, Keep your legs straight while you march. Start by lifting and moving your left foot forward. Plant your heel into the ground first, keeping your foot straight so that your toes point up at an angle and so the bottom of your foot can be seen. Repeat for your right foot.


A roll step, also known as a glide step, is a way to march while keeping your instrument level so that it is easier to play.

, To march backwards, use the motions of the chair step. Bring each leg up into a chair position, then thrust the foot backwards. Always stay on the balls of your feet and keep your heels off the ground.

, Turn 90 degrees to the left, pivoting on the ball of your right foot. To do a right flank, turn 90 degrees to the right and pivot on your left foot.

, To perform a horn slide, you will only turn the upper half of your body instead of turning on the ball of your foot. Turn the upper half of your body (along with your horn) 90 degrees right or left, while keeping your legs and feet in the same position, marching in the same direction they were before, if you are marching.


For a lateral slide, do a left or right flank with the lower half of your body, but keep the upper half of your body facing the same direction as it was before.

, For percussionists, the crab step will substitute for a slide. To crab step to the left, on the count of 1 sidestep with your left foot over your right, taking about ¾ of a standard sized step. Then sidestep with your right foot, take a slightly larger 1¼ sized step so that you are moving at the same pace as the horn section who is taking standard sized steps each time.

, Make a sharp up-and-down motion with your head, which will cause the instrument to move up and down. This will accompany turning movements.

, Make a 90 degree turn in 4 counts.

, To halt, bring your feet back to the attention positing, beginning the movement with your right foot and ending on your left foot."

Talk to your parents about chaperoning.,
Understand how you will travel with your instrument.,
Make sure your band uniform will be ready for the trip, as you will very likely need to wear it.,

Pack all of your toiletries.,
Girls, bring whatever beauty supplies you need.,

If you're afraid of being embarrassed, keep in mind that you probably won't be the only kid with their parents on the trip.;
, Flutes, trumpets, oboes, smaller saxes, and clarinets will probably take their instruments as a carry-on on the plane. Tubas, trombones, French horns, baritones, bassoons, and larger saxes such as tenor and baritone will probably need to check their instruments in. Piccolos may be able to squeeze their case into their suitcase. Percussionists can put their stick bags in their luggage as well, as your band director will work out the plan for percussion equipment. Don't forget to bring your sheet music, either, especially if you're the only one with that specific part!

, Your band teacher will probably have already talked to you about this by now. Don't forget dress shoes, tights, a belt, or whatever else you need for it.

, Will there be snow? Rain? Will it be warm? Pack whatever you need to be comfortable in whatever weather awaits you.

, They will want to hear all about what cool things you're doing! Calling them at night is a good idea. Just make sure whatever you decide to do works with your parents' schedules and yours! Be aware of long-distance costs and whether your hotel supports long-distance calls. If you're in doubt, bring your cell phone!

, A special stuffed animal, a little pillow, or even your iPod can comfort you whenever you may feel homesick. Remember, everything seems gloomier at night, so bring something to help you go to sleep.

, Toothpaste and a toothbrush are essential! Most hotels have shampoo and body wash, but if you want to be safe, bring your own. Deodorant is also a good idea.

, Makeup, a brush or comb, etc. are good things to bring. You probably won't need to worry about a hairdryer, but you may need a diffuser. Are you going to pack your straightener, or will you borrow your roommate's? Let her know if you plan on borrowing; she may not want to share.

, Your Nintendo DS, your iPod, your book, your doodle journal, or a deck of cards are good things to bring. Be sure it won't be too loud; teachers and other passengers won't like that. You will also be responsible for any valuables you lose.

Research for yourself!",How to Become a Band Director," If you aren't or haven't already, get involved in your school's band program or other local and community music organizations.;
, The more varied your experience the better. Choirs and band programs are easily accessible and will all help to provide you with a well rounded growth experience, both musically and personally.

, You'll need to be proficient on at least one traditional band instrument .

,, Although it stinks, if you ever want to have any hope of becoming a band director that's worth his salt you must practice. You will have off days, and even weeks at some point. Times where you just don't feel like practicing, or are too discouraged to practice. Times like these are normal and you can't always force yourself to play. However, for every day that you don't practice, you lose 2 days of muscle memory and strength. This is especially true on brass instruments. The more you play the better your embouchure (lip placement and musculature) will become, and the better your tone, breathing, dexterity (finger speed), and muscle memory will become. SO even on those down days... try practicing at least once for 20 minutes or so if nothing else. 20 minutes - it's less than a TV show. Focus on learning your scales, producing a good tone using proper breathing, and your articulation (how you separate each note).

,, Musical compositions are just pieces of scales anyway.. but mixed up to make a melody. GET AN INSTRUCTOR if you can... although most school band programs provide at least some form of formal teaching.. however with the state of music education programs in the U.S. today.. school may not always be the best place to get ALL of your instruction from. Still.. keep at it. It's YOUR practice that counts anyway.

, Learn how to read, and sight read music. Sight reading is playing a piece that you've never seen before after looking at it for a minute and a half or less. This is a standard audition requirement. You'll need this skill.. and although you'll probably be Horrible at it for the first year or even three of learning your instrument.. if you practice consistently at least 4 to 5 days a week then you will recognize rhythms and notes so easily that sight reading music becomes as easy or easier than ""sight reading"" a book. Buy a basic music theory book to learn these skills. ""Notespeller"" is one good way to do this. However you won't be able to learn properly without taking lessons or having a good band director or other musically trained individual teach you.

, With lots of hard work, confidence, and the continued desire to become a band director, you'll eventually earn your degree and be properly trained to take the helm at your new school band program shortly after graduation .

Know your fundamentals of marching well.,
Have your uniform in order.,
Dress for maximum comfort.,
Keep hydrated and eat right.,
Know the song line-up.,
Stay in step.,
Use your peripheral vision and keep the lines dressed.,
After the parade, take care of your instrument, then sit down, rest your feet, and drink water to compensate for whatever you may have lost through sweating.",How to March in a Parade With a Marching Band," This may seem obvious, but depending on what your band was doing before the parade, a refresher course in marching 8/5 in a block may be in order. You may also have to perform basic moves that aren't used much in shows, which some members (especially the rookies) might not remember.;
, Be sure to know what you're supposed to wear, especially if your band has multiple uniforms (for instance, a casual summer uniform and a full uniform). If you have to wash anything, make sure you do so well in advance. Girls may need to braid or otherwise style their hair. Your band director may ask you to not wear any jewelry if the parade is on the somber side. If it's a themed or holiday parade (like a holiday parade), you might be asked to wear a Santa hat or something else for the occasion. If you like this idea and nobody's said anything, suggest it yourself!

, Wear thick socks that will cushion your feet. Pick comfortable clothes to wear under your uniform pants (if applicable). If you're allowed to, you may wish to wear sunglasses. In an extremely casual parade (meaning no uniform to speak of), wear loose-fitting, light colored clothing, the sturdiest shoes you own, and you might even be able to pull off a water backpack.

, Drink lots of water the day before and the morning of the parade. Drink water as much as possible right up until the moment you step off. If possible, keep a bottle of it somewhere in your uniform, or wear a water backpack if it is allowed. Avoid dairy products right before the parade, because they'll make you sick if you're out in the sun for a long period of time.

, Getting lost or playing the wrong song during a parade can be very confusing and embarrassing. If possible and necessary, try to write it on whichever hand you'll have the best view of. If you'll be marching with a flipbook, put your music in order before the day of the parade.

, If you step off at the right time and keep the beat under your feet, this shouldn't be a problem. However, you might want to look down at the person's feet in front of you or at the drum major (if yours is marching backwards and conducting) every once in a while. Remember, odd numbered beats are ""left"", evens are ""right"" (in key signatures based on multiples of four... this doesn't work in 3/4). If you realize you're out of step, try to do a subtle skip or change your step size for a moment to fix it.

, You will most likely be marching in a large block. The whole time you're moving, you'll have to frequently check to make sure you're still in line with the people in front of you and on either size of you, you're still in your diagonal, and the intervals between people are still correct. Your peripheral vision will also allow you to see any incoming clowns or others who are trying to be funny by messing with your instrument (glare at them, and if that doesn't work, get rid of them as discreetly as possible).

, Congratulations, it's over!

Before you graduate, age out, or otherwise move on, train your successor and give him or her an opportunity to practice.",How to Be a Drum Major," You will be out in front of the band or corps marching solo, all eyes on you, so you must exemplify your group's marching style. Posture and form are key. Your technique will also set the example for the whole group.

Pay particular attention to being able to march backwards confidently if you will face the group to conduct in parades. Work on maintaining a full stride, and trust that the ground is not going anywhere. If you will march backwards to conduct, also practice turning to march forwards for your salute. Remember to figure in about four steps before your flourish for your turn.
Do not advertise your errors. If you do make a mistake during a performance, recover as quickly as possible and proceed as though nothing had happened. Maintaining your poise and confidence will go a long way toward lessening the impact of a mishap.
;
, Pay special attention to dynamics and timing, since these are the elements you will be called upon to interpret and set for the group. It is essential that you know how to follow a conductor before you can be one. You don't necessarily have to be first-chair of your section. Unless a solo is required for your drum major audition, you don't need to worry about how well you perform on your instrument. Focus only on reading, explaining, and conducting the score clearly., Two- and four- beat patterns are essential and cover most marches, but if you will have to conduct the Star Spangled Banner, you will need to be comfortable conducting in three. Depending on the complexity of your show, other meters may be necessary. Ask your band or corps director or a previous drum major for instruction. You can practice conducting to a recording of your band's music or other recorded music.

Unlike conducting an orchestra, conducting as a drum major is generally done with a flat or slightly-curved hand, fingers together. You may even wish to try taping your middle, ring, and pinky fingers together loosely with white surgical tape or black electrical tape to match your gloves (you'll need your index finger for pointing). Whatever conducting style you use, remember that it will need to have a clean appearance and be visible from a distance.
Once you have mastered the basic patterns for different meters, work on giving dynamics and cues. Bigger, more emphatic gestures indicate louder, heavier playing.
Only subdivide when the band needs a cue for each eighth note. Otherwise, subdivision of the beat can confuse the band as to where the count is.
Work on stops and starts, both by yourself and with the group. Give a pick-up or lead-in beat, followed by a downbeat to start. Give a cut gesture to stop. When working with the group, ensure that they interpret your gestures correctly and that attacks and releases are clean.
Before beginning each new song or stepping off, get the tempo in your mind by mentally singing the song.
Ask the director for guidance on appropriate waits between songs in a field show. Make sure that color guards, drill teams, and others have time to reset and change equipment if they need to.
Be expressive. You will cue your group to get louder or softer, faster or slower, more legato or more staccato. Let that come through in your gestures.
Conduct all sections, not just your own. If you have spent the past 3 years playing trombone, you may tend to zero in on the low brass parts, facing them more often, giving them more cues. Practice listening and conducting to the entire group as a whole. (This includes the percussion and color guard or drill team. They are important parts of your group, too.)
When you first get the position as drum major, stick with conducting styles that your band is used to seeing. A sudden change from the previous drum major may make it difficult to follow. Once your band gets a hang of the show, you can begin to add in individual styles and cues that make your conducting unique.

, Just as with memorizing the music to play your part, you must know when the music will start and stop, when to cue for entrances, cuts and dynamics, when any measures change meter, and so on. Get a recording of your song or show and practice to that. Learn to read a score, too., The style varies between Scottish/British and American groups. Make sure you get yours right. Whatever your salute, practice it in front of a mirror or reflective glass window or door. Aim for crisp, clean, and confident motions. Get so you can feel when your wrists are straight and your positioning and angles are correct.

If your salute will be accompanied by a flourish, rehearse it and create a routine that you can do easily and consistently. A simple flourish done cleanly is better than a fancy flourish that is fumbled or dropped.
Don't forget the hand that's not saluting. Whatever its position (holding a baton or mace, straight by your side, or bent) make sure that is deliberate and firm, not dangling absently. The hand, too, should be firmly and precisely positioned.
Watch your drill team, color guard, and even cheerleaders for presents and flourishes you can incorporate. All these groups have visual elements that you can use for inspiration, and restyle into something that is your own.
Take into account your distance from the audience and the judges. Perform larger, more visible elements when at a distance and smaller, more detailed elements when close up.
Don't make your salute too long or too short. Also, don't perform it too fast or too slow. Make sure your motions can easily be seen, but don't seem lazy or unenthusiastic by going too slow.

, Again, the key is practice, and the style varies. The most important part is timekeeping. When keeping time, make sure that the angle of the baton or mace stays consistent throughout the range of motion.





 Full regalia.

If you will use a baton or mace, practice in your uniform before you perform. This goes double for any uniform involving a kilt, cape, or other feature that could interfere with your motions. Knocking off your hat or mooning the judges will not impress anybody.

, Attend a beginning band camp if you don't remember how to explain basics for your group. Try to remember how it felt to you to learn marching, and lead your new members through practice patiently., Drum majors are often called upon to help teach the drill. Practice a standard stride if you need it to measure positions.,

Shout from the diaphragm.
Find a pitch that is comfortable for you. If you change the pitch of your voice to give commands, it should be to lower it somewhat.
Remember that the rhythm of the command gives the group the cadence for executing the command. Give commands at a moderate, consistent tempo. Step off at a tempo that leads into the music.
If you're having trouble with shouting from the diaphragm, put your hand on your stomach and breathe in. If it is expanding, you're breathing correctly. You should be able to take a large, full breath. When you shout, you should feel your abdomen tightening as it pushes the air out.
Don't cut each word off early, and don't drag each word out too long. You'll know when you do this, and so will the band.

, Especially in parades, the group may be too spread out or the crowd may be too noisy for vocal commands to carry adequately. In these cases, you'll need to start the group with your whistle.

Whistle commands work on rhythm. Practice these rhythms.
Whistle commands should be fortissimo. Use plenty of air and support from the diaphragm.
Whistle commands should be crisp. Articulate and tongue as though you were playing a wind instrument. Stop the air just as abruptly.

Lanyards and rubber whistle covers are available in a variety of common pageantry colors. The former will keep your whistle from falling; the latter will make it more comfortable to bite down a bit.
Invest in a proper whistle. They are not that expensive, and a good one will carry much more loudly and cleanly than a poor one.
Never spit out your whistle or let it drop to your chest. Rather, make a deliberate and controlled gesture of lifting your whistle with your hand and setting it down. Do the reverse to place the whistle back in your mouth.
Close the door or go somewhere far from others. Plug your ears, and actually practice.
Your whistle is also an excellent tool for regaining attention and order should a rehearsal get out of hand.
Practice with the group. The group also needs to know how to respond to whistle commands.
Practice any hand or baton gestures that go with whistle commands.

, Besides looking your best, you set the standard for your group.

Make sure that you know and can explain the correct arrangement of hats, epaulets, citation cords, cummerbunds, and any other pieces of your uniform.
Corral loose hair under your hat and spray, braid, or trim it as necessary.
Keep shoes, gloves, and gauntlets polished and all uniform parts clean. Dry clean your uniform at regular intervals. Wash your gloves with bleach and replace them if necessary.
The drum major may shed his or her hat during a field show. If you choose to do this, make sure the hair underneath it is trim and tidy. Do not set it where it will fall off a podium or get marched over.

, Practice in your uniform, especially it has elements you're not used to wearing, such as a cape.

Use a step stool or ladder if you need to.
Make sure anybody who erects your podium for you knows how to do so securely.
Practice marking time without drifting around on your podium.

, If you will be accepting awards on behalf of your group, do it properly. When your group is announced, approach the presenter(s). March in step with your entourage, if you have one. Perform a short salute, flourish or present (awards ceremonies are long and tedious enough as it is), then leave formation. Shake the presenter's hand with your right hand while accepting the award with your left. Pause and pose for photos if anyone is taking them. Then, return to your entourage and return to your station, placing the award on the ground beside you.,


Lead by example, then by instruction. The drum major is also a leader. Demonstrate your dedication to the group and to the performance. Show up early and stay late. Help set things up and take things down before and after rehearsals.
Respect the chain of command. While it's perfectly all right to bring a problem or concern to the attention of the director or other staff, try to resolve any major disagreements privately and discreetly. You undermine your authority and that of your director, otherwise.
Likewise, listen to your group members and any section leaders or assistant drum majors. If somebody approaches you with a problem, do your best to address it. Be responsive to peoples' needs and accommodate what you can. If something is beyond your control, explain to the group what you know about the situation and ask their assistance and forbearance, as appropriate.
If there are band members that are not giving you respect for whatever reason, keep your temper and do not give them a personal reason to not like you. Many upperclassmen may not want to listen to a drum major that is younger than them, or there may be unresolved differences between you and that person outside of band practice. Remember that you have some dominance over them, but you must also remain calm and in control. If you need to, calmly remind them that a band must work together to be successful, and they are preventing that from happening by not listening and not being respectful towards you. If needed, get help from your band director, and they can take action in a much more efficient way.
Provide constructive criticism. Try whenever possible to direct comments at the whole group rather than at individuals: ""Everybody, chins up and watch your horn angles."" Favor positive statements (""lift your chest"") over negative ones (""don't slouch""). If you must single somebody out, do so discreetly and don't make a big deal out of it. Make comments as detached and neutral as possible. Then, give people an opportunity to practice and learn.
Be generous with compliments. Compliments are often more powerful than criticism. If somebody is doing something well, or has improved, say so. It's okay to single somebody out for the good news, or tell the whole group. It will help everybody be more confident and it will encourage people to try harder. It will also improve morale.
Avoid marginalizing anyone or playing favorites. It's fine, even healthy, to have friends in the group, but when you are acting in the capacity of drum major, hold them to the same standards as everyone else.
Make an effort to learn the names of everybody in your group. Trust and respect work best when they go both ways.
Explaining things clearly. Go step-by-step, literally if need be. If you are getting blank looks or a lot of questions, try again. Be specific and give demonstrations.
Notice or recall what you like and dislike about directors and drum majors you have worked with. Analyze their styles. What was effective? What wasn't? What was fun? What was miserable? Your priorities should be first to do your job and second to please people. While you can't possibly please everyone, your group will be easiest to lead and it will perform its best if the people in it are generally satisfied and confident about your performance.
Be a part of your group as much as possible. There will be times when you do act independently as part of your duties, but make an effort to do what they do. Rehearse and perform when they do. Eat when and what they eat, and if you are traveling, sleep where they sleep. Most importantly, don't carry on as though you are above them or apart from them.
Take control when necessary. Keep your temper, but act for the good of the group, and don't be overly concerned about being everybody's friend.

,

Practice timing and have somebody time you if necessary.
For field shows, there is typically a given amount of time to set up. Listen to the announcer for the cue to salute (typically ""Drum Major, is the band/corps ready?""). Salute, then begin the show promptly.
For parades and parade competitions, aim to salute while passing the judges' stand. Practice starting any flourishes or embellishments so that the salute itself happens right in front of the judges. A good rule of thumb, if none is given, is to salute for a given number of paces (perhaps eight to twelve) preceding and following the center of the judges' stand.
If you have the opportunity before a performance, scout the parade route or venue in advance. Pass on any relevant warnings (obstructions, terrain, etc.) to your group.

,

Ask your director or others to critique your performance.
Read judging sheets and listen to judging tapes if they are available, both for you and for your group. They will tell you what needs improvement. Pay particular attention to any comment you get repeatedly.
There will be times when you should take judges' comments with a grain of salt. Parades, especially, may be judged by volunteers or local VIPs who know as much about marching bands as they do about horses, floats, and classic cars, which is to say very little. All judging is somewhat qualitative, and most of it is rushed. Don't take it too personally; do work to improve whatever you can.

, Let him or her lead a late-season parade or two, or conduct a segment of a field show when the group is facing backfield. Pass on what you have learned."

",How to Start an Emo Band in Middle School," You can't start an emo band unless you know emo music. First of all, the following bands are emo: Rites of Spring, Embrace, The Hated, Sunny Day Real Estate, Dashboard Confessional, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Jimmy Eat World, I Hate Myself, Saetia, American Football, Texas is the Reason, Matchbook Romance, Silverstein, Evanescence, etc.;
, This goes without saying. You can play guitar, bass, drums or sing, whichever one you are good at.

, Make sure they want to be in an emo band. It wouldn't be too good if they all showed up for practice and wanted to play hardcore punk now would it? Also try to get friends at the same musical level as each other, for it will help you develop as a band.

, Try to make sure your whole band agrees on it. The name should be 2-4 words long. A good name will have your listeners thinking (e.g. The Academy Is... ""What is the academy?""; Jimmy Eat World ""What in god's name could that mean?"") Also do not use an emo band name generator. Those are made by people who only wish they had enough talent to start a band.

, This really can't be stressed enough. Find a garage or something and practice, practice, practice!

, It helps to write the songs together, collaboration never hurts. Your songs should be emotional and should derive from styles like post-hardcore, indie, alternative or even pop punk or hardcore.

, Most people will want to hear you.

, They will help you get noticed more widely. Back in the day Myspace was a good bet but now be prepared with Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram.

You must have a strong music theory background in order to communicate with the band's director and with the musicians, especially if they have questions or concerns about the score.;
, The conductor is essentially a metronome for the band. Your role will be to keep everyone on time during play. In a larger sense, too, you'll be in a leadership role. Musicians and directors will rely on you to help coordinate practices and performances.


Conductors should avoid marking time with their feet, since this could send mixed signals. Instead, just direct the band with your hand cues., You'll be responsible for getting the band to meet goals and effectively play as a single unit. This requires balancing schedules, personalities, memorizing music and field positions, all while coordinating with the director.


Consider if you're willing to commit the large amount of time it takes to conduct a marching band. You should arrive early to practices and stay late to answer any questions or concerns the band or director may have. You may need to help out a musician in your free time or simply be there for support during stressful times., Can you easily interact with your peers, as well as authority figures? A large part of conducting a band requires that you act as the liaison between band director and the musicians. For this reason, you must also be respected by all.


Respect is a critical part of conducting. The director must have confidence in your ability to carry out his or her directions. At the same time, musicians should not question your commands or musical ability. Instead, they should acknowledge your musical experience and leadership abilities., Band directors vary in terms of how directly involved they are with their band. It's your job to discuss the practical running of the band with the director. You will need to work with the musicians to meet goals set by the director. The director must respect you and your concerns. Likewise, you should respect the director's requests and decisions.


Realize that this won't always be easy. You'll need to be able to handle criticism, both from the director and from your peers. You must also be comfortable with discussing problems or concerns with fellow musicians.

, This goes hand and hand with respect. You should be able to command the attention of your musicians while inspiring them to perform at their best. This requires you to exude confidence and be there to provide encouragement and feedback.Being enthusiastic and passionate about the band is critical in order to inspire your musicians. Showing your excitement and enjoyment of the music and performances will signal to your musicians that you appreciate what they do. They'll also be more likely to invest time and energy into the band if they feel that they're part of a larger community that cares. It's your job to be the role model of that community., In addition to motivating the band musically, you should set an example when it comes to neatness and appearance. Make sure your uniform is clean, wrinkle-free, and properly buttoned or fastened. Presenting a well-kept image tells the musicians that you take your job seriously and expect them to as well.


Obviously, you won't always need to wear your uniform. For rehearsals and practices, wear something comfortable, but avoid looking disheveled. The band is still looking to you for guidance and you'll still be interacting with the band's director. Maintain a professional attitude regardless of the situation.
You'll also need to be physically fit since conducting is physically demanding. You may be required to conduct while marching forward or backwards, run up and down the field, and even carry a baton or mace while marching.You might also have to run around on a large field, given the size and movement requirements of a marching band.

, Depending on the band's needs, you'll probably have to incorporate facings, turns, salutes, and bows while conducting the band. These can be relatively straightforward and simple movements or you can make them as elaborate and complicated as you like.


Practice your style in front of a large mirror. Remember that you'll be raised up on the field and visible to the audience. Make sure your movements are comfortable and easy to execute while wearing your uniform.
Developing a style can personalize your role as drum major, it's not a vital part of conducting the band., Again, these can be simple, clean movements or elaborate emphatic gestures. Consider what's easiest for your band to understand and follow. You should make your gestures large enough for the band to see. For this reason, you should keep your fingers together, not spread apart. This avoids confusion or misdirection.Try conducting other songs in your time signature to get use to how it feels. When you are completely comfortable with one time signature, practice several songs in another more challenging signature. You can also ask your director for any variations or pieces to practice.

, To conduct in counts of two, bring your hands down to hit a focal point, then bring them back up. While this may seem like the simplest time signature to conduct, you should avoid bringing your hands straight up. Instead, bring both of your hands down, then sweep your hands to the side while bringing them back up on the second count.Regardless of what time signature you're conducting, keep your arms at a 45 degree angle with your palms slightly raised at about a 45 degree angle. You should practice choosing and hitting a focal point that will be the basis for your conducting patterns. When starting out, you might want to use a physical focal point, such as music stands set at waist level. This will allow you to become comfortable with hitting the same point when conducting.

, For conducting three, bring your hands down, then out to the sides, and back up. Specifically, you'll bring both of your hands straight down, stopping at about belly button level or whatever focal point you've chosen. On the second beat, move your arms from the focal point out to your sides. On the third beat, bring your hands up to the starting position.You should bounce your hand just slightly when you hit the beats, regardless of what time signature you're conducting. This lets your musicians know that you're on the beat and not just moving towards it..

, For conducting four beats, move your arms down to your focal point on beat one. Move then in on beat two, making sure your hands don't touch. Move them out to your sides on beat three, before bringing your hands back up for beat four.


It's important that you mark each beat by emphasizing or slightly bouncing your hands as you hit the beat. Otherwise, your musicians might be confused as to where your hands are moving in relation to the time.

, While it's up to you to develop what style you'd like to use for these gestures, the overall goals are the same. Cues are used to signal to a specific section or member of the band. Cut-offs signal the end of the piece or of a section. To cut off, bring your arms out in opposite directions and up to form a circle. When you reach the top of the circle, bring your fists together and tightly pull them apart horizontally.


Your gesture to cut off, or end the performance, should be one of your largest movements. You want to make sure that the entire band sees that the music is coming to a close. This is especially important if the band is dispersed across a large field.
Your signalling cue can be as simple as using your index finger to point to a specific member or section. Use a gesture that feels comfortable to you and effectively communicates your directions to the musicians.

, This requires you to know where each section is on the field at any given point during the piece. You'll need to know when to cue sections, so don't lose track of your band. Eye contact is incredibly helpful here, as you'll often be signaling to only one section, not the entire band.


Don't get carried away with overly large gesturing and emphasis. It will be difficult to maintain during a long performance and the band won't be able to determine subtleties in the music."

Design a band logo and brand.",How to Start a Simple Rock Band with Friends," To begin with, keep things very simple, so that you can make the most of existing skills and don't have to outlay money on expensive gear. At the most basic, have at least one singer, a drummer, a guitarist and a bassist. If someone can play music using an electronic keyboard, you can narrow down the instrument range and rely mostly on that as a backing source.


Do you want more than one singer? This can be a sensible thing if you have more than one person wanting to sing––give everyone a chance.
Do you have enough talent among your friends? If not, source the missing element from friends of friends.
Be sure to know what you want to do and reserve it for yourself, but do discuss this with your friends in case you're clashing with someone else also wanting the same role. Keep your friendships intact by being willing to compromise and share.;
, Hopefully everyone already comes with their instruments and a fair amount of learning. If not, source cheap versions from auctions, secondhand stores or borrow from people you trust and who are willing to trust you to take good care of the instruments.


Learn quickly and practice a lot if you are new to the instrument. Lessons can help, or check out online lessons through sites like YouTube.

, Do you want to play classic rock, punk rock, heavy metal, the blues, pop? You'll need a good group discussion on this. If everyone has different tastes, you might need to compromise and try all styles until you find the one that fits you all as a group playing together.

, You'll need a regular time and a regular place. This means choosing somewhere that the noise level won't bother others, so be thoughtful about this. Always ask permission if parents/guardians/teachers are involved.


Get everyone's contact details. Have both phone and email details, so that you can send messages as well as have quick confirmation chats.

, This is the drudge part but you can make it fun because you're with friends, you're all being creative together and some really good stuff can metamorphose from those hours and hours of practice. So be prepared to put in the time and effort, have plenty of breaks and some good snack food.


Keep things fun. Otherwise, you'll find band members stop turning up. All hard work makes this a boring endeavor and everyone's a volunteer after all.

, Do you want to just cover existing songs or do you want to write your own songs? It's probably simpler to start with covering existing songs, especially for the sake of practice sessions and getting to know each other's styles and limitations. But as time goes on, you may find that some band members want to try original songs, and will start penning a few down. Be open minded about the possibilities.


Once you start making your own music, write it down and record it. Nothing worse than having great ideas disappear because nobody thought to capture them adequately.
Use computer mixing software to add interesting elements to original music.

, When all of you decide it's time to stick together and try out the wider scene of live play and even seeking a recording opportunity, develop a brand identity together. Again, keep this a democratic decision and choose logos, themes and colors that everyone can live with.

, You'll need at least one of each; singer, drummer, bassist, and guitarist.

, Let all of the members brainstorm, narrow down the selections, and pick a name. Agree upon a single name. Most punk bands start with, ""the."" Keep that in mind. It doesn't matter what the band's name is as long as everyone accepts it.

, Find a place to practice, such as someone's garage, or rent out an old warehouse. If your drummer has a garage with their own drum set, practice here (it's a hassle to move around a drum set).

, Punk covers a variety of different styles, so while you're jamming with the band, pick one that best reflects everyone's skills and interests.

Pay attention to different styles of other previous bands around you such as: Descendents, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Unseen, Misfits, Bad Religion, Rancid, The Adicts, etc.







, Don't just play covers, write a dozen or so songs of your own music and lyrics to start. Figure out the instrumental parts of the songs as well, but focus on the lyrics. Make sure everyone is capable of playing the music and ensure it flows well when played by your band.

, Play each song you wrote as much as possible. When you're happy with it, release it to the public. There are many independent labels that have their own MP3 sites for amateur bands., Encourage everyone to contribute and invest in the band, as it gives them a sense of ownership.

, Could be old school punk, ska punk, hardcore and even pop-punk. You could also play a mix of different sub-genres. As long as It's what you enjoy doing and you are playing in front of the right crowd. And It's OK to switch style, just don't be a sellout and still play a couple of your older style but don't focus so much on if fans are getting disappointing

Follow up with the people you sent it to in a week or 2.

",How to Make a Band Press Kit," Many bands try a few names before finding the right one. You want all the material in the kit to have 1 name and preferably reviews, stickers, a promo or other information all referring to just 1 name, so you don't confuse a person that may have no more than a few seconds to peruse your material. (If you are a solo performer, all you need to do is come up with a stage name);
, In order to create a professional image that people will want to take a closer look at, you will possibly need to spend money on paper products, promotional material, disc creation and more.

Your budget will probably need to be between $200 and $1,500 depending upon your need to hire a manager and/or photographer and the number of people to whom you plan to send the press kit.

, With music recording software available for home computers, it does not need to be recorded in a studio; however, it should be clear quality. Include the band/artist titles and a page with the song's lyrics in your kit.

, This person should ideally be the front contact for all communication for the band/artist and be in possession of a frequently-checked email and phone. This person should also be able to find addresses to send the kit and be industrious enough to call on your behalf.

, You will need all the promotional material to follow this concept. Avoid gimmicky imagery.

, This logo does not need to be complicated. It can involve no more than a typeface that you use on all your material and a set of colors, but try to enlist the aid of a graphic designer, if possible, to create something you are proud of using on stickers, t-shirts and your press kit.

, Although you can, and should, put this information on other informative material, a small business card is more easily saved than an entire folder. Business cards can be made for less than $50 using online companies.

, Hire a professional photographer, if it is within your budget. The photo should be a clear picture of the artist and/or band members that you would like to appear in newspapers for upcoming shows.


Print out 8 by 10 inch glossy photographs to put in the press kit. Newspapers and magazines should be sent a glossy black and white photo. Music industry reps should be sent a colored picture.
Keep a digital copy of your photograph in both color and black and white to send to online and print events calendars.

, This is a 1 page informational sheet about your band that should include a paragraph about the music background of the band's members and your collective history. If you don't have someone in or around the group who is a very good writer, you may want to hire someone to do a professional write-up.

, A fact sheet contains sales figures, concert venues and dates, the sizes of your past shows' crowds, festivals and tours in a visually pleasing, easy to read list. This should never be more than 1 page.

, If you do not have quotes from newspaper reviews or emails, then your band manager will need to solicit this information by sending your music to people who can review it or asking previous venues to make a statement.


If you are just starting out, you can combine the fact and quote sheets together into 1 page.

, Include your band manager's contact information on every piece of the promotion kit. If you use photo copies to stay in budget, they should not be grainy.

, The folder should match your band/artist's colors and have the band's/artist logo on the front. Feel free to include promotional materials like a sticker or button.


Many folders come with a place to hold a business card, which can add a very professional look to the package.

, Put a press or music contact address label on the front and send it out.


Consider choosing an envelope that you think will stand out in a pile of envelopes on the desk of a music executive.
Go to the post office before you send your first envelopes to ensure you have the right amount of postage on your package.

Be able to play an instrument or sing.,
Name your band.,
Put up notices; this is a great way of getting the message around that you want to start a band.,
Don't just have your friends or girlfriend/boyfriend in the band for the reason that you like them.,
Going back to the friends thing- only have people in the band if they can do something.,
Once you have some replies to your notice (hopefully you'll have sorted out a place for the auditioners to meet you), go along and meet them!,
Once you've all the people you want, usually a bassist, a drummer, at least one lead guitarist, and a vocalist, you'll need to have a good grasp on writing songs and a basic level of knowledge on how a song is structured.,
Go to the writing desk!,

Have fun.",How to Start a Rock Band in High School," If you can't do either, you can learn an instrument, or take singing lessons. Bass is a good one to learn, since it's not too hard for most songs. Singing lessons could be costly, but it's worth it if you really want to start a band, right?;
, Use a name that sounds cool, or means something to you. Once you actually have a band, discuss the name, because it's usually the whole band who chooses the name. You don't want to be accused of having all the fun, because if you argue with your band, you may as well just give up.

, Make sure it's okay with the head teacher, or whoever it is in charge of that kind of thing. Putting the notices on a music department notice board is good, since people interested in music are going to be looking at it. Consider putting ""band practice"" or ""band auditions"" in large, bold font to attract the reader's attention. It's all advertising, right? Would you stop to read an advert if it hadn't caught your eye? Make the notice as big and bright as possible.

, If you have an argument with your friend or split up with your girlfriend/boyfriend, you'll be screwed, especially if they played a big part like vocals or lead guitar, because rock isn't rock without a guitarist, right?

, If they can hardly play drums and you need a drummer, don't just ask the first person available, you can live without a drummer for a while, so long as you have a good bassist and a (optional) metronome to practice with, you'll be fine. If the opportunity comes along, great, get in there and seize your chance, but if not, you'll probably just have to get on with the band.

, If no one is what you're looking for, make the deadline a little longer, but if you find all the right people, lucky you! Take down the notices or modify them to say that all the places are taken. Here is a common mistake that a lot of people make when forming a band:they only use the people who look the part. Obviously portraying the band's image in a good way is mandatory, but work on that later, why choose looks over talent? If that guy with heavy eyebrows is a drum prodigy, why choose the guy with lovely golden curls when he's an average, maybe even below average, drummer?

, Yes, that means reading and researching. Sorry! But you didn't expect to just start writing songs and be amazing, did you? Most songs go like this:


Verse 1
Bridge (optional)
Chorus
Verse 2
Chorus
Bridge (optional)
Chorus (repeated two to four times)

, You can start off by covering songs of your favorite artists, or artists who are similar to you, or you can start writing right now. It's better to start writing straight away, because then you can only get better and better. It's good to cover some songs too though, especially is you've got writers block. It happens to all of us, even huge songwriters can get stuck. To write a song, think of a ""story line"". Maybe something that's happened to you that made you angry, upset, or happy. It's a good idea to not make the song scream this out, but making the song based around the event makes the listener intrigued (that's why they go on the Internet and find out what the meanings are of their favorite songs). It's also a lot easier if you and the band sit together and brainstorm ideas, then you can all share experiences and therefore making songwriting a little easier because you might have a great experience but it could be painfully difficult to write about.

, Write down, on separate pieces of paper so you don't get confused, all the emotions, thoughts, and bits of memory that come through when you think about your experience. This could be a bad example, but let's just pretend for a minute that a few years ago you went on, say, the world's highest, scariest roller coaster. Think about what you would remember the most. Was it when you were getting on and you were scared stupid, or when you got off. Yep, you guessed it- getting on, because you were so scared it sticks out in your mind and you'll probably never forget it.

, Now you've got some lines! It's much easier to start off with a chorus, so now all the main work is done. If you sing it and it sounds good and you can't get it out of your head, great! You've successfully created a catchy chorus. And what's the thing that most people remember about their favorite songs? That's right; the chorus.

, It might take a while to get it fit into a tune, but again, if it sounds good, you've hit the nail on the head. It doesn't matter if all the lines make sense, but they should be more or less related. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of making things rhyme for the heck of it. The basic ""two lines rhyme, then the next two rhyme with a different ending"" is good. Even words that rhyme only a little (Manage me I'm a mess/ Turn a page, I'm a book half unread- All Time Low - Weightless) work well.

, This probably the easiest part of composing a song, but putting actual layers in the song is sometimes devilishly hard. Where should we put a dramatic pause? Or guitar riff? Is the lead guitarist going to do a solo? Should there be a part where there is no background music and then there is a line sung A Capella? How is the drum beat going to go? More importantly- how is the bassline going to go? What guitar tune should we put in the back? All huge questions, all difficult to answer, but it only comes with time. Sit down with the band and discuss the songs on by one. Ask your fellow bandmates to write down anything that they come up with, whether it be in Chemistry class, while practicing completed songs, or while playing a video game. Never leave it- always write down your ideas, because there's nothing worse than having an amazing idea, only to lose it in your mind. Meanwhile, focus on writing more songs and get some venues.

, Obviously while you're just starting off don't expect people to let you just perform at the local gig. Start off with school assemblies. if people like you, awesome! You have fans! When you get pretty good, see if you can get a gig locally. Don't expect to be performing at Warped Tour! Hire a venue if you can. Maybe a city hall or anything available of a similar description. This might be a little costly, but make sure the people who come and watch you leave with some awesome music ringing in their ears. You want them to like you as soon as they look at you. So smile, have a stage presence and a sense of humor. Poke fun at yourself, saying things like you've never performed properly before and so excuse you if you're pretty bad. Put on a good show, and it will be worth the money you paid for the venue, because the people coming to watch you will have fun, but more importantly you'll have an insanely awesome time that you'll want to relive over and over again. If you're enjoying yourself, let the audience know it! Smile, dance crazily and look like you're having so much fun it's almost criminal.

, Once you have your first gig, let people know about it. Put up posters on community notice board.

, ""Yeah, I did. BUT..."" But nothing. If there's a ""but"" after they say ""yes"", you need to work on things. Get their opinion and work around that. If they say that they don't like the music, that is their choice. Tell yourself that if one person doesn't like it, then they're missing out!

, It's hard at first to have ideas, but just keep trying! If you're passionate about your rock band, then you'll stick it out until the end. Being in a band makes you develop a superglue bond with your bandmates. You'll go through hell and high water with them. Remember when Bob Bryar left My Chemical Romance? Everyone was very sad, but look how far My Chemical Romance has come since then. Remember when Brownsound left Sum 41? It was awful! But Sum 41 carried on and made great music. What I'm saying is that even if one of the band leaves, it's not the end of the world (however it is a very good idea to have two guitarists so if one leaves, you have a backup), just struggle through it until you can find a replacement. The best bands have had some sort of struggle. My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way's drug problem- he got over it and he now feels squeaky clean. Josh and Zac Farro leaving Paramore - they got over it. Just remember to love your music and have a good time.

With other positions like keyboardist, acoustic guitarist or tambourinist, which are not used very commonly. A lot of Alternative Rock groups mainly focus on guitars. For example, Coldplay use a vast style of guitarists. Usually there are at least one guitarist and bass player, but ideally, you could have two guitarists and a bass guitarist. It is vital that you have a drummer and a singer, and it is quite helpful with a keyboardist.;

If you're playing for a lot of fans and friends or at a big parties, you still want to confirm the basic details.;
, Don't rely on someone else, unless they know what you have and have a detailed list of what you need. Do make a list for everything; you will forget something, particularly if you haven't had a gig before.

, Broken gear can be easily replaced before you go on stage, and is less embarrassing.

, Knowing exactly what you're going to play and when will help all band members be on the same page. Find out how long you have on stage, and whether you can expect to play an encore, so that you can plan what songs to play. It's a good idea to have a few more songs ready to go too, in case you end up with extra time to fill.

, This should go without saying, but if you're going to play a gig, you need to practice. Make sure you and the other band members have practiced together enough to actually sound good; it's very unlikely you'll play a great gig without rehearsal.

, If some time has passed since you booked the event, confirm a few days before that you're actually playing when you think you are. The order that different bands are going on for a show or festival can often change at the last minute, as can the exact timing. So it doesn't hurt to touch base.

, Amps and PA systems will blow up at the worst possible times, broken strings will happen, even acoustic drums will tear their drum heads. Bring exact spares with you so that when something happens, you are prepared.

, For the best possible sound quality, remember that people hear better directly in front of them and at their sides of their heads, so set up where the audience can hear you.


Also try to mic up your amps along with getting your drummer electronic drums so that you can turn down their volume.

, Don't jam or talk too much on stage. Interact with the crowd, so that they will remember you more. Don't be too serious on stage either or curse or do silly things; the chances of you playing there again are next to none if you're just starting out and behave that way.

Take every opportunity to practice that you get.,
Find your inner rock star.,
Learn from the greats.,
Record your performances.",How to Have a Good Stage Presence1," Practice will make you feel confident at a big show, and the more venues you get to play in, the better. Practice alone at home, practice with your band, practice in front of the mirror, play for your mom, your friends, anyone who will listen. The more practice, the less of chance you’ll mess up when it counts.

]

Get lots of experience playing different shows. Don’t wait around for a big opportunity to present itself. Look for little gigs at local, smaller venues that feature your musical style. It’s a great way to build confidence, and also a lot of fun.
For actors, practice your lines until you can recite them in your sleep. The more comfortable you feel with the logistical parts of your performance such as lines and body movements, the more you can focus on being emotionally convincing and adopting your character’s persona on stage. ;
, No matter what kind of performance you’re involved in, from theater to music to dance, the most important trait to have on stage is confidence. Even if you’re a bit more reserved in real life, on stage, let yourself become passionate and energetic. For softer music such as indie or folk, it’s still important to show the audience that you’re engaged and having a good time. Don’t just stand still and play even if it’s a slow, quiet song. Move to the music, interact with your band mates, and convey emotion through your face.
For louder music, it’s important to really let loose. For music such as punk and heavy metal, don’t be afraid to scream in both high and low registers, and jump around. For hip hop or rap, make sure to use clear, audible enunciation, and vary the cadence of your voice. If you speak or sing in monotone, the crowd will think you’re not confident in your music.
Remember that the crowd will only be as enthusiastic as you are. If your facial expression, body language, voice, and musicality show that you’re 100% into the music, the crowd will be, too.

, Watch and attend performances of bands, actors, or dances that you idolize. See what kinds of tricks and riffs musicians use on stage, and mimic some of their best techniques. Study the behaviors of actors and dancers that captivate audiences, and adopt their body language. Remember, the point isn’t to steal what’s already been done, but to learn from past successes and synthesize what works well with your own unique sound and image. If you can’t make it to live events, watch Youtube performances. Watch videos of your favorite bands, actors, and dancers to get tips on movements and styles. You can also try watching bad performances as a way to internalize what not to do on stage. , This is the best way to gain a sense of what’s working when you’re on stage. For best results, film yourself rehearsing, and look for strengths and weaknesses. Does your style look natural, or are your movements forced? Are your sound and body language clear? Ideally, you should be able to smooth out the weak parts of your performances before even getting on stage. "
"
Determine the type of rehearsal you want to hold.,
Distribute the necessary materials before the rehearsal.,
Schedule the band rehearsal.,
Conduct the rehearsal according to the schedule.,
Make sure the band members know what to practice at home.",How to Lead a Band Rehearsal," Band rehearsals can be held for several reasons, most notably as ""jam sessions,"" in-depth practices, or dress rehearsals.


A jam session is a relatively unstructured type of rehearsal. Rather than trying to address imperfections in the music, the band will play through a lot of material - often material that is either familiar or improvised. Jam sessions allow the band members to develop their overall sound, get more comfortable playing with each other, and have fun.
An in-depth practice session is much more structured. This type of rehearsal involves spending lots of time on relatively little material - perhaps a single piece or even a few troublesome phrases within a piece. The goal is to fine-tune the music from both a technical and lyrical perspective.
A dress rehearsal is a session held shortly before a performance. These serve primarily to warm the band up and keep the music familiar in their heads. Dress rehearsals should not be used to introduce new pieces or changes.;
, Depending on the type of rehearsal being held, you may want to distribute some materials in advance. If an in-depth practice is scheduled, make sure the band members have copies of the musical score and an audio recording if possible. You should also consider distributing a copy of the rehearsal schedule detailing how the time will be spent.

, The overall meeting time should be known by all band members well in advance. Short rehearsals can leave little time for anything but warming up, while excessively long rehearsals can lead to fatigue and distraction. A good starting point is a 3-hour rehearsal with a short break every hour.


As the rehearsal leader, make sure you know how the time will be spent. Plan time for the band's warm-up, and know how much time you want to spend on each piece or section. You can make changes to this schedule as needed during the rehearsal.
Make sure to include time for band members to set up. Drum sets take time to set up, for instance. String instruments ideally need time to adjust to the temperature and humidity of the room in order to stay in tune. Consider opening the rehearsal space for an hour or so before the practice begins.

, Strive to begin practicing right on time with a group warm-up. Use the schedule as a guide, but make sure to attune yourself to the band's needs. Allocate extra time to sections that need work, while spending less time on better-sounding sections. If you are also acting as a lead performer, make sure to take control of each song's direction. The band should respond to cues from the lead performer, not the other way around.

, When the rehearsal is over, make sure all the band members know when the next rehearsal is and what the band's goals are for the time in between. Each player should have a good idea of what needs to be practiced at home and what to expect in the next group rehearsal.

"
Choose a stand-out outfit.,
Get out of your comfort zone.,
Exaggerate your movements.,
Take up space.,
Control your movements and posture.",How to Have a Good Stage Presence2," When an audience comes to a show, they’re not just looking to hear your songs, they’re looking for a full sensory experience. Coordinate outfits with your band members so that you’ll have a memorable look that makes you stand out from other bands.


Look at stars that have developed their own signature style. Missy Elliot is famous for wearing Adidas tracksuits, Michael Jackson his futuristic, red Thriller outfit, and Ke$ha known for her unique glitter patterns. Choose a signature item that will make you memorable within your own genre of music. Wear that pink hat you’ve always had your eye on, or finally buy yourself a brightly colored suit that nobody will be able to forget.
Don’t be afraid to accessorize! Wear jewelry, make-up, and anything else that adds charisma to the performance. For dancers, be sure to wear clothing that doesn’t inhibit movement.

, Looking the part also means acting the part on stage. Everybody has different strengths and weakness that need to be practiced, and it’s important to recognize what needs to be worked on. If you struggle with dancing and getting into the music physically, take a dance class. If you’re feeling shaky on hitting higher notes, sign up for a voice lesson. Enroll in an acting class with a teacher that you admire. Getting individualized attention will help you fine tune problematic aspects of your performance and allow your strengths to shine. , For the crowd to notice your moves, you have to make them big and dramatic. Don’t be afraid to exaggerate everything, from vocals and facial expression to jumping around and dancing. Do it big so that your audience notices that you’re into the performance.

, At any kind of show, the performer is faced with the task of maneuvering around a very large stage. It’s important to maximize the space you’re given. If you find yourself tending towards a particular side of the stage, be sure to move around and fill the space with your presence.


For musicians, don’t spend the whole show in front of the microphone. Sing into another band member’s mic or dance so that the audience is constantly watching to see what you’ll do next.
For actors, moving across the stage and executing lines can be tricky. Be sure to breath properly so that you don’t get winded. If you stay in one place, your performance might seem unbelievable and stunted.

, Even if you’re feeling nervous on stage, don’t let it show through your body language. Avoid twiddling your thumbs, pacing, or touching your face. All of these movements show that you’re not in control of your body. Whether you’re a musician, actor, or dancer, be aware of your body positioning in relation to the audience and observe how other experts in your field move on stage. Use good, natural posture and controlled, relaxed body movements. "
"
Be natural.,
Include the crowd.,
Allow yourself to become one with the crowd.,
Be active.,
Vary your vocals.",How to Have a Good Stage Presence3," The audience will notice if you are trying too hard or lack confidence. Relax, and be yourself on stage. For actors, it’s particularly important to be relaxed in your body movements and speech so that your performance will be believable. , Make the crowd feel like they’re part of the show. People don’t come to music shows just to listen. They want to move, dance, and sing along. Create an energetic environment that allows the crowd to let loose and have fun. The best way to do this is – have fun yourself!


For actors, make eye contact with the crowd. Eye contact is the closest you can get to making physical contact with your audience. Don’t choose one or two audience members to look at. This might make them feel nervous or singled out. Instead, practice scanning the crowd in a way that appears natural to engage each audience member. Remember to show as much emotion as you can through the eyes to make the performance convincing. To start the show off on the right foot, applaud your audience as you first walk onto the stage. Though it may sound strange to clap towards the audience, they’ll start clapping back and the room will be immediately buzzing with energy. Try holding the mic out and asking the crowd to sing along.

, For actors, this means making eye contact and commanding the audience’s attention with your presence through body movement and speech. For musicians, get involved with what the crowd is doing. If the crowd is dancing, jump off stage and dance with them!


If you’re playing a show with a mosh pit, go for a stage dive. Mosh pits generate huge amounts of energy at concerts, and showing your audience you want to be part of the fun will get them even more excited about your show.
If the energy is right, invite a few people from the front row on stage, or lean over to shake and slap hands.

, Even if you’ve perfected your music and dancing, go the extra mile and put all the energy you can muster into the performance. If you have any dramatic tricks, give them a shot, and include the rest of your band in your dramatics.

, The audience will grow bored by a constant monotone and aggravated by perpetual sing song. Utilize every vocal register (low, high) and vary your pitch and volume. Let your voice convey richness and emotionality to keep your audience engaged. "

, Assess yourselves honestly. Are you each really good at what you do? Could a band reshuffle be in the offing? Maybe one of you would be better on bass than on vocals or better on vocals than the drums? Try a few things out if there are any weak spots, including making changes to band members if really needed., Your band members may not always be the same people. People come and go, you may end up with new people all together. Just keep playing and, most importantly, spend time getting to know the strengths of new members and putting that to your band's best advantage.

, If you break up with her/him things might get fiery. Whether it's a relationship problem or something else, the band will be screwed because of it.

, Even if your band is starting out by mixing unique music with covers, you should have already developed a band brand that people can recognize. What are the things that make your band stand out from the rest? What makes your band unique and authentic?, Find something original and make it your trademark. Remember how you recognize KISS? For example, the female in your band could take on a schoolgirl look, whilst the singer takes on a glam rock look, etc. Make sure you’re remembered!

, For a young, unknown band, this agent could be a good, trustworthy friend. Pay him a small percentage of anything that he books for the band. A good booking agent will try to get you gigs, because they only get a percentage of whatever the band makes. Many clubs will only talk to booking agents, not band members. The booking agent that you hire, or the person that you put in charge of booking, should only do booking! Your manager should be a different person than your booking agent.

, Hand out flyers to get popular. Come up with your own symbol or saying. Have something that people will remember you by, before they even hear you play.

, The Internet is how most people find out about many unknown bands. Make your own thing on many popular sites for music. The more you give people the opportunity to listen to you, the better.






Film yourselves playing and stick it on YouTube. For extra effect, do something crazy, like film it in your underwear, or covered in chocolate. Link it in an email to your friends, and encourage them to send it on.







, Use your profile to comment on your favourite bands’ pages and tell them that they have inspired your band, e.g. “Keep the good music coming! Thanks for inspiring our band.” This is also a subtle way of advertising, as it encourages the band’s fans to check out your music.






Encourage people to add you through social media sites. This is a great way to get the word round.







, Playing live energizes people and wins you your initial fans, who can spread the word, upload photos onto Instagram and tell the world how amazing your band is.

, Sell these at your concerts, starting at a low price.






Offer free or very cheap downloads of your music direct from your website. Or offer a teaser for free and then ask that the album be purchased.

, Get a logo and print it on a t-shirt or hoodie for your friends and relatives to wear. Most importantly, have all band members wear the t-shirt, hoodie, etc. whenever they're out and about. Ask them to be ready to talk about the band wherever they go.

, Regardless of genre, look, or even what size crowd they draw. If a band is working hard, and can be trusted and maybe even be friends, you should play with them.

Think about how many times you have seen a flyer on a telephone pole or bulletin board. You notice them, because they stand out. So, create a simple but distinct looking flyer that states when you and your band will perform. You can put a flyer in your local café, for example. This is a great way to get noticed.Throw a link to your Twitter handle or Facebook profile on the flyer. This shows that you have a digital presence as well as a physical one.;
, This won’t be easy, but it is doable. To succeed at this, you should contact radio shows that play music in your particular genre. Send links to plenty of radio shows and internet radio shows as well. You might be surprised by the interest!


Send your songs to music podcasts online! There are people who create podcasts every week that cover new music. Use the internet to find these podcasts and send songs to the people who run them.
Find a local radio station and see if they want to hear your music. Perhaps your town has a university, see if they have a radio station. Student radio stations exist to play new music. You should see if they will even let you play a gig in the station!, Go to a talent show held at the community center. Play an acoustic set in the park. These are all great ways for people in your community to see and hear your band. For example, playing at a carnival in your community is a great way to get noticed. You can also see if you can play birthday parties or weddings.


If your town has a record store, you might try seeing if you can play a gig there. Go to a record store that you often frequent, and ask the manager if they have had bands play in-store. They will generally be excited to have your band play because you will be bringing people into their store. You will be targeting people who are interested in hearing new music. You might even be able to sell a few copies of your album there., You don’t have to be amazing to dj a party. See if there are any events in your area that need a DJ. Not only will you be able to play music you like, but you can mention that you play in a band as well. You will be able to expose people to new music, and you can even drop in a tune that your band made.

, Start sending out press releases to local music zines in your area. At first you might not get a lot of attention, but as time goes on you might find a journalist who wants to speak to you. See if any of your bandmates have friends or relatives who are journalists. When they agree to talk to you, be ready to tell them about any new projects that the band is working on. An interview will allow people to learn more about the band.


You don't need to directly ask a journalist to interview your band. You can simply ask a question like ""Are you doing any features on local bands?"" If they say yes, you can tell them that you are in a band. They might ask you to be in the feature!
Use this opportunity to promote your shows. You want people to know where and when you are going to be playing. Talk about your influences and music that you like. Someone who reads an interview and sees that you like a band that they like will definitely be interested in your music.
You should try to spread this interview in any way possible. Make sure that you get a link to it when it appears online. After you get that link, throw it on any social media page you have and your website.

, Send out demos to music journals, magazines, and blogs. You should do this no matter how confident you are about the work you have produced. Sure, taste is subjective, and it may seem frightening to have what you worked on judged by someone you have never met. However, even if your work is massively panned, then you still will have name recognition. There is also the chance that whoever gets your record will actually love it. You should try to contact people in your local scene first because they will be more likely to review your album.Send as much music as possible to online venues; blogs are a good place to start. There are hundreds of blogs dedicated to music out there. You should target blogs that focus on your genre of music., Try giving away an album on the internet. If people don’t have to pay for your tunes, then they are more likely to listen to them.Giving your music away allows people to test your band, before they commit to purchasing anything that you have to sell. Set up a Bandcamp page and list your album. You can set the price to zero. If you want to go the analog route, you can try burning forty CDs, decorating them, and laying them around places that people frequent.


You can also post your music on Youtube, Spotify, and SoundCloud.

, You, of course, need to decide which venue is best for promoting your band’s content. Facebook is often chosen because of its familiarity and ubiquity. In that case, you should make a page for your band. You can also use Instagram and Twitter as well. Try to get all your band-members to link to this page as much as possible. Maybe your band members have blogs, ask them to write about the band. You want to spread your band’s narrative as much as possible.You might want to go through the route of creating your own website.On the website, you can put your band’s biographical details, place of origin, and genre of music. It does not to need to be flashy, but it should tell people what your band is about.

, Record covers of popular songs that you enjoy. People enjoy new interpretations of their favorite songs. You should upload your covers online. Try putting them on Youtube or SoundCloud. When people search for these songs, they will also see your cover versions as well., You’ve probably heard plenty of songs that have been remixed. If you have a friend who knows how to do this, then allow them to remix one of your band’s songs. This is a great way to get more listeners because it shows that you are willing to experiment. You may find a new audience for your music by doing this. Once your song is remixed, ask that friend to post it online., You might know a few different bands that have been signed by small labels in your area. Getting signed to a small label is a great way of shifting the promotional burden, so to speak. A label will do promotional work for some bands on its roster and might incubate others. Independent labels are always on the lookout for interesting new sounds., You should be very careful about how you go about doing this. Make list of about fifteen labels. Order the list from most desired to least desired. After you do this, make sure that start researching your top five or six labels. Don't just bombard them with music. Follow their social media pages and talk to their representatives. You need to build a connection these labels before you start sending them music. Once you have built a connection, you should start sending your music out., This is not as impossible as this sounds. In fact, hundreds of labels have been started because their creators wanted to release their own music. If you create a specific plan of how you plan to do business, then you are already on your way. The next step is obtaining money. You and your band members should save up as much money as you can. After you do this, choose a cheap medium to release your music with. Cassette and compact disc are both relatively inexpensive formats. If you do a release like this, then you will have complete control over your music."

,
Tell everyone in the band to make a list of problems they would like to discuss and then at the next practice, have everyone sit in a circle and take turns bringing up their issues.

Make sure everyone knows that being in a band is about fun and should not let it ruin a friendship.

,
Remember that the band is a single entity and not just a group of people.,Write up a contract that is legal and binding containing all of the above

",How to Keep a Band Together," If the drummer likes hard rock and the lead guitarist is into death metal, you're bound to have problems sooner or later.;
, If one person alone makes the decisions and bosses others around, it'll end up in a mess. No one likes an all-out dictator breathing on their neck!

, This is the key to having a successful band. Make sure that every member, no matter how important or unimportant they are, can share their views with the rest of the group. One of the main reasons that people leave bands is because they feel that the rest of the band isn't listening to them.

, Whether it's that the bassist wants a longer solo or the keyboardist doesn't like the style of music you're playing, try all you can to work it out.

,, Go out for ""band nights out"", hang around after school, and get to know your the members of your band as real people.

Try having at least one acoustic and one electric guitar.
Decide if the singer will play an instrument or not.
Your band should be mostly comprised of friends and family. If you can't find someone, hold auditions for people at your school.

, It should be something that matches your band's style and the type of music you play.

, Make a Facebook, Twitter, Bebo, Tumblr, YouTube, Hi5, Sublime, Orkut, Trig, SoundCloud, Viddler, Flickr, Pinterest, Patch, EventWax, Google, Yahoo, etc.


Make a website using Weebly, Webs.com, or Virb, or you can make your own not using a pre-made site.
Some companies let you install an app, approved by Apple, that helps you put your music on iTunes. Some US companies are Catapult, CD Baby, INgrooves/Fontana, TuneCore, and The Orchard. You can go to to find the others.

, Make posters and hang them around town. Make a booth where you give out fliers to passerby.


Some stores let you hang your posters in their windows. Try grocery stores, they usually will.
When you give someone a flier, give them a small stack of little mini fliers (1"" by 3"") with the condensed information on it.
The fliers and mini fliers should say the name of the band, the members' names, your social networking accounts, and all the ways to contact you (phone, email, etc).

, Find shows that are accepting rising bands, or have your own show."
"
Decide your objective and final result!,
Think about the philosophy of your band.,
The name of your band should meet the following criteria to succeed:


It has to be short and simple to remember.,
Keep the music simple.,
Improve your sound.,
Gather your troops!,
Book gigs.,
Rehearse at least once a week!,
Visual symbolism.,
Form alliances with bands, labels, magazines and promoters.",How to Start a Metal Band That Will Stick," Here it's time to think what you want to achieve with your extreme metal band. It helps to be as specific as possible, like: ""In 2 years' time I want to play X shows outside my own country and I want to release 2 full albums."" Remember that the most mistake that people make is to listen other people who try to bring you down and tell you it can't be done! Screw them all. Just focus on your final outcome that you want to achieve with your band and don't listen to negative remarks from people. Focus on this only one day and write it all down.;
, Create something special that hasn't been done before. Being “most extreme” or “loudest/hardest” just doesn't do it anymore! Fans want something new and fresh. You are the one who has to fill this need by showing what your band can do. For example, instead of creating another heavy metal guitar shredder band, create a theme with original statement. A good example of this is the band Burning Fallus (who invented a new genre of music called: the working class rock). Remember this: you're not the only one who wants to climb on top of the mountain of fame. There are thousands of hungry ambitious rockers breathing down your neck trying to beat you to the punch. An original concept of your band creates an instant distinction that will immediately attract attention! Spend one week observing and learning what has been done and what has not been created. Remember don't listen to negative remarks from your parents, friends and people who think that your idea is stupid! It's not!

, No fancy historic names and superhero bull. Just a good concept to describe your band.
It has to be between 1 and 2 words long. This improves the memorability (think: W.A.S.P, Manowar, Nargaroth, Death, Macabre etc.). Long name is a no go! Scrap it, no matter how cool it sounds! Remember that short is sweet and people's attention span is littered by advertising, daily obligations, kids, wives etc. No one needs another “Blasphemous Night Slashin' Cunt Rider” to have to remember after a night of heavy drinking. Once again be original and always have a great story about the name of your band (you will need this for interviews later!).

, Complicated music sucks! Simple music always prevails! Watch the reactions of the crowds during a gig! The most amount of hard head banging occurs during simple rhythmic stages of any song. That means that no matter how good you play the guitar, bass, drums, keys or throat, your fans will remember how your music MAKES THEM FEEL! That's the whole secret. Keep your music simple, but variable. By now you probably know what genre you want to play. You have a good name and philosophy. Now couple it with original music that will support what you have to say! Remember this: always listen to your fans about the potential improvements in your music. Your fans will buy your CDs, shirts and other merch. Show them respect and they will answer you in 1000 fold. Take 3 weeks to experiment with the music and don't be afraid to scrap the riffs that you think are rubbish.

, The human brain reacts to sounds very differently indeed. What's important in a heavy genre of music is the amount of “balls”. You can create “balls” by using:


All tube guitar amps with decent speakers.
Natural sounding drums. Avoid digital square sound as much as you can!
If you have keyboards, keep the keyboard player on a tight leash and don't let him play any serenades!
Put some effects on the vocals and use decent mics (like Sennheiser, Shure, Oktava or Röde).
Natural pumping bass tones. Your bass player has to lift up your sound and blow the fans away with the sheer amount of feel, not volume. Best sound is the one that can send shivers down your spine.

, Creating a band means putting in some effort. Next to playing skills, your band members have to have the following abilities:


Languages (at least 3)
Communication skills (for promotional purposes)
Programming and internet skills (for indie promotion and gigs booking)
Lack of addictions. No hard core junks or alcoholics. They will ruin your band in a snap. Occasional drinking and cigarettes/joints are no problem as long as it does not cause harm to the band.
Organizational talent, for fast and easy transportation, setup and recording
Sound and Graphic skills (for your artwork and finishing touches on your album).


The more diverse your band member's skills, the better you will be at creating a true unique band. In time you will have external help for small things like selling merch or setting up your equipment before the show, but for now assemble your team wisely! Hold auditions and ask for dedication before you accept any new members to your band. Your skills in psychology will be very valuable.







, This task should be delegated to only one person. Use Google calendar to make sure that everyone updates the dates that someone cannot play a show. This way you avoid any nasty surprises and cancellations. Remember, no matter where you live, always try to book shows outside your own country. Metal is about connections! Use them and don't sit on your ass hoping for fain of fame.

, This is probably the most crucial ritual that will keep your band thriving and that will keep your band members motivated! It's important to play new stuff and write new lyrics at any attempt you have the time. Set a fixed day in the week for rehearsals. This way everyone is obligated to come. If you don't rehearse, you don't succeed!

, Create a spectacle for the fans to admire. Flags, logo's lights, uniforms, strippers, etc. Whatever it takes, DO IT! The fans want to know that you have a “brand” of your band that they can wear with pride and defend in a fierce argument with a fellow metal head! Visual symbols keep your image fresh and alive.

, Metal is about the people who keep it alive! The more support you show to the fellow metal heads and fans, the more respect you will get. You must communicate and tell everyone about your band. This is the only way to become successful. Forget the “DIY” mentality and start forming alliances as soon as you can. Always have promo CDs and materials like stickers or other stuff you can hand out as advertisement. In the beginning this will be hard, however after you pass the first threshold, you will be more famous and respected in the metal community. Good luck and don't give up! HELL YEAH!"

Decide the type of band you want to be in.,
Hire the members who will play for your band.,
Choose some songs to start having band rehearsals.,
Agree on your material.",How to Start a Girl Band and Get It Produced1," Music is made up of a multitude of genres. Rock, blues, hip hop, pop, and country are just touching the surface of what those genres are. Figure out which sound best defines the band you hope to be in.Ask yourself what genres you enjoy playing the most and who you hope your target audience will be. Will your audience rock out while doing mosh pits? Will your audience be mellow and sway to your songs as you play in tiny coffee shops?
Decide on the instruments you will have to use. A good start: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, and drums. You may want a keyboardist, sax, or brass, depending on what sort of music you'll be wanting to play.
How many people will it take for your vision of your band to come to life? Allow the sound you’re hoping to create act as your guide.;
, There are ways to get into contact with the right people even if you are unfamiliar with your local music scene. You can begin auditions as soon as you find people you think could fit the bill.Go to school talent shows or open mic nights to get into contact with local artists in their environment. This will help you get a taste of what they have to offer musically by listening to some of their original stuff.
A quicker, more technologically-savvy alternative is posting an ad on Facebook, Twitter, or even Instagram. Say something simple like: “Musician looking for an all female band to play with professionally. DM me for more details.”

, It's not important to do your own material at first. Start playing together and find out if you have good chemistry as a band. Plan on a time when all members can attend rehearsals.


Plan to have rehearsals at least one time per week. If you can squeeze out one or two more times, that would be perfect.
It might sound counterproductive to start with covers, or playing other people’s material, but it’s a great way to see what you gravitate towards collectively and as a group. This will help give you a direction of the kind of music you hope to be doing moving forward as a band.

, Encourage everyone who wants to write to write songs instead of delegating that task to one person. Over time, you will begin to agree who should do the biggest part of your band’s songwriting.


Keep your ego in check always. Nobody wants to be your backup band - if it's an ensemble, let it remain a collaborative effort.
When you first start creating, think of your message and the things you’re trying to say when you put your music out there to the world.Use guitar tab websites and other tutorials to help you push yourself musically with instruments and get better ideas of how to put music together as you arrange and develop your lyrics. Constantly push yourself.

You don’t want to be the weak link in your own jazz ensemble! It’s okay if you need a few lessons to brush up on your instrument -- do whatever it takes to feel completely confident.


In particular, make sure that you’ve mastered as many jazz standards as possible. Songs such as “Round Midnight,” “Sweet Georgia Brown,” “Body and Soul,” “Ain’t Misbehavin’,” and your personal favorites are a good place to start.;
, Depending on the style of jazz that you play, your ensemble can feature any number of musicians. Duos, trios, and quartets are all common, but quintets and larger groups can allow for a richer, more versatile sound. Try to figure out how many people -- or instruments -- you would like your band to have, so you can start to plan.It’s not necessary to come up with a specific number for your band, but it helps to know whether you’re putting together a small group of two or three, or a larger band when it comes time for auditions.

, While most people have a pretty clear idea what jazz sounds, there are actually a variety styles within the genre. Your band doesn’t have to specialize in a single style, but it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the various styles and settle on your favorites. That way, you can find the right members for your band.Ragtime has a bold, passionate sound that borrows rhythms from traditional African dance.
The blues usually incorporates vocals into the songs, as well as guitars, piano, and harmonica.
Big band typically features ensembles of 10 or more players, featuring instruments such as trumpets, saxophones, piano, guitars, drums, and bass.
Dixieland jazz is also known as traditional or New Orleans jazz, and incorporates elements of ragtime and the Blues.
Bebop is similar to big band jazz, but it usually features smaller bands, consisting of four to six musicians.
Other styles that you might consider include folk jazz, free jazz, hot jazz, cool, and hard bop.

, A jazz band’s rhythm section is crucial because it provides the foundation for all of the music. Drums and other percussion instruments are usually a key component of a rhythm section, but you can also include the piano, bass, and guitar. Determine which of these instruments you’d like to include in your ensemble. , When many people think of jazz, they think of the impressive sound of horn instruments wailing away. This usually means brass such as trumpets and trombones, but the horn section can also feature woodwinds, including saxophones and clarinets. Figure out which of these instruments that you’d like your band to include, so you know what type of musicians to look for.If you’re planning a smaller band, it’s a good idea to have at least one of each horn type instead of doubling up on any. For example, if you’re fronting the band and play the trumpet, consider adding trombone, sax, and clarinet players to the ensemble, not another trumpet player.
In a traditional big band, there are usually five trumpets, five trombones, and five saxophones, with a clarinet sometimes substituting for one of the saxophones.

, While the rhythm and horn sections are essential to a jazz band, you can fill out your sound further by incorporating other instruments. Some jazz ensembles include a flute, while others feature a tuba. You might swap out a guitar in the rhythm section with a banjo, or work in a harmonica for some songs. Remember the combination of instruments that you like best in your favorite jazz bands if you need inspiration.You may want to include a vocalist for your jazz band as well. It helps to find a musician who can play one of the other instruments in addition to singing, though, so you don’t have to commit to vocals on every song.

, The size of your rehearsal space may affect how many members your band can have. If you’re rehearsing in your garage, for example, you may not have enough room for a big band ensemble. In addition, you should also the venues where you hope to plan, such as local jazz clubs. A small stage may mean that you’re better off keeping the band to a trio or quartet.

, Finding band members among people who you already know well is usually the best place to start because you’ll already know if you share the same taste in jazz. Discuss your plans with the musicians that you know, and see if any of them are a good fit for your ensemble.Make sure that the family and friends who you ask to join fit your vision of the band. For example, if you’re a trumpet player and you’re starting a trio or quartet, don’t ask your cousin who also plays the trumpet to join because the sound may wind up unbalanced.

, If you’ve been a fan of local jazz bands that have disbanded, you may have a shortlist of potential musicians for your new band. Get in touch with the members, and see if they’re interested in joining your ensemble.


If you don’t have any friends or acquaintances in common with the musicians who you’re interested in, check to see if they have any social media contacts. You may be able to contact them that way.

, You probably don’t have family and friends who play all of the instruments that you need for your band, especially if you’re starting a large jazz ensemble. If that’s the case, you’ll need to recruit other musicians to fill the other roles. Placing an ad is usually the easiest way to find interested parties. You can advertise online in music forums or Craigslist, or put an ad in a local paper.If you’re in school, consider creating a flier asking for jazz band members that you can post on student bulletin boards.

, Whether you know the musicians you’re considering for your band or not, you want to be sure that they can play well enough to be part of your jazz ensemble. You can also make sure that prospective members know what will be expected of them if they join and the type of music that they’ll be playing.When you’re holding auditions, you can either ask all prospective members to prepare a specific jazz piece that you’ve chosen or allow them to play any jazz song that they prefer.
Don’t just consider the musicians’ skills when they’re auditioning. Take their personality into account as well, so you can ensure that they’re a good fit for your band.

, When you first start your band, it’s best not to have formal practices because you don’t really know how all of the members fit together yet. Instead, hold an informal jam session, so you can get to know one another’s playing styles. It also allows you to discuss the creative direction for the band -- while you may be the founding member, it’s important to allow everyone to have a say in developing the band’s sound.At your jam session, you might not even play any specific songs. Allow the members to play their favorite riffs, and see how they all fit together.
You can also have band members all choose their favorite songs, and play them without worrying too much about being perfect.

, Once the band is a little more comfortable playing with one another, it’s time to come up with a set list. When you’re just beginning, don’t try to come up with original material. Instead, try to choose four or five classic jazz songs, such as “In the Mood” or “Take Five,” that everyone in the band likes to do covers of., After you’ve come up with a set list for your band, the only thing left to do is rehearse the songs. To ensure that you’re all committed to improving, though, it’s important to create a schedule that everyone in the group can stick to, so you can play the songs regularly.For the best results, aim to rehearse together once or twice a week for three to four hours each time.
Make sure that everyone in the band practices on their own too. You should practice your own parts for each song everyday to ensure that you have it down.
It’s a good idea to record your rehearsals. That way, you can go back and listen to your performance to see what parts of each song need to be worked on.
Everyone in the band should agree to rules for rehearsal, such as everyone coming prepared and showing up on time. Post a list of them in your rehearsal space, so no one forgets what is expected of them.

, These days, people get so much of their information online, so it’s important to market your band on the internet. Establish social media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as on music-specific sites, including Bandcamp, Spotify, and Soundcloud. The goal is to spread the band’s name, and connect with fans, who may eventually help promote you.In the beginning, you may not have gigs to promote online. Instead, share photos of the band, sneak peeks of songs that you’re working on, and other behind-the-scenes information.
Try to come up with social media content that will help you engage your audience. For example, you might post a poll that asks for people’s favorite jazz songs.
While the band doesn’t necessarily need its own webpage at the start, it’s a good goal to have in mind. In the meantime, your Facebook page can serve as a way for people interested in booking you for potential gigs to get in touch.
Once you’ve started to build up a following online, you might want to start an email mailing list, so you can contact your fans directly.

, You want to give the people who might book you for a gig an idea of what the band actually sounds like, so posting a few videos on YouTube is an ideal way to showcase your talent. If you don’t have video of any official gigs, share some of your rehearsals.When you’re posting videos to YouTube, it’s best to post covers of well-known jazz songs. That will help ensure that your band’s videos will turn up in more searches and help you attract a bigger audience.

, If you’re just starting out, it’s probably going to be difficult to find gigs at first. However, you can gain experience performing live with the band and potentially attract the attention of venue promoters and managers if you play at open mic nights, which are typically open to everyone., The best way to pursue potential gigs is to go directly to the source. Make a list of all the venues in your area where jazz bands typically play, and contact the booking agent or venue manager to see if there are any opportunities to perform.It’s best to either speak to the venue on the phone or visit in them in person. Don’t send an anonymous email.
Make sure that you have your online presence in place before you contact venues, so you can direct the manager or booking agent to videos and other content that will help them get a feel for the band.

, If you’re interested in playing at special events, such as weddings and birthday parties, it’s a good idea to get in touch with special event businesses, such as party planners, venue management, caterers, and florists. That’s because people who are hosting events may ask them for recommendations. It’s much easier if you have fliers that they can pass on.


Your fliers should include a photo or logo for the band and all of your contact info. Make sure to direct potential clients to your YouTube videos or Facebook page too, so they can see you in action.

Find a name for your group that will be remembered.,
Agree on the band’s style.,
Be as authentic to your voice and persona as possible.",How to Start a Girl Band and Get It Produced2," Let your girl band’s name come to you as organically as possible. The less thought and attempt at cleverness, the better. Create the music and allow the name to come to you., Appearance is also an important part of the girl band package. Create a visual match that is complementary to the sound of the band.You and the other ladies don’t have to wear the exact same thing, but dressing in a similar style might take less focus away from the band itself. One person standing out more than the rest of the band could pull focus away from what people really should pay attention to: the sound.
All-black ensembles are a great way to look uniform without dressing exactly alike. Another way to do that is to come up with a theme that dictates what the group wears: goth, vintage, girly, or punk.

, Your image should be an extension of your music. Think of the image of the band as the invitation and your music as the actual party.Don’t make your image an inauthentic version of yourself. If your band has an Ingrid Michaelson aesthetic where you all wear glasses in understated clothing as you play an intimate coffee shop, be authentic and allow your image to reflect that. Don’t feel the need to be scantily clad if sex isn’t something you’re trying to sell.
Your image will be what fans will see in promo shots of the band, flyers, and your band’s logo. Keep this in mind and try to be consistent in your brand awareness.

Nothing tightens up your sound like playing live and practicing in your garage forever is not an option if you want to get signed and produced.

, Letting people you know hear your music. Ask them to tell their friends about your band. Word of mouth is a great way to gain more free exposure.

, Create a hub for your band on different social media sites. Make official pages for your band on sites like Facebook, Soundcloud, Twitter, and even Instagram.

Invest money into creating and producing a demo for your band.,
Send out promo packages to labels.,
Start shopping around for a manager.",How to Start a Girl Band and Get It Produced4," Don’t feel intimidated by the reality of creating a demo. It’s possible to create demos in DIY sound booths if you have the right padding to line your walls, the right mic, and the right audio equipment.


Another option for creating your demo is to pay for studio time. Some places offer low rates like $35 an hour to use their equipment. Consider that when looking for a place to record.
Sell your finished demo at your shows for profit, place them online on places like Soundcloud and YouTube for exposure, and/or distribute them to labels., Nowadays, sending tracks to labels is as simple as finding the right email and sending over audio files. Send your promo package in a professional way by giving the audio file a sensible name, branding it with your band’s logo, and any additional marketing materials that your band may have.Make sure that the track is easily shareable in the event that a producer or exec likes it and wants to share it.
When you’re sending a demo to labels, make sure that the CD or package you include has 2-3 of your band’s best songs on it.Amongst your marketing materials, there should also be a press release enclosed. Including a press release with the promo package you send to renowned music sites will help them publish a write up about your band more efficiently.

, A manager can rep your band and make the phone calls and reach out to people if necessary. It might be possible to obtain a manager who won’t require a payday until they bring you results.

Take whatever you can get at first.,
Deliver your demo to venue owners personally.,
Network with people.,
Create an electronic press kit.,
Make your own venue.",How to Get Your Band Noticed1," Although most people know that the best spot for a gig at a bar or club is Friday or Saturday night, taking any day or time slot available is a great way to start playing live. Bar and club owners want to know what kind of crowd you’ll be able to pull before giving you the headlining spot.The bar owner is only concerned with sales, so if you can fill his bar on a Tuesday night, he will be sure to ask you back.
When you get a time slot, make sure you tell all of your friends and family to come and bring their friends so you pack the place out.;
, When there are multiple bands fighting for a spot, having a personal interaction with the owner might just give you the edge over anyone else. Deliver demos to any venue you want your band to perform at.Research to find out who the owners are and how to contact them. Then, ask for five minutes of their time to personally deliver your band’s demo.
When you meet with them, give them a quick overview of your band and let them know you’d be happy to take any available openings. Be professional and genuinely nice when you talk to them.

, You need to be networking all the time to land a gig. Work your music into every conversation; you never know who may be able to give you a lead.


Carry demo CDs at all times to be able to give them to anyone you think might be able to get you a gig.
Contact other bands in your area who are already playing gigs. Ask them how they landed their first gig and see if you can use their resources. See if you can open for them one night.
Go to other bands' gigs, especially the bigger ones. Most likely there will be talent agents, industry people from labels, radio stations, and other booking agents there for you to give your demo to.

, Make a digital file of information about band members, song reviews, and samples. Share the file with your social media accounts for people to download. Compile all of your band’s info into a presentation file such as a PowerPoint.
Email your electronic press kit to bar and venue owners.

, If you've tried a few tactics and still can't seem to book a gig, it might be time to set up your own. Many bands just starting out must play for free and to a small audience.


Play in a public place like a park. Set up your band and let passersby take notice. Engage with the crowd in a friendly way, and you may get some new fans. Just keep in mind that many areas require that you register for a permit to do this.You should also pay close attention to your city's noise ordinance laws and go acoustic if necessary.
You can also start an underground venue. If your band plays music belonging to a less mainstream genre, like noise and many types of punk, it can be especially difficult to book gigs until you build up a sizable local following. Many artists go the DIY route, renting out practice spaces for performances. While a common feature of underground scenes, these venues are often illegal. Know your local laws and keep your venue a safe place for your guests. Stay away from residential areas where you're more likely to get shutdown by noise complaints."

Get a website.,
Promote yourself online.,
Give away promotional material.,
Use flyers.,
Send your demo to radio stations.,
Get help from established bands.",How to Get Your Band Noticed2," It’s important in this digital age to have a website for your band where record producers and fans can learn more about you and hear clips of your music.If possible, use your band's name as the url for your website. For example, if your band's name is Funky Blue Cats, you should make your website www.funkybluecats.com.
It’s a good idea to have your music for sale on your website. You can sell mp3 downloads or CDs to ship to fans.
If your band's name is already being used as a website, consider changing your name so you can get the url with your band's name.
Put your website on all promotional material to drive traffic to your site. The more unique visitors you get to your website, the higher up on search engines your site will be.

, In addition to a website, you should use social media and other websites to promote your band. This will give you an outlet to actively promote your band online and get information about your gigs out there.Your band should use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandnation, Reverb, Spotify, and any other site where you can get your name and music out.
Film recordings of songs or practice sessions to give people a taste of your music and the vibe of your band. People will be more likely to listen to the music online if they have something to watch, too.
Consider doing a cover song and uploading it onto a well known site like YouTube to get lots of views. This will get your band's name out and then drive people to your other videos of original music.
Keep a newsletter for your band. Post your newsletter on your website and then link to it on all of your social media accounts. The newsletter should talk about what your band is up to and give insight into every step of your career to create a long lasting relationship with the fans.

, A great way to get your band's name out there is to get people using and wearing items with your information on it. You should be using your own promo material as much as possible as well.Have t-shirts made with your band's name, logo, album art, website, or other contact information on it, and give the shirts to friends, family, and fans to wear.
Give away promo material at all of your gigs. Stickers, pens, artwork such as small prints of your album cover, or magnets are great examples of items to hand out.

, Don’t underestimate the old promotional technique of putting up flyers all over town. When you have a gig coming up, create a flyer telling everyone when and where your band will be performing. Put the flyers up all over the town you’ll be performing in.Make sure you get permission to put the flyers up before you do so, otherwise they may be taken down.
Ask stores to let you put flyers up in their windows or on their door.
Put flyers in restroom stall doors. People will be forced to look at your flyer while they’re in there.
Think of your fanbase and put flyers up in places you think they'll visit frequently.
Ask your fans for help with distributing the flyers. Upload the file of the flyer to your website for fans to download and print out.

, College radio or small market local stations are the best bet for trying to break into getting play time. Send a demo and follow up with the station by asking them if they will play your music on the air.

, Successful bands obviously know how to get noticed, and they may have great advice for your group. By associating your band with a more popular one, the exposure may gain you some fans and make industry professionals take notice.


See bands similar to yours play on a regular basis. Especially when your band is just starting out, local bands with big followings can be a major asset. While there, strike up a conversation with your fellow musicians between sets. If you hit it off, mention your band and give them your contact info.
Ask to open for bigger acts. Once you get to know other bands in your local scene, you can start asking to open for them. This tactic is great for when you're having trouble booking your own gigs.Opening for major touring artists usually comes down to local contacts. Before you open for a major band, you'll have to establish a solid local reputation and a respectable fanbase. Once that happens, start hitting up local industry contacts to find out who is putting together a show you're interested in opening for and simply ask to do so. Depending on circumstances, you can even try contacting the band directly. As you become better established, booking agents will likely begin to approach you with opportunities to open."

Perform at events attended by label scouts.",How to Get Your Band Noticed3," Make sure that when you are contacting a record label you are sending them the absolute best quality you can produce. Record executives listen to hundreds of new artists each week. In order to get noticed, your demo must be flawless and able to stand out in a crowd.Record your demo with quality equipment. While music executives don't expect flawless sound quality and mixing from an unsigned band, you want your talent to show through. If you don't know someone with a home recording studio, try to rent out an affordable professional space. If you're a college student, your school's radio station can also be a great resource.
Focus on original work, not cover songs. Too many bands play cover songs because that's what bar patrons want to hear. You need your demo to show your creativity and songwriting ability. Boring covers will do neither.
If you do decide to include a cover song, make sure it's innovative and memorable. Adapt it to a radically different genre and/or play with the lyrics.
Get outside feedback before contacting a label. It's often difficult to evaluate your work realistically. Friends and family are also poor judges. Try playing your demo for acquaintances and lower level industry professionals and ask their honest opinions.

, Reach out to recently-signed recording artists for insight into who to contact at the label. Having a contact with someone already involved at the label will increase your chances of being noticed.Unless your contact is particularly close to both you and the artist, this tactic will probably only work if your music is in a similar genre.
Invite the artist to your shows. If the artist is local, don't be afraid to send him or her an invitation. Remember that the artist probably got into the industry over a love of music and will appreciate the work of other entertainers.
Send artists your press kit and ask for feedback on your music. If they respond, they are more likely to give you helpful, honest feedback than most other sources.
Ask for tips on how they were able to get signed. Even with the Internet, there is plenty of insider information not freely available to the average person. Additionally, a lot of common advice is out of date. A recently-signed artist can provide the most accurate and reliable information out there.

, Many big labels are bombarded with hundreds of demo tapes daily. If you want yours to stand out, send it with a gift or in an unusual way.


Tweet a link to your demo to the record company and ask fans to share the tweet.
Include a small piece of art or sculpture related to your band in some way.

, It may be easier to let the record label come to you by performing at shows like a battle of the bands. Talent scouts will often attend events where they can see lots of bands in one show.Play at large festivals and conferences. Some events require a solid application, while others are invitation only. Regardless, it's a good idea to put together a professional press kit that includes videos of live shows. Pay special attention to industry-focused events, as these are where there will be a high concentration of record executives.

Get your band mates together.,
Practice a lot.,
Create your first song.,
Prepare your first album.,
Plan gigs.,
Play said gig.,
Continue in the same way.,
Hit success.,
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the fame.",How to Start a Band when You're in School," It is recommended that you use at least two of your friends. Choose people you know and trust.;
, Before writing your own songs, try performing songs by other bands. If you can do it, you're ready to make your own.


Learn and feel comfortable with the basics of your instruments.
Start by covering songs. Have a band manager (someone in the band, normally the most responsible person) who plans practices.
If someone doesn't learn the instrument well enough, they have to leave. It's hard but necessary.

, Normally your lead singer will write the songs because they are the ones singing and know how it would sound. It could be something funny, happy, sad or imaginative; whatever takes your group's fancy.

, You successfully wrote your first songs. You need about maybe 5-10 songs, then you have to decide on your album name. Record it on a cassette or CD. Then give it out to people around school.

, Your band wants to get a gig at the school. Ask the principal or dean if you can plan a show in the cafeteria or gym. If they say yes, start preparing and pass out flyers or make posters to advertise the event.


Have your band manager find someone to let you play a gig somewhere where lots of people go. While it can seem hard, this is good management and communication skill building for this person.

, It's the big night, your crowd is excited, you're ready to make history in your school. Don't be nervous; if you practice enough, you'll be fine.


Before you play: it always helps for the singer to take a sip of water to get his/her vocals flowing. And don't practice much on the day of the gig, you don't want to be worn out when it's time for the real deal.
Pass out merchandise. Make CDs of the songs you've covered, and pass them out at your gig. Band t-shirts would be good too.

, For band life afterwards, keep practicing, keep planning gigs. Play a few more gigs. Get a relatively large fan base. A feature in the local newspaper is a really good thing to happen.


Make a kit of your music and stuff, and send your demo to record labels. This is how some school bands manage to get signed.

, If you do, remember that you're still in school, right? Be prepared. After getting a label, you will be playing concerts everywhere. People at school are going to be fawning over you. Don't give out your phone number unless you are really good friends with the person. Be careful if anyone asks you to be their girlfriend/boyfriend, because if they didn't know you before, they probably just want you for the fame.

, For like 10 minutes. You will still have to work, and although it may be fun, keep putting effort into it, and you'll need to start writing songs now. But, if you keep working at both school and the band, you are well on your way to success.

Have lots of rehearsals together, get a feel for the sort of music you want to play, who your target audience is, your shared interests, your plans, and other important considerations.


Essentially, you are making a product. And you are trying to sell this product to listeners. In order for this product to be successful, it has to be aimed at the right people and you have to be 200% enthusiastic and passionate about your band's identity.;
, One-word names have the advantage of being short, punchy, and easy to remember. Some of the greatest bands of all time have one-word band names that can be iconic and easily translated into a sweet logo:


Blur, Sleep, Kyuss, Genesis, and Death are all awesome single-word band names to take inspiration from. Just start flipping through the dictionary to look for cool words.
Give it a ""the"" in front if you want to seem old-school, or like a punky unit, and check out foreign words. Legendary metal band Pantera got their name from the Spanish word pantera which means ""panther.""
. If you want, add an adjective to your one-noun name, just like Arctic Monkeys, Black Mountain, and Crystal Castles did.

, Portishead, Lindisfarne, Sleater-Kinney, Boston, and Beirut are all named after specific geographical locations that meant something to the bandmates involved. Think about the streets you grew up on, or the name of the place where your band practices. Keep it local.

, Kennings are single words made out of two different words, and are techniques common to poetry and band names. Radiohead, Whitesnake, and Megadeth are all examples of band names made of two words smooshed together to make a new one.

, Animals always make popular choices for band names. Scorpion, the Eels, Gorillaz, and Grizzly Gear are classics of the genre. Start thinking of strange animals that haven't been the inspiration for a band yet. Yellow Squid? Box Turtles? Sun Bears? Think of your spirit animal and decide.

, Every sweet, awesome, short band name has probably already been taken by some crappy jam band in Canada. Go with a long name like We Were Promised Jetpacks or ..And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead and make sure it'll be safe. Even if it sounds slightly silly,

, One good way of finding a band name is to pick up an old epic poem and start flipping through to random poetic phrases that you might be able to swipe for a literary reference in your band name. A Rose for Emily and As I Lay Dying are both named after Faulkner stories.


Check out old English poets like John Milton, John Donne, or Wordsworth. There, you may find phrases like ""Disintegrated Angels"" which might make for great band names.

, The Band went through a whole host of names, including the Hawks, The Crackers, and The Hokeys before settling on ""The Band,"" which is just what everybody called them in the first place. Don't try to move mountains, just try for a simple approach if it's right in front of you.

, Sometimes, you can just change a small little things in a phrase to make it sound great. The Eagles is already a famous band, but what about Eagledeath, Black Eagle, Desert Eagle, Barbwire Eagle, or Eagle Meat? How do you think the Eagles of Death Metal got their name?


Bad english ensures it won't have been taken before. Ditto the umlaut. Def Leppard, Led Zeppelin, Mötley Crüe, and Blue Öyster Cült are all examples. But be careful about misspellings. Sometimes it works and other times looks like you're in a hair metal band.

, There are a number of website that generate potential band names. Type the phrase ""generate band names"" into your favorite search engine to find them. But beware, the names they come up with can be losers.

, However, a name may come to you all that you originally pass off as stupid or obscure, but if you keep coming back to it (all of you) then go with your hearts. There's a reason you keep coming back to it. And at the end of the day it is still your band. As long as you totally know why you've chosen the name and you can all relate to it, then you know you will never having a problem selling it as a product. And it will be something you will be proud of in 10 years time at school reunions or family occasions etc.

, If you are a metal band, and indie-rock type of name doesn't fit the bill. You want someone who has never heard your band before to know exactly what you'll sound like, just from your name. Acid Meltdown might be a great band name, but it's probably better for a psych-rock band than a black metal outfit.

, After you've settled on a couple of names you think you like, start shopping them around to friends. Ask if they think Roller Derby Crash sounds like a good name for your new pop-punk outfit. Listen to their feedback and see what they have to say.


Ask friends who are already in a band ask them how they got their band name. Also when you decide on your band name consult family and friends to see if they think it sounds cool, catchy and appropriate for the genre you play.

, Maybe you're not crazy about naming your band Asterisk Wonderland, but all your bandmates are crazy about it. You might be willing to go along with it now, but it could become a problem down the road if you're not happy. It's important to address any issues when they come up, so you don't end up resenting your band.


If you're embarrassed about saying your name to anyone at all, then it's not the right name. This might exclude names with swear words in, names that insult any particular person or party, and anything sexually explicit.

, One of the tough things about picking a band name is that there have been lots of great ones picked already, and it can be tough to find a good one. The Warlocks? Sorry, try again. The Black Plague? Too late. Doberman? Taken. Fortunately, there's a simple and free database of band names that you can register with first, to make sure nobody else takes it. Go to http://www.bandname.com and look up your favorites.

, A lot of bands like to use some sort of formula to come up with a name. Each member thinks of a random word or maybe you try to force a phrase that ties you altogether. But it won't feel right. Remember, you are stuck with this band name for the rest of your musical career. Make it a good one that fits.


Give it some time. There should be no rush in finding a band name that works for you. If you can't make it work, just pick one of your last names and call it a day. But don't rush into a name that you'll regret being known by in the future.
It is possible to change your name if you realize it isn't working but this is lost time and often damages your reputation. Finding the right name is obviously such a vital part of your band's identity so deserves the time and natural process it takes to develop.

Learn how to play your instruments.,
Find like minded musicians.,
Get a Garage.,
Have instruments.,
Buy gear.,
Name the band: Choose wisely.,
Immerse yourself in rock knowledge.",How to Start a Garage Band," This is the first and foremost thing you need to do. Once you feel you have the confidence to move forward, then you move to the next step.

, This is most important if you want to have a chance to form a garage band that will stay together. Life expectancy of a garage band is 1 year. Many garage bands stay together for decades. This is because they all think the same way and as a band and a not individuals. Always think what is best for the band.

, One cannot have a garage band without one. If you have a garage, empty the cars out of it. If the cars are already out of it, empty out sporting equipment, and ten foot wide paintings. A basement might work as well, however it creates problems for the drummer and when lugging a 25 pound amplifier down 70-year old wooden steps. Besides, garages are so much cooler. Having rugs lying around will help reduce the bass vibrations going all over the place. Make sure there is electricity and some dim lighting for setting a depressing non-conformist mood.

, The most important part of creating a rock band. You need instruments to play, and although not always mandatory, you will greatly benefit by knowing how to play it, as explained in detail in step three. Necessary instruments are a drum set, Electric Guitar, and Bass. You may elaborate, adding another guitar, keyboard, organist, or solo singer. individual background singers are strongly unadvised, due to the high level of un-garageness. Although cheap instruments might look unattractive in the store, they're a bargain for your buck and add to the ""grunge"" appeal of your garage band. Stay away from fancy and ""professional"" equipment, as they also have a high level of un-garageness. For instance, buying a real Fender Strat could cost you up to $1200, what kind of Garage rocker would you be if you had that kind of money I ask you? Instead, go to a pawn shop and buy a $50 Strat rip-off missing a fret or two, and put some stickers on it.

, The same rule basically applies to gear (amps, mics, pedals, etc.) as to instruments. Do not worry about getting cheaper gear, as long as it works and plays a decent sound. However, do not get too small an amp. You want something at least maybe 10""x10"", as smaller amps subtract from the garage band feel, and are suited more for country-rock playing in the subway.

, The name of your band might decide the fate of you. The name for your band may come in a variety of ways. It never hurt to have a cool name, it may be totally instantaneous, or you may lock yourself in a room for a week, using that as a source of inspiration. Whatever you do, make it sound unusual and unprecedented, try to think of something that would never happen like The Flying Hippos or something like ""Sex Pistols"" or ""Nine Inch Nails"" or ""Slipknot"". When choosing a name, it's wise to have something that either is so out there that people automatically want to listen, or maybe something ironic or vulgar, to attract attention in other ways

, Showing off your rock knowledge skills to everyone might increase your garage band stature. However, there are things to say and things not to say. Do not say, ""Did you know that Jimi Hendrix was born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942?"" Do say, ""Did you know Jimi Hendrix died by choking on his vomit?"" Instead of ""Did you know that Ozzy had two #1 Albums with Black Sabbath,"" you could say, ""When he was solo, he toured with Motley Crue, and one time on this bus, Vince Neal snorted an ant, and then to prove that he was more hardcore, Ozzy pissed on himself and licked it off"".

Find the right practice area.,
Rock out!",How to Start a Band in Middle School," The best number of members to have in your band is around three to five. The least you can have is 2. You will need (at least) a guitarist, singer, bassist and a drummer. If you can't find a drummer, check your school's band. They might have someone who can play a drum set.;
, Band names are one of the most important parts of the band. It has to entice people when they hear it so they will come to your shows. Think of things you like to do like skateboard or play computer games. Then add feeling words like pain, agony, or happiness. Something like ""Computing Joy,"" or ""Agonized Boarding"" are good examples, but this isn't the only method. If you can't find a good name then find something that is a favorite of every member of the band, then mix up the words, such as adding blue and green. 'Breen', then add another word. If you did mix two or more words together like 'Breen', try having the next word begin with the same letter. In this case, it's 'B', so maybe your end product would be 'The Breen Band'. Some band names may just be interesting.Try to be as creative as possible.

, You can try to get help from your parents, or from local instrument stores or clubs which are willing to support you.

, Start by covering your favorite songs by your favorite bands, so you will get used to playing together. Don't worry that your instruments don't match up with what you usually see. The piano can also provide both the bass and guitar parts. Drum parts and guitar tabs for nearly any popular or semi-popular song can be found on the Internet.

, Once people know that you have a band they will want you to play birthday parties and the like. You can also invite some people to your practice sessions, if everybody in the band agrees on it.

, Record a demo tape to send to some venues in your area, or look for some open-mic nights. These will help popularize your band outside of your school. You will attract popular high school and even college kids to your shows and they will enjoy your music. If you can't find a location, ask your school if you can use the gym, cafeteria, or parking lot.

, Just because you now have a huge fan base, you cannot slack off. Do bands like Fall Out Boy or Panic! At The Disco practice? Of course they do! Your skills will diminish if you do not keep practicing, and you will lose touch with your band members. Remember that they might have other offers, so you'll have to keep them interested.

, Finding the right practice area is hard. Not everyone has that kind of space. You also want to find a place close to all of the band members' houses so that it's easily accessible. Warehouses are open many times. If you DO have a garage and are not a part of a band, you could open it to someone who wants to use it, always be considerate. You and your band should agree with everything as far as where to play.

, Don't forget to have fun when you play music. If you're enjoying it, your audience will enjoy it. Have a good attitude when you play and don't expect things to always go your way. If someone quits your band, chances are they won't come back so just let it go. Host auditions at your school or neighborhood for a new musician. This gives your fans a chance to participate and getting a new musician is a big popularity boost for your band. Just remember to have fun and don't give up!


By 'bassist', it is generally an electric guitar bass. A stand-up bass works well for jazz and orchestral music, although it can be used in place of an electric if the musician is good enough and it is absolutely necessary. The fingerings for electric and acoustic basses are basically the same, so it is also very possible that a classic bassist can interchange between electric and classic.

You will need to choose the style of music for your group. How many people you have in the group, where you look for singers and instrumentalists, and how you get an agent or manager will all depend on the musical style.
Most of the popular styles for singing groups are madrigal, a capella, pop, hip-hop, vocal jazz, rock etc.
Where you look for your new group members will depend on what kind of group you want to make.
For example, if you want a religious singing group, you should look for members at church, or maybe people who sing in a church choir.
If you want people who can play instruments, you might want to ask people who are in band class at your school.;
, This will depend on a number of factors. Some styles of music will feature only 2 or 3 singers, whereas others such as pop or a capella can feature 5 or more.
You will need to decide on the gender of your members. Do you want an all girl or all guy group? Or a mixed group?
If you decide on a mixed gender group, you will also need to decide how many male voices and how many female voices you will need for the right sound.
If you are a rock or country group, you might only have one singer. Everyone else in the band will need a role other than back up singer. In groups like this, often there is a lead singer and a group of musicians that play guitar, bass, and drums. , To find people to join your group, you could organize some kind of audition so that people will come to you.You'll need to advertise the event (make fliers, tell everyone you know, put an ad in your local newspaper, etc.).
Post fliers around your school, at local businesses, at your church, and at local events.
Take out an ad in the newspaper. That can help interested musicians and singers find you.
Talk to people at your church or community center. They can help you spread the word about your group and the audition.
Try announcing the event on social media like Facebook and Twitter.
You can also post an ad on Craigslist and other websites.

, If you know people who are already in bands or singing groups, ask them if they know anyone who is currently looking to join a group. Post about it on social media.
Ask your old band or music teacher if they know anyone interested.
Do whatever you can to draw attention to your project so that you can find the talented people you'll need to be in your group.

, Even if all of the singing members have equal parts in the group, there still needs to be a designated leader.This will be the person who interacts with your manager, booking agents, members of the community and press.
This person will have to make sure the vision of the group remains intact.
Make sure its someone who can work with all the personalities in the group. Remember, you all have to be able to get along and collaborate effectively., A group will function better if everyone is clear on what roles they are supposed to play. Typically, parts are assigned based on people's skill level and talent in specific areas. If one group member has a beautiful tenor voice, it would be silly to assign them the alto singing parts.
One group member who is good at choreograph can be in charge of putting together dance routines.
Certain group members might be better at playing a certain instrument or singing a certain style better than others. Assign roles based on everyone's individual strengths and expertise.
In a rock group, it's probably going to be more likely that each person plays a different instrument and there is one lead singer.
Make sure everyone understands they can't always be in the spotlight. For example, not every rock song has a drum solo so your drummer can't always be featured. , Choosing your group's name is one of the most important decisions you'll make for your group early on.This is the name people will remember (or forget, if you choose a poor group name), the name you'll be endlessly promoting, and hopefully the name that will make you famous.
Think about what your group's name says about your style, your personalities, and how it fits with the kind of songs you want to sing.
Think of something catchy and bold. You'll want a name that is creative and draws an audience.

, You can't expect to shoot to stardom overnight without a well rehearsed repertoire of music. Start by doing covers of popular songs that everyone in the band likes.
If you are in a band where everyone plays an instrument, learn a few steady cover songs before trying to write your own material. At concerts, start out with cover songs and then gradually introduce your own material. Work out all the details, perfect your parts, and see what happened.
You should spend many, many hours practicing to make sure everything will be perfect when you actually start performing in front of people.
First impressions can be key. Make sure that your first public performance is well practiced.

, It is possible to manage yourselves, especially in the beginning of your group's career.


If you start accumulating gigs, it might be a good idea to look for someone with professional management experience to help your and your group members navigate the often complex music scene.
There are many benefits to having a band manager. For example, they can book gigs for you, help you find a connection with a recording studio, and help you manage your group's finances.
It is very important to hire a person that you trust completely to be your manager. Don't let someone scam you or push you in a direction you aren't comfortable with.
Remember, you'll have to pay them for their time and work. They will work for you very hard to help you succeed. You will need to agree on fair compensation for their time and effort.

, Perform for free at first, so you can develop a good reputation and a following.Meet on weekends with your group and perform on a street corner or park, though you should make sure this doesn't violate local ordinances.
Carry business cards with you about your group so you can pass them out to people who stop to listen.
Performing in front of a small crowd at first will help your group get comfortable in front of an audience. This can only help to improve the quality of your music.

, Ask your friends and neighbors if you can perform at parties they might be throwing. The more you get your group out there where people can hear you, the better.
Even if it is just at a small neighborhood party, it is still better for your group than not performing at all.
Volunteer to be entertainment at charity events and parties. This can really help your music and group get your name out.
Play at local fairs and community events. Once get a reputation you can start charging a small fee.

, See if your community has a local talent show of any kind and sign up.


This is a great way for you to become involved in the community, to get your music heard by a variety of people, and to open the door for new opportunities for your group.
Many now famous bands and musicians(like Rhiannaand Usher) got their start performing in small, local talent shows.

, Find out what clubs/bars/restaurants/venues have live music and ask how you would go about being considered for this gig.The venue might ask that you send them a demo tape or to come audition for them live.
Whatever they ask, make sure you take your time to prepare and present your group's best image.
Make sure the venue is appropriate for your type of group. For example, you wouldn't want to play at a hip-hop club if your style was more jazz or rock. Or if your style is loud and controversial, you'd want to avoid family friendly venues.

, This can be a good way to get short public performances and get noticed. If you know any other groups, offer to open up for them at concerts.
An opening act usually only performs a few songs and introduces the headlining band or group.
This is a great way for rock groups to get exposure. Sometimes, a headlining act will ask you to open for them on a short tour.

, Whenever you have an upcoming performance, make fliers and post them around your town.Make sure the fliers are exciting and attention-grabbing so that more people will take the time to look at them.
Have all the information such as location, time, date, and price of your gig.
Make sure you indicate whether your gig is all ages, 18+ or 21+ on your flier.

, Just a few years ago, people had no choice but to promote themselves by word of mouth, fliers, or radio ads alone.


The advancement of technology and the internet has made this kind of work so much easier and more effective.
Use the internet to your advantage and actively promote your group on popular social media platforms like FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
Having an online presence makes it easier for your fans to find you, for people to contact you about booking gigs, and to put your music out there for people to hear.

, Make sure your group members feel appreciated and valued. Let them know that you respect what they contribute to the group dynamic and that you wouldn't be where you are as a group without them.
Everyone needs to feel like they are an important part of the group.
Make sure everyone is kept informed of plans, gigs, and all events.
Don't leave anyone in the group out of the loop.
Avoid gossip. Don't spread rumors about other members of your group.

, It's easy to get caught up in the business aspects of making and practicing music together. Make sure that you make time to do some fun things together as a group.
Since you spend so much time together, it's important that you work on your friendship as much as you work on your vocals.
Take some time to go to a party together or spend a day at an amusement park. Whatever you do, just make sure you're having fun with your group members.
Participating in a sport or charity event can be a fun team building experience.

, Nothing will make a group feel more grounded in the same mission than performing well together. To get to this level, you must practice.
The more you practice, the less likely it is that one or more of you will make mistakes during performances.
Practice until every group member has the routine/songs memorized and can perform them flawlessly each time.

, Group meetings are a great way to make sure everyone is on the same page and that all of the group members are happy with they way things are going with your group.Making sure that every member feels like their opinion matters is important for keeping a group together, and a group meeting is a great platform to make that happen.
Talk about upcoming gigs and events to make sure everyone knows their obligations.
Use these meetings to divide up the work between group members. This can be anything from buying supplies, to coordinating with a venue, to advertising etc.
Make sure that if there are any problems in the group, they are discussed when everyone is there.
If there are conflicts in the group, remain calm and treat everyone with respect.

Determine what role you will fill in the band. Since you are putting together a group, you need to decide what your role will be. Perhaps you’ll sing or drum, for example. Be sure to stick with your talents. If you just started playing guitar, it may be better if a more experienced friend fills that role.;

, If you don’t have enough musically inclined friends to form a girl band of people you know, you’ll need to reach outside of your social circle. Be specific about the kind of members you want. Include the style of music you are hoping to play and some of your musical influences.


Post online to find members. The Internet is a great way to seek out other musicians. Facebook and other social media platforms often have special interest groups you can join and then write a post. You can ask friends to share your post to give it a wider reach. In addition, you can make an ad or visit the music forum for your city on Craigslist. Make a flyer. Create a flyer with information about the types of members you are seeking and the kind of group you want to form. Include your contact information. Post the flyer around town. If you live near a college, put it on a bulletin in the student union. You may also be able to ask local businesses if they will display the flyer for you.

, After spreading the word about your intention to start a girl band, it’s time to conduct an audition and select the right members for your group.


Schedule a time and have potential members come in and perform. Find a space and let the girls who have expressed interest know the time and place. Schedule specific appointments for each person. Let them know what to bring. It may be helpful to decide on some specific songs to have them play. Write down criteria for yourself. Determine the skills you are looking for in potential band members. For example, how experienced do you want your guitarist to be? You can ask girls to try different notes or chords to gauge their talents. For singers, ask for songs from different genres to get an idea of range.

, Pick the girls you think will be the best fit for the type of music you want to play. You may want to consider personality types as well to ensure everyone gets along.


Politely thank the people you didn’t choose. If there are any applicants who aren't a good fit now but might be a good back-up, let them down gently by saying: ""We have filled all the open spots right now, but it was a close call. We will let you know should a spot open up - we'd love for you to join.""

, Make a list of your favorite bands and write down what you like about each. Divide them into different categories based on genre. If you have varied tastes in music, this may help you narrow the style you want to play down a bit.

, Don't pick a style too far outside the range of what you can play. Although there's always an opportunity to improve your skills over time, for the sake of starting a band, you don't want to go too far outside your current skill set.


Experiment with different styles. Play around with your instruments and voice and see what sounds best to you. This helps you pick a sound. Go with what feels comfortable to you.

, The group will be much more cohesive if everyone wants to play the same thing. You can combine genres for your own unique sound, but it may work best to find members who want to perform the same type of music.


Allow everyone to incorporate something. Sit down and discuss your favorite music and ask each member what they want to bring to the band.

, This can be a fun part of starting a band! Pick something catchy that will be easy to remember. Take input from other members of the band so no one feels excluded. It may be a good idea to make a list of possible names and vote.


Conduct a quick online search to make sure the name you choose isn’t already taken. It’s easier than ever to start a band, but this means someone else may have already snagged your ideal band name. Plug the potential name into a search engine to know if it’s available.

, Without a space you can use regularly, it will be difficult to have frequent practices. A practice space can be a member's garage or basement. Be sure you won't disturb neighbors or roommates when you practice.


Rent a space if necessary. If none of the band members have spaces available, you may need to rent a space. Check local publications and online forums for people listing practice spaces.

, As a group of musicians just beginning to work together, practicing is key to developing your sound. Pick times that work for everyone in the group and start playing together.


Practice other groups’ songs. At the start of the girl band, playing music from other groups can your band work together. You will get more used to playing together and have a better idea about timing and areas that may need some more work.

, As you get used to playing together, you can start writing your own songs and practicing them. Write Song Lyrics that speak to you. This is a great way to develop your own musical style. Collaborate with band members. Work together as a team to create solid songs. For example, if you’re a good lyricist, you may need some help composing, or if you’re the band’s singer, you may not know how to arrange the other instruments. Collaborating with the other members of the band ensures you’re on the right track. , Once you have a few covers and your own songs, you can record them. Recording equipment can be expensive, but you may be able to create tracks with your computer. Many laptops already have programs to help you record and mix songs, and you can purchase add-ons like USB microphones and mixers. Blank CDs can be purchased from an office supply store. Set up a time to record. Get your band together and play your songs. It may be a challenge to get the song right on the first try, so be patient. You may want to schedule multiple sessions. Design a cover. Make the CD look attractive and professional. You can use a photograph of the band for the cover or create your own art.
Start sharing the CD. Get your music out there! Give copies of the CD to friends and family. You can use CDs as a tool to promote your band by giving them out, or you can sell them for a small fee at shows.

, Trying to gain a following for a new band is much easier with social media. Facebook allows you to create fan pages. You can direct friends to follow it, and it also can help people contact you to schedule shows. Promote your band. Don’t just set up a social media page and leave it. To grow your audience, post updates regularly. You can also use these platforms to share new music. Post to interact with fans. Take photos at shows or while you're practicing and share them. Post new songs. This gives fans a place to comment and engage with you.
Hold contests. You can post questions to fans and offer prizes, such as a CD or tickets to an upcoming show.

, Whether it’s in a backyard, garage, local venue, college, or bar, playing shows helps your girl band attract more attention. In the beginning, they may be smaller, but your band can book larger venues as it gets more popular.


Research venues in your area. Looking up theaters and bars that host performances can be a good way to get gigs. Look online and see if the venue has contact information for the employee who books shows. Otherwise, you can personally go to the venue and ask for the contact.

, If you have serious musical ambitions, you will need to continue promoting your group and playing shows. This may help bring the attention of a label, which can fully launch your career.

Have fun!",How to Make a Local Band,"


Whether you want to be a rock, punk, metal, or any other kind of band, you need to know what music you want to play.;
,


Rock bands generally have a guitarist, a bassist, a vocalist, and a drummer. Some may also have a keyboardist for extra effect, but this, and everything else, is totally optional. You would need to have at least two people for a band, though, so you should probably have at least two or three instruments as well (the vocalist might or might not play an instrument, your choice). Find what kind of sound you want and get people who play instruments for your sound.

,


Most people don't pay attention to things like this, but you need to make sure that your musicians are fair and kind to each other. If this quality is not present, it may cause fights and a feeling of superiority within some band members. You also need people who are interested in the type of music that you want your band to play, and who will stick with it if at all possible. You most likely won't become famous, so just try to get people who want to have fun. If you do make it big, though, you might want to be a bit more serious about your music though.
Some things you can do to get people to join your band are post flyers around your neighborhood. Be sure to include an age limit, the type of music you play, and what instrumentalists you need, as well as information on whether or not they need their own instruments, or if your band needs a place to practice, etc.

,


Try to think of something original that all of your band mates like. Brainstorm some ideas before voting on it. Some good things to think of while thinking of a band name is poems or songs you like, you can take a part of its name and use it in your own. You can also use something like an inside joke or a combo word of two things you like, e.g. the color purple and cats might be The Kurple. You can also mess with spellings and such, as I have just demonstrated.

,


Start off with covers of your favorite songs, instrument tabs and lyrics can be found on the internet for almost every song ever recorded. Once you think you can do better, try to come up with your own songs. Work with your bandmates and either figure out something that sounds good together, then write lyrics to it, or write lyrics and figure out a tune. Write about things that interest you in your songs, some topics that are commonly chose are politics, relationships, and having fun. Try to make it have meaning, and the song will most likely end up a lot better.

,


You can start out with having shows right out of a garage, basement, or even a front yard. Any place is fine, just keep the noise level at a reasonable level if you're outside playing. You don't want to get a fine for public disturbance. You should probably start out with doing free shows, and if people start loving your music, then you can charge a modest fee of a couple dollars or so for your show. Keep in mind that a garage isn't a very good venue, so you shouldn't charge too much, if any at all. With that said, you cannot charge for shows where you play a cover of a song. This is illegal unless you get the artist/label's permission, and this usually includes paying a royalty.

,


This is probably one of the hardest steps to do if you don't have many friends. If you do, then good job. First, tell all of your friends who are into the music that your band plays. Get the word out that you have a band, and that you're awesome. Get them to tell everyone they know about your show, like where it will be and what time. You may want to put up flyers advertising your band in such places as a community bulletin board. These can be found in schools, churches, and certain grocery stores. Telephone poles and trees also offer good spots. Make your flyers colorful and have something big on it to catch peoples' eyes.

,


This is where you really build up a fan base (if you're good). Call local bars and places that have live music (make sure that the bar hosts underage bands if you're underage first) and ask about auditions. If your band really rocks it, and you get the gig, then you will most likely get paid. And the best part is that you get paid for doing what you love. If the place that you play at really likes you, then they might ask you to come back, and other places might have been to your show so they can ask you to go to their venue. You'll be touring across the country before you know it.

,


This is the most important part of having a band. After all, the whole reason you started the band was so that you can have fun playing music. If you started it for money or other reasons, then you might as well quit. If you don't have fun, you might as well quit also, because there would be no point of doing it if you don't like it.

Above all - continue to practice!",How to Make a Band and Get Discovered," There are several avenues to accomplish this goal. First, put out fliers saying you're looking to make a band (make an interview or audition). If you know the genre of music you want to play, decide what kinds of instruments you will need and make sure to mention who/what you're looking for in your fliers (e.g. Looking for a jazz trumpet player). Also, post the fliers in places where you'll get the best results. Posting fliers for rock musicians in a jazzy coffee shop won't get you many replies.;
, You may want to interview the musician on their musical interests and work ethic as well to ensure that you will be compatible.

, Make sure the practice place is accessible to everyone, and easy to use. If the practice area is a 30 minute drive for your drummer, he/she will probably get fed up with having to load/unload the drum set over and over.

,, Be sure to make these practices productive. If you spend the whole time sitting around talking about the latest sports event, your band will not succeed (unless you're really lucky).

, This will often come about once the band starts to work together and gel. Every individual's style will come together to form a unique sound.

, This includes an interesting band name and wearing certain clothes to live shows. If someone hears a hardcore band on stage they sound really great and then they look up and see a bunch of middle aged men with beer bellies wearing wife beaters and mesh shorts they are going to be turned off by them. They want what they see to match what they're hearing.

, Many bands have 1 or 2 members who write the basics for every song and then let the band take it from there. Other bands may write while jamming with the entire group, although this may take longer.

, If you are serious about your band, and have the funds, you can look into booking some time at a studio. This will be expensive compared to a tape recorder, but the quality will be greatly improved and may result in your band being hired more often. Plus, it'll give you a good quality recording to play for your family and friends until you can get a real album recorded.

, Call the local clubs and ask if you can play. Find parties to play at. If you're in school, sign up for the talent show, or ask to play at lunch for your peers. By starting small, you can get a taste of how audiences react, what to do when you get better gigs, and make a little bit of spending cash.

, There is a section where club managers and event planners post gig information. These will often be paying gigs and are great ways to expose your band to the public.

, They know how the business works and who to talk to.

, A few hours in a studio with an experienced engineer can produce wonders. If your band has been performing and practicing together regularly, you should be able to go from one song to the next, just as if it were a gig. House Of The Rising Sun by the Animals was recorded in one take because they had toured with the song for so long, it was second nature. Once you have a quality recording of your band, send it to record companies and radio stations. You can also produce CDs and sell them at your gigs.

, Myspace.com is a great way to expose your band to the public and there are many other sites with similar programs that are free and work very well, and as much as you may not want to give your music away for free because trust me it really really does help! But remember not many famous bands started off with a Myspace page


Make some sort of website for your band and upload downloadable content so that people from all over the world can listen to your music. Also video yourself doing performances and post them to YouTube. This works well in helping your band become popular.







, Family, friends, people you meet at McDonald's. Get as much exposure as you possibly can.

, You can create 20 or so copies for a good price and spread them around town. They'll catch peoples eyes and bring more people to your gigs.

,, If you have stage fright, just find a dark place in the back of the location to look whenever you get nervous. That way you won't be unnerved by your cheering fans.

, You may want to rewrite or redirect songs as your band/sound evolves. This is perfectly okay. It gives you something new and exciting to play, and it gives your fans something to look forward to. Also, try not to get too confident and cocky and don't practice. If you want to have a good band, remember; practice a lot.

Choose what songs you will be playing.,
About a week before you have your first practice session, get together and pick five songs you all agree on to learn.,

But there is nothing worse than wasting an entire practice arguing over what songs to play, or not being able to do anything because you don't know the songs!

, This shouldn’t be tough, seeing as you should have picked band members with similar musical interests as you.

, It doesn’t have to be perfect, and it won’t be! But it’s good to have at least a rough idea of what you’re doing.

, Guitar, Bass, Keyboard, Saxophone-whatever. Have them with you, because when you all forget what you’re doing everyone will be grateful you brought them!

, So you’ve all got the tabs/chords/lyrics/whatever else down. Now you need to check you’re in time with each other, with some songs it’s fairly easy, but others will require you to have a metronome. Don’t have one? Have your vocalist clapping to regulate your timing.

, If you play it more than that, most likely you’ll all hate the song afterwards, you’ll all never want to play it again and it will be a waste of a perfectly good practice.

,,, Some bands write original songs right away, this is normally the approach of more seasoned musicians, but can be done by anyone assuming they know basic song structures and chords.;
, Also agree upon whether a single person will be doing majority of the writing, the band will all write together, etc.

,, If all else fails, bring a sheet with them on with you.


This can be done in two different ways, music first, or lyrics first. The easiest way to create music is to strum guitar chords, other band members can then chip in with their own additions to the strumming with other simple parts. It is a good idea to make a habit of recording/filming this for playback later when writing the lyrics.
So you’ve had a little jam session, sweet! Next up though is possibly the hardest part of song writing the lyrics. So it’s time to playback what you were doing, sit around and see what you can all come up with. There are plenty of other articles to advise you on the song writing process, so I will not cover it here.

, But now it is time to edit the lyrics, get your vocalist to at last join in with you (these singers have it so easy). Now the lyrics have a sound of their own, but it might now necessarily work with your singers voice. Tweak the lyrics to fit perfectly. E.g.; ‘Hating you is easier than gluing your singer probably, won’t be able to sing all that, so you change it so it does fit, ‘hating you is easier than glue’.

, Record your song and slam it on Myspace or something !


Now lyrics before music can be tricky. But it works for some artists better than the music then lyrics method. So let’s assume you’ve written your lyrics with the band/on your own and everyone likes what the song has to say.
Most likely, guitar strumming to start with, much like in the first method. You can add more depth and detail to it later. Band members join in, you get the idea.
Now vocals: the music won’t fit first time. This can assure you. The music might be completely wrong. But if you like the song, stick to it. Keep at it until the music does fit.
It can help to have vocals first, this will give the other band members a vague idea as to pitch and timing.

, Once again record your song and slam it on Myspace or something!

With the fame you've gotten, you have people listening to you.",How to Get a Band and Get Famous,"


First, you need to know what kind of music you want to make. You can also do that after you have the members. If you want to get famous, metal might not be a great choice, since it's not exactly mainstream, it's harder to get noticed (though it pays off more if you do get noticed). Rock or pop might be better if you're really aiming for fame, but remember that the music has to suit you, for it to work (more easily). Be sure that you know the types of music and what they require.
Find people willing to play with you. They don't even have to be good (yet), though it would really help. Pick a front woman (that's usually the vocalist, since they already have to use their voice), that's the person that does the talking in the beginning of shows etc. The common, basic setup exists of a vocalist, a guitarist and a drummer. A bass player isn't required, but definitely recommended. Keys (piano, keyboard) are optional, just like any other instrument. Music is a creative thing, so let your imagination go free and come up with an original setup. Make sure the instruments go well with each other though. Originality will definitely get people talking about you, automatically getting you more known.
Think of an original name for the band together. Something catchy, that people will remember. Nothing too difficult, something simple and obvious can be great! (Metallica; how simple do you want it?) Something random can work out really well too, just make sure your band will be found when people search for it online and don't get that random thing all the time (of course in the beginning your site won't even be found by the search engine at all, but that'll change as you get more known). Make sure another band doesn't already have the name you want. Be really careful with that, cause you could get sued for using a name that's already claimed. Band names with two words usually work best.;
,


Writing a song isn't just the lyrics, it's the music too.
According to some (and I must say, I agree) most bestsellers are really bullshit, so making shitty songs may work. It's true that the majority of the population doesn't really care about what it is, as long as it's catchy and they're able to sing along. Remember: Las Ketchup, etc.
As you get a little more known (or even before that), do work on at least some decent songs. Making a hit might be fun, but you want to be famous, meaning: you want to be remembered. So just a hit won't work for you, you'll have to write good songs too to keep attention (Metallica, Michael Jackson).

,, Tell people about it, anyone you know (and don't know). Friends, family, people in your class(es) at school, at work, people you've met online... Anyone. And tell them to tell other people about it too. You never know who has the right connections.

,


Get a site and have it look professional. That doesn't mean it has to be boring, but it should be easy to navigate, not all chaotic and it has to be easy to read (no spelling and/or grammar mistakes all over the place, some crazy unreadable font or the background image making the text nearly invisible).
As you probably already know, Myspace is a good, easy start. Having your own site is good too, but don't waste any time on that yet, till people at least remember your name. Put some songs on it or complications/just (the best) parts of songs.
Use the right keywords on your site and register your site/Myspace in directories and major search engines (Google, Yahoo, MSN-search etc.)
Exchanging links with other (starting) bands works too.
Get on forums, sites and chatrooms. Don't go spamming or trolling though! It's really annoying, gives you(r band) a bad name and it'll probably get you kicked or banned.

, People like to see who/what they're listening to. Make pictures of the band (and of each member separately) and pick some for the Myspace. If you all have some time, make a video for one of your songs. Just a video that introduces you all could work too.

, (Skate shops, music stores, certain clothing stores etc.)

, Ask people if they have any connections I was talking about in step 1.

, If you want to become a famous band, obviously none of you can have it. Of course it doesn't matter if one, some or all of you do, but make sure to get over it before you get asked to perform. Practice by not skipping classes where you have to show and tell, do speeches in front of the class and when there's someone needed to talk in front of a group, volunteer. You'll find out that being well prepared is the key. It'll also gain you experience of standing in front of a group, knowing what it takes to get you into it, how to get the crowd pumped, what you have to do to not fail etc.

, In the basement, as a street artist, at school shows, talent shows, at youth centers, open bars, birthdays, maybe even funerals or weddings. At other places that vary per facility there might be a possibility to perform too (a mall, a garage, bowling center etc.). Invite all your friends, ask them to bring people to and don't make them pay for it. You can ask for donations though. If you're not good, your audience will get what they paid for, right? Also; you're just starting out, so people will be less likely to pay for a band. Think about it; would you? If they like it, they'll tell people about it and they'll want to hear more of you.

, That's different for every band. Some have a certain image (Marilyn Manson, Slipknot), a special move (Michael Jackson), a piece of clothing (a hat, a tie, anything) worn in a certain way, a line they always say or sound they make...

, Always remember to stay humble and remember you're still just a regular person, with all the needs of any other human being. Never forget where you came from and who supported you.

, Although they make your life easier and luxurious, my opinion is to always think twice before you buy something (for yourself) and consider whether you really need it or not and if you could spend your money on something better. (I'm striving for minimalism, I'm not trying to push my opinions on you, but just advising.)

, You have the ability to reach out to people. Your fans and especially people who might idolize you will definitely follow your example. Don't abuse this 'power', but rather use it for good. The more people you have listening to you, the less effort it takes to make the world a better place. Besides, doing good things (standing up for human/animal rights or the environment, even just being associated with it) is a great promotion as well.

, You'll want someone who can perform death growls, bellows & screams, but can also sing in tune too. It's quite commonplace for the singer to play rhythm guitar, but it depends on the amount of energy they want to bring to their performance.

, Rapid-fire staccato solos are a staple of the genre. Someone who channels inspiration from Kerry King's or Kirk Hammett's meaty riffs would be ideal.

, The low-end churn of a 4 or 5-string may get lost under the layers of guitars, but Thrash metal needs more people like the late Cliff Burton. Bassists can always compensate for their lack of sound by going on an extended solo or performing some live vocals.

, The fiery double-bass passages & tom-heavy fills of Lars Ulrich & Dave Lombardo have inspired generations of new rock drummers, so you'll have no problem finding the right sticks-man for the job. They'll need the energy to perform for hours at a time & to be as dexterous with their feet as they are with their hands.

, You'll probably want to play Jackson or ESP Guitars, Fender or Warwick Basses (all with Marshall Amplifiers) & Tama or Pearl Drums. Some artists also get picked up by purveyors of trainers or sports drinks, but they have to take the back seat to the actual music.

Know the instruments you play.,Before you do anything else make sure you can read Tableture and Sheet music

,
Now it's time to find some band members.,
Start to practice and get better at your music.,
Find a Vocalist.,
Get a Lead Guitarist.,
Get a Rhythm Guitarist.,
Find a Bassist.,
Get a Drummer.,
(Optional) Expand your range of sounds with a Keyboardist.",How to Form a Metalcore Band," If you are good at drums, drum. If you've got the aggressive vocals and ability to scream, sing.;
,, always look for friends that have decent skill with an instrument and time for the band. IF you can't, look around the internet for musicians in your area.

, Once you're good enough you can start to write your own music. It is suggested that you start out covering other metalcore bands to get a feeling for the genre. Start with Hatebreed, Converge or I Am War.

, A good vocalist is important.He should be able to perform screams at an enjoyable level using correct technique. The screams should fit the music and mood. Avoid inhale screaming.

, Needless to say lead guitar is vital to your metalcore band. He should be able to play solos and pretty much know his way around his guitar.

, The rhythm guitarist, or what I like to call 2nd guitar is usually misconceived as the ""the other guy"". Musicians looking to be in metalcore bands need to realize 2nd guitar is extremely important in this genre and most metal and rock in general. They don't have to just play the power chords from the chorus. They give the guitar parts harmony and maybe a tad dissonance (which is good for the genre!). They are like Yin and Yang (as it relates to the driving force of metalcore which is the guitars). But even if you're rhythm guitarist isn't at the same level as lead, it's a great way to have him learn new stuff along the way without embarrassing himself live.

, Some also might think bass is ""just another guitarist"", but in metalcore, bass is vital almost more vital than lead guitar! It gives us the ""oomph"". You know. The heavy feel. Metalcore is heavy music so you need bass! The bassist is also the 2nd biggest part of a BREAKDOWN! And even if you don't know how to play incredibly fast bass parts (it would be cool if you could though), all you need is a sense beat and good strumming.

, A good drummer is normally what you NEED to worry about when starting a metalcore band. He NEEDS to know double bass. Although, he doesn't need to overdo it or need to know how to do it insanely fast (but it's good if he does know), but it's a skill every drummer in the genre use. But if your drummer sucks at double bass. fret not! You could always try an Underoath kind of style. No double bass. More kind of a hardcore punk feel. Your drummer is also the most important part of a breakdown. Bass is next. Then guitars. FOLLOW DRUMS!

, Synthesizers and programmed laptop beats are becoming more commonplace in this style of music. Current purveyors of Electronicore are Asking Alexandria and Enter Shikari from England, Motionless in White and Attack Attack! from the United States and We Butter the Bread with Butter from Germany. While they and others groups use keyboards in different ways, if you want to include electronics in your band, listen to these bands to understand their appeal.

Remember the good old days.,
Learn about what inspired these groups.,
Start gauging interest online.,
Get a Singer with a wide vocal range.,
Get a guitarist (two would be preferable).,
Try to Make the guitars sound truly nu metal.,
Get a bassist.,
Get a drummer.,
Depending on your preferences, get a DJ.,
Find a good producer to help you make an album.",How to Form a Nu Metal Band," Go down to your local music store, they're bound to have loads of nu metal albums & at low prices too because some of them are over 15 years old. A good selection to purchase are (but not limited to) Korn's Follow the Leader, Deftones' Adrenaline, Limp Bizkit's Three Dollar Bill Yall$ & Slipknot's eponymous debut. Blast them out your speakers really loudly to attract interest from passers-by.;
, Korn didn't create a whole genre without a bit of help from the bands they listened to. Their influences are as diverse as Pink Floyd, Metallica, Sepultura, Nine Inch Nails, Ice Cube, Tool, Faith No More & Pantera. Deftones started putting hints of The Cure into their music & Limp Bizkit drew heavily from rap metal band Rage Against the Machine.

, When nu metal started out, everything had to be done with ink & paper flyers distributed around local music scenes. Thanks to the rise of the internet, you can now use Facebook, Twitter & other social networks to gain support. Ask whether the demand is there for nu metal to return & start looking for fellow musicians to audition.

, Nu metal has a great variety of styles to draw from, including rapping, singing, scatting, yelling, death growls & whispers, sometimes all in the same song. Hiring someone with an erratic & unpredictable on-stage presence will fuel live performance situations & make your new group stand out from the rest.

, If you can find someone with a unique playing style all the better. Munky from Korn & Mick Thompson from Slipknot use a wide range of effect pedals to create sounds of scratchy DJ turntables & wailing emergency sirens, & Limp Bizkit's Wes Borland plays with both of his hands driving the sound. It can be hard to find a musician that sounds incredibly distinct, so don't ""fret"" if you can't find one. 

, The earliest bands eschewed the standard E Tuning (EADGBE) in favor of Drop A, the lowest possible tuning from a standard guitar. Korn in particular would play with 7-string Guitars tuned AEADF#BE, but Drop C Tuning (CGCFAD) eventually took over as the choice of later artists.

, Choose someone who knows how to make their instrument stand out, because now they have to compete with guitars that are tuned almost a thunderously low. Try listening to the basslines of Korn's Reginald ""Fieldy"" Arvizu, who uses the Fingerslap technique to create percussive funk tones. Just like the guitars, the extra string makes all the difference, so try playing a bass with 5 or even 6 strings.

, Try finding a sticksman who's inspired by other genres of music (Funk, Latin, Hip-hop etc.) & can play very loudly & aggressively. The drum kit can be as minimalist or extravagant as you want, but you'll probably want at least three tom drums, a kick drum, lots of dark & trashy cymbals like Zildjian Ks & Sabian HHXs, a large snare drum & a smaller side snare for playing Hip-hop beats.

, Artists like DJ Lethal from Limp Bizkit & #0 from Slipknot use turntables, sample pads & keyboards to enhance the broody guitars sounds. They can be very subtle & atmospheric (as they are in Deftones for example) or in-your-face like the previous artists' styles. Remember from earlier that some bands prefer to use guitars to make these sounds. Check out ""Bullet in the Head"" or ""Bulls on Parade"" by Rage Against the Machine for a greater idea of how a guitarist would sound over a DJ.

, Though he's since discredited the genre, Ross Robinson was responsible for the debuts of Korn (along with their 2nd & 9th LPs), Limp Bizkit & Slipknot, & also turned Thrashers Sepultura & Machine Head onto the movement, so he would be the best man for the job. Other recommended producers are Rick Rubin, Terry Date, Don Gilmore & Nick Raskulinecz. If you have no chance of contacting these people, find someone in your area who can help you, or produce the album yourself, a surprising amount of artists do this.

Find practical interests that you can use on tour.,
Consider a formal education at a college or university.,
Go to live music shows and meet people in the scene.,
Do research on the live music industry.",How to Become a Band Roadie1," Do independent research on lighting, instruments, and sound and stage production. Find a niche that interests you the most and expand your knowledge around it. You can work on a variety of aspects of the performance including things like wardrobe, makeup, stylist, rigger, security, manager, lighting technician, or sound mixer.Take your current interests or hobbies and try to translate that into a job that you can do on tour.
Think about experiences in the past that could help you work on a tour. For instance, if you worked as a stagehand for a school play then you already have a basic understanding of lighting and sound.
If you're good at negotiating with people and keep on a strict and organized schedule, you may want to become a band manager.
Read up on the most commonly used equipment and learn how to operate it because it will give you an advantage over your competitors.;
, While a bachelor's degree isn't a requirement to becoming a band roadie, getting a formal education may be beneficial and could give you the skills that would make you desirable to have on the road. Look for colleges that have music, sound, or stage production majors and consider pursuing a bachelor's degree.


Many crew members now have their formal education in a field that relates to touring with a band, such as a degree in sound-production or music.Some of the best colleges for sound and music production include, Academy of Art University, the Peabody Institute, and Full Sail University.Concentrate on electives that will give you the skills you'll need on the road, like lighting or rigging.

, Try to become friends with as many people as you can who are interested in music. Search for show dates and times near you and attend your local venues regularly. Seek out those that are actively in a band or who work as a band roadie themselves. Ask them questions about their experiences on the road and how they got into touring.


Make it a point to be outgoing and introduce yourself to everyone.
You can say something like, ""Hey, so I heard Death Rattle toured a couple months ago? What was that like? I always wanted to tour the country.""

, Get a better understanding what it takes to tour and the music industry in general.Read autobiographies or watch interviews of people who have toured and internalize their experiences. Understand the good and bad about touring and realize that it's not always a fantasy. Often while you tour you must endure crowded buses, long trips, and get very little sleep. You may find out through your research that living the band roadie life is not for you.


Popular books that deal with touring include, ""A Journey Through America with the ""Rolling Stones"","" ""Diary of a Rock ‘n’ Roll Star,"" and ""Billion dollar baby: A provocative young journalist chronicles his adventures on tour as a performing member of The Alice Cooper Rock-and-Roll Band.""Make sure that you read industry reports to see what's trending to help you make your decision."
"
Volunteer your time.,
Work backstage for your high school or college theater.,
Reach out to local bands.,
Inform the creatives of technical limitations.",How to Become a Band Roadie2," Volunteer opportunities to get experience being a band roadie may not be as difficult to find as you may think. While getting a job on the road with no experience is unlikely to happen, it's possible that you could volunteer at other places that will give you the similar experience. Go to local theaters and talk directly with staff. Inquire if you could volunteer your time and work on the job. They may be more convinced if you have some level of prior experience.


Many music camps are also looking for volunteers to perform basic roadie tasks like breaking down lighting equipment and fixing and operating sound equipment for the camp.You can say something like, ""Hey, my name's Garrett. I was wondering if you guys needed any volunteers or help setting up or breaking down for bands. I'm looking to get into being a crew member and I need to get some experience first.""

, Working backstage for a musical performance in your school will give you the practical experience to help a band during a performance. Register to become part of the stage crew. Take opportunities to work on the stage crew and learn everything that you can. The more versatile you are, the more likely that you can eventually land a position working with a band that tours.


On stage crew you can learn things like sound prep, lighting, makeup, and managing., Many tour roadies begin their career with a local band.Smaller bands may not always have the money to pay roadies, so they are less likely to expect you to have a lot of experience. If you do well and have good chemistry with the band, they may want to take you with them when they go on tour.


Even if they don't end up going on tour, you'll still get valuable experience that you can use as leverage when looking for a paid job.

, If you get a job in sound or lighting, it's possible that the group you're working for will request something that's unsafe or not technically or financially feasible. In these cases, it's best to be as transparent as you can with them. Part of your job is being able to find solutions to complex problems or issues, but the other part of your job is to be a knowledgeable, reliable, and safe


Instead of saying that it can't be done, try to come up with a compromise or solution that can satisfy the producers or performers.
For instance, you can say something like ""A suspended dragon probably won't be possible on the schedule we are trying to keep, but I've thought of a solution. Instead of having a physical dragon, we can do a projection of a dragon behind you to simulate it.""

Apply to gigs at music venues or stadiums.,
Search for job openings on roading-specific job boards.,
Reach out to your favorite bands to see if they need help.,
Use your networking connections to get a job.,
Set up your own crew and do contract work.",How to Become a Band Roadie3," Sometimes stadiums or music venues will put out job ads for a large event that they are having. Having this experience may open the doors for you to apply to future positions if you do well. Visit popular job boards like Craigslist and Indeed and search for tour roadie or crew member jobs. Alternatively, you can look up positions at local theaters like production assistant or stage crew and get experience with a local theater.


Jobs that are available at venues or stadiums include janitorial staff, lighting and sound engineers, event planners, security, set up and break down crews, ticket cashiers, and food staff.Sometimes when venues need general help they won't require any previous experience.
Look for venues that need help as soon as possible as they will be more likely to hire someone with no experience.

, There are several roadie specific job boards that contain listings for jobs related to roadies. Sometimes these websites will require you to create an account before you can view open positions.Make sure that you have an updated resume and choose jobs that meet your level of experience.


Some of the most popular roadie specific job boards include, Roadiejobs.com and Crewspace.com.

, Try to find the contact information of your favorite band on their website, or look for the manager's information and contact them to see if they need any help on the road. Long hours and intense travel mean that many people can't live the roadie lifestyle. For this reason, you may be able to get a job on the road with your favorite band even if it seems unrealistic.


You can search for band's contact information using popular search engines, however many times response rates are low.Try reaching out to the band or crew manager via social media to see if there are any job openings.

, Talk to friends that are involved in the music industry and ask them if they know of any jobs that are available in the field. If you know bar or venue owners, they may be able to make an exception for you and provide you a job with no experience. If you went for your formal education, past teachers or mentors could also point you in the right direction.


You can say something like, ""I'm having a hard time finding a job. Do you know of anyone that needs a good lighting person right now?""

, Once you have the proper experience in the field that you enjoy, try to develop a team of crew members. Select people that have experience and knowledge in places that you don't. Many people are looking for lighting, sound, or visual technicians and will regularly contract work out to them.Create a business page and a website so that venues and bands can reach out to you.
Network with existing contacts to see if there's anyone that's in search of your skills. Once you get a couple of jobs under your belt, see if your prior customers can refer you to other businesses that need your services.
If you have a reliable and knowledgeable crew, it will be easy to take on projects that require a lot of different types of work.
You may also want to obtain a business license for your crew.
Since you won't always be on tour, you'll need to be able to supplement your tour work with work that you can do while you're off-tour.
The more jobs you get as a freelancer the more reputable your work will become.

Get your band together.,
Think of a style that makes you unique.,
Get on the same wavelength.,
Get tight.,
Get a name.,
Get your set together.,
Get gigs.,
Get writing.,
Get recorded.,
Get heard.,
Get seen.",How to Get Your Band Famous," This might seem obvious, but there are many bands out there who are trying to get famous, each of whom are still looking for a specific type of band member. Depending on your style of music you will need different instruments, but make sure you have everyone you need when you start. Also try to ensure that everyone has roughly the same skill in their roles, as this way you will all develop at the same rate in talent.;
, One thing that often makes a band famous, well-loved, and importantly, recorded, is if they have a unique flair that stands out. Dare to be different; don't let the commercial world influence anything you try. Sure, think about what kinds of music people like to listen to, and think about what will appeal to others, but don't be afraid to try something people haven't seen before. You can give an instrument unique sounds or you can use an instrument that isn't used often. e.g. electric violin, or you can use something modified like instead of using drums you could be the first band to use electronic drums.

, Your band will have to work together as one efficient unit in order to get anywhere in the music world. In the beginning you should all agree on certain genres of music to play. Do not play any music that even one person doesn't want to play. This is when the cracks will start to show. Make proper joint decisions, and don't ignore the opinion of anyone.

, Before you begin to write your own music, start off playing cover songs. This will help the fluidity of your music in the future, and allow each individual band member to recognize and get used to the other members style of playing. This will involve practicing at least twice a week. This involves great commitment, and each member of the band must be willing to commit an equal amount of effort to the band.

, Even though you're not an original band yet, you will need a band name. This is generally something that happens naturally as you practice, when people start throwing names around. Pick something original. You can always Google it to make sure it's not already taken. When choosing your name make sure it suits your genre; you can't exactly call a metal band 'The Happy Bunnies'.

, Pick the songs you've practiced most and that you are best at, then string them together to make a set that is about thirty minutes to forty minutes long. Generally, you should have two fast songs then one slow song, two fast songs, one slow song etc. in all your sets, though this can be worked around.

, Once you believe you work well enough to play a gig, play anywhere, any time, even if you don't get paid. The best way to find these gigs is to search for small local bands running gigs in or near your area. At the moment you're unheard of, and no matter how good you think you are, you still won't get paid. If you want you could always organise your own gig in your locality if you want to make some money.

, After a month or two of playing gigs, and probably about 4 to 5 months of general practice and jamming, start to write and compose your own songs. This will be a difficult process at the start, but do not be deterred, soon all the pieces will fall in to place. When you have your songs written, practice them over and over again, allowing to change parts and get tight when playing them.

, This is going to cost you between a small amount and a massive amount. Go to a professional recording studio if you can afford it, but don't go to the most expensive at first because it's often not worth it, especially if it's your first set of original songs. Take about five days off work, school or college in order to record between four and six songs to make an E.P.

,


After you have recorded get the masters of the songs, and the original mix. Burn the original mix to a couple of hundred blank CDs, or alternatively, get them published by a professional company. Either way, give them out for free to anyone who wants them. There's no point trying to sell someone something they haven't heard before, but if they get it for free at least they will listen to it.
Get videos and photos together, and make sure they're good quality because you never know when some form of press will be looking at them.

Simple music videos are relatively easy to make. Get a live video of the band playing the song you want to make the music video for. Remove the audio and place the professionally recorded audio over it instead. Try to mix it a little. If you are not confident in using video editing software, get a friend to do it.



,


Get a friend who is doing photography in college or as an avid hobby to take pictures of the band, both live, and in posed shots. Put a selection of the best up on your sites.
Get some sort of logo. In this day and age, we all know someone who's a whiz kid on Photoshop. Get this person to run up a few different logos based around your name and genre. Make it simple and easy to draw.
Run up a few simple t-shirts if you have the money and give them to your friends. The t-shirts should contain your band logo and website.

Myspace and other networking sites are a great resource for unheard bands. On Myspace you have the option of allowing anyone to download your songs for free which is an excellent idea at the beginning.
When setting up your website, make it yourself or get a friend to do it, and don’t waste money on a domain when you can get a free one. All it really needs is your logo, your name, links to your social network pages, some of your tracks, a video or two and your best photos.
Try to audition as a band on TV shows like The X Factor, that's the way One Direction became the famous band we all know now! If you're refused somewhere practice and audition somewhere else!

"
"
Think hard, be real, and come to an agreement on the direction of the tunes you want to play.,
Talk about the band to others (no, don't brag... just chat).,
Know your stuff.,
Practice regularly.,
Communicate before and after practices.,
Get a communal calendar that you all can get to (Google, spreadsheet, or a wall calendar).,
Have an agreement on how much (or how little) money the band will play for, so that any band mate with the calendar can speak for the band to play any job offered (""cool"", ""sorry, we need a little more gas money to play"").

,
Set up the band equipment like you are at a job, if you have the space.,
Learn your parts of tunes before practice.,
Have a set list for each job.,
Designate an air traffic controller for jumping into the pocket (often the drummer or the bandleader).,
Playing to the crowd is often less satisfying as a band member (you might not play your best or hardest tunes), but having the crowd jumping on the dance floor is very cool, very fun, and very entertaining to watch while you play.

,
When things screw up (and they DO) don't let it show.",How to Get a Rock Band out of the Basement," This is often driven by the places you can play. If you are in your mid-teens, you (generally) cannot play in bars. The set list for a house party is usually different than it is for a bar, or for a outdoor festival. Very few places want bands that play all original songs, unless you are dragging the entire crowd into the joint (by fliers, word of mouth, reputation).;
, Everybody knows somebody who knows someone who (eventually) wants a live band somewhere. Opportunities will present themselves - it's up to you to recognize them and act upon them.

, Learn your instrument, focus on what you can do the be a better part of the whole. Learn to sing and play. Learn to play more than one instrument. Learn to write music, write lyrics, or write both. Let the other members worry about themselves; that way the only person you have a right to be angry with is yourself.

, Same night, same time, same setup. Home base.

, Ever show up to a practice only to find that the song was learned by different guys in different keys? Email and text messages are quick and cheap, but very essential.

, Have everyone associated with band jobs mark the calendar for when they can play and when they can't be there - that way anyone can look at the calendar and say ""yes"" or ""sorry, no"" to any job opportunity on very short notice.

,, This helps find bad cords, broken things, dead spots ""on stage"" for vocal monitors, and helps moderate instrument volumes. All instruments should be just as loud as the drums. If someone wants to hear themselves louder, move their equipment closer to their head so that person is happy, and the other players are not suffering bleeding ears. The volume in practice should be the same as live on stage so there are no surprises, no differences in sound for the players (you will feel comfortable like being at the practice space).

, You can get a heck of a lot done when everyone comes prepared.

, Have extra tunes in case (the ""pocket""). Have a plan, follow the plan. If the crowd is not reacting like you'd expect or hope, pull tunes from the pocket and see what happens. The pocket (reacting to the crowd) is part of the plan.

, This person is responsible to decide on set list changes, and to let everyone know about the changes in plenty of time for the players to be prepared (guitar change? patch changes on the vocal effects unit?).

,, Practice keeping a positive attitude on your face while you play music - no matter who missed a spot, blew a chord change, or plain forgot where they were - THE SHOW MUST GO ON (there is a reason this phrase has been handed down through the centuries by other entertainers). The bass and drums should never stop when there has been a flub - ever. Practice this failure situation so it does not surprise you or piss you off - make it look like it's part of the show. You are the only ones who need to know what happened.

Create a legend for your stage plot.,
Draw Stations.,
Within each outline fill in the requirements of each band member.,
Repeat for each band member.

,
Count everything.",How to Draw a Stage Plot for a Band," You will be using symbols to indicate vocal mics from instrument mics, DI boxes, monitors etc. Both you and whomever is reading your stage plot need to know what all of these symbols mean. There are no official standards for stage plot symbols.;
, Outline, in pencil, the general area where each band member normally sets up. Keep in mind that a stage plot should be drawn from the audience point of view looking at the stage NOT from the band's point of view as this is likely to confuse the sound tech.

, Supposing that you have a keyboard player in your band who sets up down-stage-right plays an electronic piano and a synthesizer and sings some backup vocals, you should indicate in the lower left hand side of the stage plot a vocal mic, two DI boxes, three electrical outlets, a keyboard amp and a monitor


NOTE: it's a good idea to specify that of these two DI boxes one is for the synthesizer and one is for the piano

,, Once you have everybody's stuff on your stage plot you are in a position to know how many vocal mics you are going to need in total, how many DI boxes, how many monitor mixes and so on. It is good to list each of these as well as a total channel count at the bottom of the stage plot so that anybody looking at it can quickly determine what size of mixer you require, how many microphones, DI Boxes etc. they will need to provide.

Consider similar band’s logos.,
Research commercially successful logos.,
Ask your community.,
Decide what design elements would fit your band.,
Consider your band’s current status.",How to Design a Band Logo1," Look at other bands logos for inspiration. This will (hopefully) give you an idea of what you want. Don't copy a logo and try to pass it off as your design. Consider bands that play a similar style of music. If you play in a heavy metal band, don’t look at country bands for inspiration.


You might find common themes that you could translate into a logo of your own. For example, many hard rock bands uses icons like a sword, skull, snake, and heart.;
, Knowing commercial logos will help you design a logo for your band. Look at popular brands like Apple, IBM, CBS, and other similar companies for research. You can take design traits from corporate logos and apply them to your design.Be careful not to borrow too much from a corporate logo and risk infringing on a trademark.

, You’ll be surprised by the amount of feedback you can receive from asking around. People in your music scene and community have opinions and knowledge of what works. Tell them the name of your band and describe the sound of your band. Make a post on your Facebook page, asking for advice and thoughts for a band logo.


Explain the sound of the music and ask if any images or ideas come up. You never know what people might think of.You could even try to get advice from local designers.

, Some bands simply use their name in an interesting font as their logo. Other bands abbreviate their name, and some just use an image for their logo.


Examples of bands that use their name as the logo are Metallica, AC/DC, and Anthrax.
Examples of bands that use an image without any words are The Rolling Stones, Weezer, and The Grateful Dead.

, A good band logo can be a great marketing tool for bands who haven't yet reached a larger audience. Design a logo that appeals to your potential fan base and the logo could help you reach those fans.

",How to Form a Rock Band," You may never get off the ground famous-wise but you can still enjoy the experience and learn a great deal. Be in this because you love music, love rock and want to experience the camaraderie of playing with mates who also love the same things as you. If anything else comes of it, that's a bonus but for now, enjoy it for what it is––experimentation and a fun hobby to share with friends.
, Realize that fame is not the key to success (and definitely shouldn't come before learning how to be really good at what you do). Don't get your expectations too high, chances are, you won't become that famous. You're doing this for the sake of music, not profit. The problem with doing it for fame is that you might focus more on image than substance, and that's the killer for any music.

, This applies to basically anyone who does not know vocals or how to read music (You need to know how to write music to start a band).


Grab an instrument that suits the genre you want to play. This can be Guitar, Drums, your voice, any possible thing can be one... Learn the instrument you picked. Be able to tune it in-and-out. Practice a bit and get to know your equipment.







, Not everyone can do this but if you can, hone it. This will come in handy later.

, These include amplifiers, software, guitar plugs, etc..

, Once you've run out of friends to choose from, look for other players from a wider pool of potential band members. For example, there are some socializing websites that are devoted mainly for to find people just like you.

, You can advertise on schools, community centers, libraries, anywhere you want. But remember to ask the owners of the establishment first. Mention on the advertisement that you need a guitar player, a base player, a drummer, a manager, and an electronics person.

, You don't want Danny from down the block trying to ""Judas"" by Lady Gaga with the palms of his hands. No, you need someone experienced with talent. Have you ever seen those cartoons where kids try to start rock bands but they all suck? Yeah, you don't want that. So have try outs in your basement or local community centers to make sure people actually can play.

, Also determine the parts for the members who are now part of the band, and the genre.

, You will need about six to seven songs, and it's fine if you have more. This way, you can perform at clubs, pubs, or wherever you please without having to be bothered by a lack of repertoire or someone complaining that they've heard it all before.

, Before actually recording anything, you need to rehearse the songs you've made. Keep playing until you're perfect. No body can make mistakes. You all need to work on one accord.


Jam practice a lot. You must practice to know your instrument and to sync in more with your band. Watch the main guitarist or singer for cues and entrances/exits on your part(s).






Keep practicing throughout your rock band hobby or career. Although you may think, ""Well I'm already in a band I don't need to practice anymore.."" Wrong. You must practice to get better with your crew/band and to discover new creative ways to extend your band's talents and music.







, Several people do this, and several people have become famous this way. You need to start YouTube, Google +, Facebook, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Twitter, and Tumblr accounts.

, Also hire (or appoint) a web designer for a website or a site on any socializing sites.


Get a clued-in sibling to do an internship for your band. Your sibling gets the experience and you get the scheduling and management needed. Win-win all around.

, Follow the steps in the ""How to Make a Demo CD"" guide. Use these steps, but instead of sending it to record companies, upload the music to your website. This is where your electronics guy/girl comes in.

, Instead, send it to record companies. Try local ones, but also try ones that are maybe a state or two away. Look at the article mentioned in the beginning for help. Both your tech and manager should be in on this one.

, This is where your manager comes in. Tell him/her that you're ready to put on shows. Tell them to call local restaurants, pubs, etc., to see if they're looking for some entertainment. Tell your manager to send your EP along with it. Remember to play some of your songs along with covers of other songs. Don't be afraid to interact with the audience. Do everything your favorite rockers do. Get your crowd rallied up!


Jam in a place with some vented areas so that the sound isn't trapped. If it is, people won't hear you.







, Just keep sending out your demo, making EPs, and performing concerts. Each tour should become bigger and bigger; because you want to spread your name further and further. (This step itself can take months, even years)

, Interstate buses will become your best bet for long distance gigs. If you don't have any cars, then Greyhound is your best bet. Your drummer can't take his/her kit (obviously). You need to make sure he/she knows and understands that.

, Everyone should know how to pull their weight when traveling. For example, your electronics player should know how to plug the laptop with the drum samples into the amplifier. If he/she doesn't, he/she needs to learn. Your electronics person should record every concert you have and upload it to your websites., This is your ""major tour"". Performing in two major cities really does something. You might see an increase of two to four hundred fans. That's really something. Most bands would kill for that.

,, Battle of the Bands, etc., you know, things like that. Always search for things like this, to promote your band.

, This is your bands first album! You've made it this far! Give yourself a pat on the back.

, You need people with home studios, and people who really know their stuff. Your record company will give you a DJ/mixer to help. Your record company will pay some of the cost. So dig into your pockets and get some of that EP/tour money out.

, This is how your record company makes money, so don't be surprised if they take 45% of your profit. Just enjoy the fact that you have creative freedom and have fun (You plan the events). Some record companies will pay for your hotel, some your airfare. What I'm saying here is, don't go bankrupt with your tour. If you can only afford to perform at 5 cities around your country, that's fine. Remind yourself that the manager is the one that manages finances/tour. So chill, and let him/her handle it.

, This is what every band does. Keep doing this, and you might hit the big time.

Apply.,
Be patient.",How to Get an Agent for Your Band," Offer to play (for free) at benefits, auctions, fairs, wherever there is a public audience. Keep an eye out for talent shows, too; agents are often looking for a band to represent. This doesn't necessarily ensure publicity and an agent, but it will definitely help.;
, Go on their website (if they don't have one, they're usually not even worth their representation) and find information about auditioning for an agent.

, You may have to send in a recording or audition tape. You may even perform live at their studio. Check or call about what you need to bring.

, Don't sit by the phone waiting. This may be the toughest part. Even if you think they've forgotten about you (they haven't!) wait a few weeks before you call again.

Draw several ideas.,
Revise your favorite designs.,
Show your friends or bandmates.,
Continue with your revisions.",How to Design a Band Logo2," Begin brainstorming with your pencil on paper. It is good to imagine words and images, but the quickest results occur once you put those ideas out onto paper. Use a sketchbook or blank notebook, and start drawing several different ideas.


They key to designing something in the beginning is to give yourself plenty of options.
The best way to go about these sketches is to get as many out as you can.
Don’t worry as much about the quality of the logo. You will be spending plenty of time refining and expanding the designs you’re happy with., Consult with your bandmates to choose a handful of your favorite designs. Try to narrow your selection down to five or six logos. If it helps you, cut each design out and lay them out next to each other. Now create variations of each design. Modify the original design in some way, for example, try to make the logo more simple and stripped down. Try to keep a balanced weight for each design in regards to graphics, color, and size.Use one of the revisions to redraw the original design into a cleaner logo.
If the design has a mixture of words and images, try strip the design of one of these features.
The more ideas you throw out, the more likely your band will agree on one.
Keep every sketch and design, even if you aren't sold on one.

, Spend a while brainstorming with your bandmates and trusted friends about the designs. Take any feedback somebody has seriously. Have each member choose their favorite out of the whole series of designs. Isolate each design that was chosen as a favorite from the band.


Line up the chosen designs and have a vote if anybody likes somebody else’s choice more than theirs.
Hopefully some of your band members will discuss what they like or dislike about your designs. Ask them what works if they don’t bring it up.

, Once you’ve narrowed your designs to about 3 or 4, you should continue modifying and revising. With this round of revisions, you shouldn’t alter the design too much. Make subtle changes at this stage. For example, you could make a line thicker or skinnier. If one of the logos is in color, make it black and white.


Show your bandmates the newest revisions and gather their thoughts.
If everyone is still in disagreement, you’ll have to repeat the process and make more drastic changes to the designs."
"
Scan your logo to a computer.,
Store the scan in a photo-editing software.,
Make digital revisions.,
Publish the logo online.,
Print out the logo.",How to Design a Band Logo3," Gain access to use a scanner to upload your design onto a computer. It helps if the computer also has photo editing software, like Photoshop, but this isn’t required.


You can also go to an office supply store, like Staples, to scan your design. These stores will scan your photo to your desired quality and then store the design either on a flashdrive or in the cloud.
Scan multiple designs just in case you want to go in a different direction later down the road.

, There are several photo-editing software options that are not Photoshop, but Photoshop is the industry standard. Open the software and upload your logo into the program. Once in the program, you should save the logo.


You can download one of these free alternative softwares: GIMP, Pixlr, Paint.net, or PicMonkey.Make sure to check out each program's specifications to see if it is compatible with your machine.

, Once the image is in your editing software, you can make adjustments to the logo. Play around with filters, vary the colors, or even add text of the band’s name. It is easy to take these tools and potentially add too much to your logo. A good thing to do with the software is to remove any white space.


By deleting white space, you’ll be able to add your band’s logo to any flyer, regardless of the flyer’s color.
You can also edit and modify the quality of the image. A good image type is .tiff.

, Add the logo to your band’s web pages. Set the profile picture of your band’s social media pages as the logo. Add the logo to any upcoming show flyers. Get the word out through the internet.

, Once you and your band is completely satisfied with the band logo, you can begin to print the logo onto merchandise. Send in the logo to a local print store to get t-shirts created. Add the logo to your newest album. The best place to put a band logo is on the back of an album. Another idea is to use the logo as an album cover.


The options are limitless once you have a logo.
The key is to not change the logo or the name of your band. If you change something, the logo won’t be as effective.
You can also print out the logo onto pins and stickers."

Fix your band.,
The first thing you can do to accomplish that is to play covers on popular songs that fit the genres your band plays.,
Start to put your own little twist on popular songs.,
Start to improve your dance moves.,
Advertise your band.,
Start small.,
When in doubt, Google it.,
Pull out your family tree.,
Go to school.,
When in doubt, go on Craigslist.",How to Book Gigs for a Band," There are a lot of nobody bands out there and anyone can hire one to play a few Katy Perry covers at their baby shower for four bucks an hour. If you want your band to be sought out for gigs, you need to be worthy of that.;
, Sorry, but wait till the record deal to play your own songs.

, For example, you can use an electric guitar to play Taylor Swift songs, you can go on YouTube and search for Mash Ups or Remixes for your popular songs, or you can use the power of harmony to make Beyonce's Halo something angels cry about.

, Good dancing can make anyone book you for a gig. Another way you can put a twist on popular songs is by playing pop songs with a piano, use DJ equipment to put special effects on your songs, or mash the song up with a song with a similar beat. For example, Adele's Rolling in the Deep played to Avril Lavigne's Smile (instrumental) sounds unforgettable. Search Smile and Rolling in the Deep mash-up on YouTube. Today, DJ effects can be found for download, free, online.

, You can create a website where you play original songs and covers. Domain names cost about 5 bucks to 30 bucks a month. You can also host a radio show where you play covers and original songs. You can do this on websites like Spreaker. You can decorate fliers and tape them in places where music is played often, like Radio Shack or parks where free concerts are hosted.

, Yes, there will be ""Oh my god, why did I book my band there?"" gigs you will play. All of theses will promote your band's popularity. You can ask you parents and your friend's parents if they or there friends are having a wedding, a baby shower, a party, a birthday or any event that might need music. You can hand out CDs where you play music for every occasion, just so they know that you're capable of playing music that fits their event. Make sure you charge a small amount, nothing over eighty dollars. Its not like you'll lose money. This way, you'll have a little pocket money for everyone and your band gets free advertising.

, Search for talent competitions. If you win, there might be cash prizes or even a record deal involved. See if any local schools are having dances, assemblies, or sports days where they might need any budget music. Go around to local parks that get a lot of people, and ask them if there are any upcoming events where they need free music. Sorry, but you can't go up to people, ask to play at their park, ask them to pay you, and expect them to do so., See if any of your relatives own restaurants or businesses that might need live music. Put up a low price and as they get to know you, you may increase your price.

, School is cool. Go to your school or college and ask them if there are any upcoming events that need a good band. If not, request that they start a talent show. Then, you can play your music, give students your websites and get free advertising. You can also go to colleges. Colleges often have their own radio shows students listen to, and you can ask them to listen to your demo. You can also see if they have any events that need music.

, Search Music Needed in Talent Gigs. You can also search band needed, musician needed, singer needed or similar options in the same category.

How much do you need to spend to secure the venue, the house crew, bartenders, door staff, and other crew for the show? How much can you reasonably expect to make in ticket sales? Before you look for bands, answer these questions.


Most bigger touring bands require a guaranteed fee for appearing, in addition to or in lieu of a share of the ticket take at the door. That means if you book a big band and nobody buys tickets, you'll still owe a large fee.Lots of small acoustic acts can be booked for relatively cheaply, for between $750-1200, while larger bands will command guarantees in excess of $2500+ for several hours of entertainment.;
, When you're booking a band to play at your event, festival, or venue, you need to pick an appropriate band for the job. Who will you realistically get people in your area to pay good money to come see? Or, who will your set audience want to watch perform?


Sometimes the audience will be set, in the event of a wedding or other gathering, while other times you'll have a variable audience and the act you bring in will attract different people to come.
Be realistic. Are you going to be able to get a Scandinavian death metal/bluegrass band to fill a big venue gig in the middle of rural Iowa? Don't spend your money stupidly if you can't fill the space.

, Who would you like to get to play your venue or event? Even if you're hiring a band to play your wedding, you don't have to hire a ""wedding band."" You might be surprised at what's available to you with the right budget. If you want to get your favorite local rock band to play, they'll probably do it for the right price.


Look up the schedules of touring bands on Bandcamp, or their personal websites. Find out if they'll be in the area when you're looking to book. Listen to sound clips and look up video to see who would be appropriate.
Think locally, as well. Local bands often bring a bigger crowd and command lower guaranteed appearance fees. What bands in the area could you book for less?

, When you find a band you're interested in that's available when you need a booking, it's time to reach out and inquire about their rates, packages, and fees.


The internet is a great place to start. You can place an advertisement on Craigslist or reach out to bands on Facebook. Reverbnation.com is a wonderful resource to find local bands. It offers a search engine to narrow by genre and location.Often times the band will also have music on the site so that you can listen to a sample. If the band has been successful in setting up a Reverbnation account, they should have contact info or a link to their official webpage.

, When you find a band you'd like to book, reach out online or by calling them on the phone. Tell them about your event or venue, the date you'd like to book the band, and find out about their guarantee and other associated fees.


If you're hiring a bigger act or a touring band for a venue, you'll usually need to get in touch with the band's management or booking agent. This information is typically available on artists' websites, under the ""Contact"" tab.
If you need a band to perform at an event, but don't much care who or what kind of music is involved, the best way to hire is to get in touch with a talent agency in your area. These agencies will help you get in touch with bands in the area, or bands coming through the area, which will be appropriate for your event or venue.

, When you get in touch, you need to provide information about the show you're putting on. Give them a detailed picture of what you're doing, what you want, and what's available at the venue.


Be specific. What is your venue like? Do you have sound equipment available? Lighting? Will there be someone there to run sound? How long does the band need to play? Will there be accommodations available after the show?

, Before you book a band, you need to make sure you have a place for that band to play. It's bad form to book a band before you've made sure there will be an appropriate venue to showcase that band.


When you reach out to the band, make sure to provide a detailed list of the sound equipment available at the venue, and find out what type of rig the band will come with. You'll need to prepare much differently for a bluegrass band than for a death metal act.
If you want to know more about renting out a venue for an event, read this article.

, Depending on the size of the act you're booking, some bands will furnish these for the performance, while others will operate on a verbal agreement. It's important to get your agreement laid down in writing, for reasons of liability and payment.


Talk to a lawyer about writing up a unique contract that you can use for all bands you hire, or use a template. You can find one by clicking here.Verbal contracts mean nothing if you're selling tickets to get a band to appear. A local open-mic gig is one thing, but if you're trying to get a band to show up for a guaranteed fee and a door agreement, you'll want it in writing. Be professional.

, How much money do you need to make to come out ahead at the end of the night? How much will people be willing to spend to see a band? You might be able to bring a great act into town, but if you're charging $75 a ticket, it might be hard to get people to come out.

, Depending on your situation, you'll probably need to provide someone to help run sound at the venue. Venues typically do not provide live sound technicians if you're renting them out, and bands should never have to run their own sound. This is an essential part of putting on a successful show.


Live sound technicians can be hired from local sound studios, and venues will often have contact information for getting in touch if necessary.

, If you're putting on a big show, you'll usually want to get more than just the headliner to play. This helps to build up a crowd, because local bands will bring people to the show, while it also gives people more for their money.


If the headliner doesn't request a cut of the door, give it to the opening bands. This gives them incentive to bring people out to the show. The more people they bring, the bigger their cut.
Some touring bands will bring supporting acts along with them. Make sure you find out and get in touch with those bands as well.

, Some venues will furnish security, bartenders, and other staff, while you'll need to provide it at others. In generally, you'll need at least a few people to run security, someone to man the door, and wait staff if you're serving drinks or food at the venue.

, For bigger bands, you'll need to provide food and other accommodations. Generally, this information will be provided on a tour rider, along with other scheduling information and backstage requirements for the band's appearance fee. Get in touch and get the rider, then provide the requested items, or negotiate other options.


Most bands don't have elaborate backstage demands, some infamous examples notwithstanding. For most bands, some bottled water, some snack food, a couple free drinks at the bar, and a place to relax backstage is perfectly fine.

, As the person booking the band, you're the one responsible for getting people in the seats. You've got to start promoting your show several weeks, or even months, ahead of time.


Get in touch with local radio stations to buy time for promoting the show. Print up flyers and paste them around town in local business windows. Get the word out.
Promote the show online as well. Blast out reminders to your email list, and post about the show on Facebook. Keep in the people's ear.

, If people wait to buy tickets, they'll often decide to not come at all when the day of the show rolls around. If someone has a ticket in hand, however, those plans are concrete. You want to sell tickets, which means you need to encourage people to buy them. Now.


Offer a discount, and make tickets more expensive the day of the show. Offer other pricing bonuses, if necessary, just get the tickets sold.

, One of the best ways to sell tickets is to make them available at a variety of locations. Local record stores, music shops, and other like-minded venues are great places to pick up tickets. You can advertise the show at all those locations, and give other people a reason to promote the show. If people come into their store, they're more likely to buy tickets.

, The last thing you want is for a band to show up at some venue with no idea where to go, what to do, or who to talk to. Be in touch, and be there, ready to help out and to answer questions. A good show depends upon timely and appropriate management.


Help pack in and out if you want to get a reputation as a solid promoter. If you're out there at the van, lugging amps? That band will put in a good word for your venue.

, The day of the show, make sure everything is ready for the band when they arrive. Whatever you've agreed upon, provide in the backstage area, and work with the band to find out about additional things they may need. Power strips, water, any kind of last-minute things that might come up will be your job to take care of.


Gives bands some privacy. Touring is rough. Most bands just want to be left alone for a couple hours, shower, get something to eat, and charge their phones.

Manage your act.",How to Become a Band Manager," The first step to becoming a manager is becoming knowledgeable on all things ""music industry."" You will be in charge of publicity, label relations, publishing relations, venue or agent relations, and all other aspect of the acts career. You can have all the drive, passion, and street smarts in the world, without knowledge of the Industry you work in, you and your act won't get far. Check the tips section for some good learning resources.;
, Come up with a name for your management company and create a business card. Business cards help to give you legitimacy. Create a MySpace page or a website (if you have the funds) for your company and link to it on your business card. Write a Mission Statement and post it on your site.

, This can be difficult and easy. It all depends on where you are, how hard you search, and where you look. Go to local shows, when you find an act wait till the show is over and give them your card. Don't be pushy or arrogant. Simply offer them your admiration and let them know that you would love to chat. (See First Impressions in the Tips section).


Find an act at local clubs or venues. Go and watch as many shows as you can.
Find an act online using bandFIND.com's manager ad listings. It specializes is connecting the music industry and the artists.

, Don't settle for just any musical act because it's the managers passion for the act that drives and propels the artist or band's career. It can take a while to generate income since you only make a cut of what the artist makes. You must believe in the act you represent or you won't get far.

, After you find the act you want to represent, send them a follow up email or Myspace message. Keep it short and sweet. Don't tell them you want to rep them just yet. Simply, set up a meeting and let them know you'd like to chat about their career and their goals.

, Dress up like a manager would and buy the act lunch. Over lunch ask them questions about their goals and about their current career circumstances. Make sure you have studied up on the industry and on the act, so you can chime in occasionally and let them know how you can help.

, So now you're a creative manager. You are now in charge of making sure that the act succeeds. To kick start this process there are a few items that need your immediate attention.


Artist/band design branding. Make sure the band's image is expressed in their design work. This image will become the artists brand. It will help to sell them to the Industry and the fans. (Not to be confused with selling out.) You are a ""manager"" which means that you are a sales man. Every act needs a logo, a few t-shirt designs, and a custom designed Myspace page. A good design can cost a bit, however, it's a crucial part of the band process. IAMwe design is a fairly inexpensive design service that specializes in music design. It's very important to package your act for success and the design process is a crucial piece of that.
Photos for the Act. Professional photos go a long way. Photos can make or break any band or artist. You need a few shots. A head shot, personality shot, sexy shot, live shot, and a few others.
The Act's Press Kit. A press kit is the Music Industry's standard for an artist or band's Resume. It should contain photos, music samples, press releases, press clippings (Quotes from previous press coverage), Biographies, and any other media you may have. It needs to be in a folder with the bands logo on the outside. Your contact info should be clearly found somewhere in the kit. You also need to copy the info from this kit to an online EPK (Electronic Press Kit). Sonic Bids is the current Industry standard.
The Act's web presence. Sign your act up for all of the major web 2.0 music services and promote them. These include Myspace, iLike, reverbnation, bandFIND.com, and Facebook among others. Use them all. They all offer their own services and opportunities.

Get online.",How to Get Gigs for Your Band," A demo is instrumental in getting you gigs. These days, a demo ""tape"" is usually a CD, and it's sometimes just a website with your songs on it. How many songs you include really depends on how many you have: you could have a whole album's worth or as few as three or four. Since a demo generally isn't for sale, you can feel free to include covers as well as original material. While a well-recorded demo is better than a poorly-recorded one, a demo doesn't have to be ""radio-ready."" In fact, the recording quality can be pretty rough as long as the quality of your songwriting and musicianship isn't, and as long as the demo gives the listener a good idea of what you play and how well you play it. You can record demos on a home studio, your PC, a digital recorder, or even a tape recorder. Make sure the vocals are clearly audible in the music as well. This could mean setting the vocals up a few extra notches that you normally wouldn't. Anyone listening to your music (especially if you plan on passing the music on to label execs) will want to hear what is being said in your song.;
, Venue managers and booking agents usually receive a lot of demos, and it's easy to get them all mixed up. Even if someone likes your demo, they won't be able to book you if they can't figure out who you are, so be sure to write or print your band's name and contact information directly on the CD, as well as on the case or sleeve.

, At its simplest, a press kit may just be a single sheet of paper; a more lavish press kit may be a small booklet. Your press kit will depend on your budget and how much you really have to say about your band. At the very least, a press kit should include your contact information and a brief biography which tells a little bit about the kind of music you play, your influences, and your experience. You should also usually include a typical set list, including originals and covers. Think of it as a resume. The venue or booking agent will want to know, quickly, what you do and where you've played before. Good pictures, if you have them, are also a nice touch, and more expensive press kits may include full-color 8X10 photos. If you have positive press clippings, definitely include them, but if not, don't worry about it.

, Bars, pubs, clubs, coffeehouses, libraries, farmers markets, fairs, festivals, house parties... No matter where you live, there are probably plenty of places to play in your town or neighborhood. If you've never gigged before, start there. Look online for potential venues. Many will show their booking policy or at least tell you how to submit your demo. Visit venues or call them and talk to the manager (or even the bartender) and ask if you can leave your demo with them. Send your demo and press kit to as many potential venues as possible.


You can send your demo out everywhere, but it can get pretty expensive, and you may find that a lot of places just won't book your kind of music. To see if a particular venue would be a good fit for you, look in your local newspaper or entertainment paper and see what venues are booking bands or artists that play the same kind of music you do (these papers and their online counterparts are also good places to find venues that are searching for performers), or just go to the venue and see for yourself. Whenever you see posters advertising a band that plays a style similar to yours, contact the venue where that band is playing.
You might want to send your demo and press kit to some booking agents. These agents--the good ones, at least--have lots of contacts in the music business and can book shows for you. In return, they get a percentage of your band's fee or they work out some other payment arrangement with you. Having an agent can open a lot of doors for you without the hassle of booking your own gigs, but it can be expensive, and some agents are better than others, so make sure you know what you're getting into.
Another option involving the Internet would be to make a MySpace page or to use a web service to house your one-sheet. These are great ways to showcase your band.

, You may have heard the saying, ""It's not what you know; it's whom you know."" Nowhere is this truer than in the entertainment business. The more contacts you have at venues and in bands, the more gigs you're likely to get. Go to shows often, and play at open mics. Make friends with other musicians, and express your interest in playing gigs. Musicians will be able to give you tips on how to get gigs; they'll be able to introduce you to agents or venue managers; and they may even ask you to play a show with them. A great way to get a gig when you're starting out is to ask a more established artist or band if you can open for them, especially if you'll do it for free. This makes their job easier, and helps you reach a larger audience.

, Having trouble getting a gig? Put on your own show. You can rent a venue or, better yet, secure one for free and plan your own show. Typically to make a self-made gig like this work, you should invite other bands--the more the merrier. This way, you can be assured a reasonably good turnout. While putting on your own show can be a great option, it can also be expensive, especially if you have to rent a venue. Watch your costs and make sure it's worth it. Another option if you are in your teens or early twenties and willing to play for free is to play at a local teen center. These are great for beginning musicians, and often also host open mic nights.

, Once you get a gig, you want to make sure people show up. Don't depend entirely on the venue to advertise for you. Put up posters, notify your fans, update your website--do whatever it takes to let people know about the concert. If people see that you can bring a crowd you're more likely to get asked back to play again, and you're more likely to get other gigs.

, Nothing will get you more gigs than taking each gig seriously and putting on great shows.


Be prepared. Of course you'll want to have your music down so you can play like a pro, but you'll also want to make sure you're ready for each gig. Find out as much as possible about the venue: how large the space is, what kind of sound system and equipment they have, whether they have a sound person, etc. This way you'll know if you need to bring your own mics or amps, for example, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect.
Be professional. Musicians have a reputation for being flaky, but you can't afford to be unprofessional until you've made it big (and even then, it could get you in trouble). Always show up for a gig, and show up on time. Answer phone calls and emails promptly. Be responsive to the concerns of the people who book you.
Have your demo and press kit available at every gig you play. If you rocked the house, someone in the audience might want to book you at their venue next. Be ready to give them a demo and press kit or at least a business card.

, Once you've gotten established locally, take the show on the road. Try to hook up a tour with another band--preferably a more established one--or just seek out venues a little bit further away from home. Once you build a regional following, you're well on your way to a record contract.

, Put your music on online networking websites like MySpace, EchoBoost.com or Purevolume. Make sure you create a good networking/friendship base that would make you look popular by ranking and listening to your music.


While the Internet may not seem like a fast way to land a local gig - if you contact music weblogs specializing in the type of music your band produces, you may find the right kind of support. If you are an unusual or new sounding act, try indie blogs first. Sometimes a regional blog or the entertainment page of a city blog will get you published. These pages have built-in fans who are looking for new material. Some of the readers have connections.

Find musicians.,
Pick your genre(s).,
Nail down your look.",How to Form a Band1," Your band could just be you, but you'll want to split fuel costs with someone when you start touring, right? Typically, for a rock band, you will need at least one guitarist, one bassist (although a band can go without bass), one keyboardist/pianist, and a drummer -- the lead singer can either play an instrument or not. Of course, this all depends on what type of band you plan to be, and what kind of music you will play. What feels right to you?


The internet is beginning to offer several places to find band mates such as Band-mix and Whosdoing. If you don't have mates that are excited to jump on board, use these resources.

Facebook works for just about everything, too.


Put up ads in cafes, music shops, and even in your car window if you're feeling gutsy. Where does your type hang out? Go there. Open mic nights? Yes. Pubs or clubs? Check.

Don't use just one; use as many as you can so your chances are better.


It helps if these musicians have some musical education. At the very least, someone needs to in order to provide a voice of reason that others may not be able to provide.
It is not always important to choose the ""best"" players. In many cases, bands of musicians who get along, are easy going, and willing to learn to play together will sound better than bands comprised of very good musicians with big egos.;
, If you can't all agree on one genre, play a bit of two (or three?) or mix together and create your own genre. Have everyone bring a mix CD of their favorite music. Listen to each one and you can get an idea of what everyone likes. All of these styles of music will influence where you record and gig as a band. If you are in a rock band then you are going to be playing very different venues to a classical music band. Does anyone have songs they've already written? Great! How does the band sound playing them?


Most importantly, pick songs you play well and that your singer sounds good singing. Try many different, simple songs in the beginning and see what fits the musicians likes and abilities.

, Now that you have your members and your genre, what's your guys' feel? What audience are you aiming for? Your look needs to be consistent and definitive across all members.


Without a certain look, it'll be harder to get gigs (and fans). Pubs will look at you and think you don't fit; clubs will look at you and think you don't fit; festivals will look at you and think you don't fit -- so pinpoint what you're going for and embrace it.

"
Consider making an inter band contract or ""band agreement."",
Find a practice space.,
Practice!,
Begin writing songs.,
Come up with a name.,
Record a demo or record.",How to Form a Band2," It is hard to get four or five musicians with individual lives to commit to each other and the musical project. One band member who is never available to rehearse or do shows can kill a band. This ""contract"" will offer some protection for what a member can do with the name, payment, ownership of songs, equipment, etc., if/when he/she leaves the band.


Solving this now will help to avoid disputes in the future. Keep in mind though, it's common that these kinds of issues will turn off potential band mates. So, make sure they are in agreement and vested before forcing a contract on them.
Have it drafted by an unbiased third party (or take templates off the Internet). If one person writes it, it may seem like a power trip. If the members agree, you may choose a single person to write the contract, but have all members agree on the rules of the contract, and be in unanimous agreement before signing.

, Will it be in someone's basement? Garage? Will you keep all of your equipment there? Get permission from whoever owns the property you and your band choose for your practice space.

, Becoming a good band takes time and effort. Practice will also ensure that you and your band-mates develop a rapport. In addition, recording time is expensive. The better practiced you are the quicker you can get in the studio and out the door. As an artist, you're probably not made of money.


A good work ethic is important to success. If someone is unwilling to practice, they may be dead weight that needs to be removed. Make practicing a routinely thing -- the band needs to be a priority if taken seriously.

, Write as many as you can, without sacrificing quality for quantity. However, know that to have a headline at a show you'll need to have a repertoire of at least 11 or 12 songs to get through your time slot.


An opening band can have as few as 4-5 songs, so try to get your very best 5 songs together and open for more known bands at first to ease into the scene.
You also may want to copyright your work. You can copyright them at copyright.gov. It is a fairly simple process. All you need to do is fill out a PA (performing rights) form (not an RA (sound recording) form; that will come later, when you sign a record deal).

, You could pick something meaningful...or just one that sounds cool. Typically the entire band will decide on the name. The best names are usually short and easy to read and spell; that way it's easy to remember. It's called branding! On another note, do NOT use a name that is already trademarked, unless you plan on being a tribute band.


Do research on other bands. If you're a band based out of Seattle by the name of ""Hockey Scientists"" and there's a band in Portland called ""Golf Doctors,"" you may want to go another direction.
If you really get stuck on a name, have everyone come up with 5 adjectives and 5 nouns, then try to agree on a band name using one of each.

, This will be your best piece of promotional material. It can be sold at shows, used to get record deals, agents, managers, etc., and used to promote to fans online.


As always, utilize Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites, too.
Consider recording a small snippet of a few songs to send to bar managers and the like. You'll be able to shoot them a short email telling them you'd love to play at their venue -- and for thirty seconds of their time and the click of a button, they can hear your sound. Foot in the door!

"
"
Start searching for gigs.,
Buy equipment.,
Spread the word.,
Start a mailing list to reach other people.,
Put a video of your band on YouTube.,
Look for accountants, managers, and other professionals you may need in the future.,
Don't get your hopes up too high, but never stop trying.,
Remember that publicity is a big thing in the music industry, and if you want to make yourselves look good, what better way to do that then through charity events.,
Don't be afraid to ask.",How to Form a Band3," You'll probably want to build a press kit. This is the music industry's standard for a resume. Venues will look at your EPK (electronic Press Kit) before deciding to book you or not. Playing live is the goal -- it will get you some cash, exposure, and it feels awesome.


For your press kit, you'll need some graphics. Does any member have any experience in graphic design? If not, does a member have a connection? You don't need a logo by any means, but you do need images for your flyers, etc., that draw people to your events.
Look into getting a photographer for a quick shoot either at rehearsal or at a gig. Your image is a quick and effective fix for a poster that has little to put on it in terms of graphics.

, There are bound to be a few places that say, ""We'd love to have you -- but we don't have a working PA system."" Well, guess what? You have your own. Problem solved. You can charge more that way, too!


While you're at it, invest in some good recording equipment if you don't have it already. The less you're at some studio's beck and call, the better.

, Make flyers and take them to your work or school and paste them in places potential fans may be (and where you are allowed to). See if you can get friends to help you with this so the work goes faster.


Look into general merchandise -- stickers, business cards, t-shirts/tank tops, decals, whatever your band might endorse. At your gigs, be sure to bring them along!

, Always promote your band online and in person. A Facebook account for your band would make it easy for people to hear samples of your music and learn who you are. Another site to consider is SoundCloud. Do your research!


You might also consider joining newer music communities, since it never hurts to get into a good site before a lot of other musicians join.

, People you may not even know will get exposure to you and, inevitably, leave their feedback. Use the best comments you receive in your advertising feeds.


You'll get some naysayers. Ignore them. It's YouTube -- the cream of humanity is not overly present on this website.

, Cultivating relationships with professionals you'll need in the future, on an ongoing basis, can make the transition from garage band to featured performer a lot easier.


Considering hiring a consultant. They can point you in directions you may not have thought of and narrow down what's feasible and what's not.
Look to friends and connections that have done it. They'll be full of invaluable price that you don't even have to pay for (well, maybe for the cost of a beer).

, It's a long way to the top if you want to rock 'n' roll. Obstacles will abound and the word ""no"" will be something you'll probably hear quite often. If you stay passionate, you'll stay happy and you'll stay going.


Make sure your heart stays in the music. If you don't feel the music, you'll never be successful. Bands are never permanent; if you feel the need to part ways, recognize it.

, It will gain you experience and also let people see what kind and thoughtful people you are, which is what everybody wants from their idols., ""If you don't ask you don't get"" is the simple way to put it. So why not look up festivals, give the manager a call or an email and say how you are really hoping to gain experience, that you'll do it for free and send him/ her a free CD. Be careful though, don't be pushy because the music scene is a very tight circle and everybody knows everybody so don't push anyone away. Other than that, go for it because you only live once and there's no harm in asking, they can only say no and if you play your cards right they might just say yes!"
,How to Form a Band4,
"
Keep it short.,
Make your name SEO friendly.,
Avoid anything with very negative connotations.,
Find a name that's fresh.,
Develop a vision for your band.",How to Find an Interesting Name for Your Band1," Think about it. How many band names do you know that are more than three words long? Not many. That’s the rule of thumb: No more than three words long. You want people to be able to spell and pronounce your name. Mostly, you just want to make sure they remember it.
Can you abbreviate your band name easily? That can be helpful for merchandising purposes. That’s one reason that Nine Inch Nails chose its name.
Consider the merchandise. Your name is going to appear on everything if you make it big, from album covers to shirts. So take that into consideration.;
, These days you want your name to be easily findable when you search it on the Internet. Names that are too common – like Girls – will be lost in search engines because there are millions of entries about other things relating to girls. Thus, your band name should not be a common word or phrase. A band called Harmony or Black won't work well because it would not come up quickly in searches. Some bands with names based on common words – like the Eagles or Kansas – were created before search engine optimization was ever a consideration. Weird spelling can trick people into searching for the wrong thing. So don't get too creative with the spelling.
Avoid special symbols like an umlaut or other coding. It can confuse search engines, and sometimes people don’t know how to type it.
Using more than one word increases the chances your name can be easily searched (if you use a single word, it needs to be something very unusual).

, You have to know how far you can push it. But, as a band named Viet Cong learned, if you push it too far, you might have trouble getting gigs. The meaning shouldn’t condone awful behavior, generally. A Scottish band once called itself Dogs Die in Hot Cars. Not the best image you want for your band, however edgy.
Avoid capitalizing on tragedies or human suffering in your band name. If your name is an expletive, some radio stations might not be able to say it.

, You want to avoid band names that are cliched now because they were trends a long time ago.


It’s passe to add a number to your name. Boys II Men seems so… not now.
Acronyms are out. Think NSYNC. Putting an exclamation point at the end of your name will date you, too.
Adding an extra “d” or “t” on the end of a name is kind of clichéd. Avoid it. Think “Ratt.”, What’s your brand? What's the vibe you’re trying to create? What’s does your band stand for? What’s your target audience? Understanding your band's essence can help you figure out a name. The band name should be consistent with your brand and genre. A country band would not want a name that sounds too punk rock, most likely. You don’t want people to be disappointed because your band name promises something you don’t deliver.
If you understand who your target consumer is, you can pick a name that appeals to that consumer. This is how the band Green Day picked its name. Green Day is a reference to marijuana smoking, and the band was trying to use an insider reference to speak to a specific audience of rebellious young people.

"
Make sure you have written at least one album.,
Save up money for a few months.,
Get a van, or a car with a trailer.,
Come up with a route or plan for your tour.,
Search for contacts in each city you hope to play in.,
Write up a contract for promoters and venues.,
Get merchandise made and CD's pressed.,
Make up a flyer for each of the shows with the venue name, show date, address and what bands are playing as well as start time and send them to the venues/band/promoters you are playing with.,
Make sure that each member has his/her equipment ready to go.,
Write an inventory of every little thing in the van, and make copies.,
Each person should pack lightly.,
Before you leave take your tour vehicle in for service.",How to Plan and Organize a Tour for Your Band," Not a couple of songs, an entire album; you'll need a lot of songs for your shows. Plan on having enough material to play a 45 minute to hour-long set, plus one or two encore numbers (think positive - you want those encores!).;
, Each person should have enough money to pay for his/her own food on the tour and the band should have some money to get started off with - you will need gas for the van, some upkeep money for oil, transmission, brake fluids, etc., and sundry money for sundry needs - maybe one of you will get a cold, and need some NyQuil or something. It's best to be prepared with more than you think you'll need.

, You need the trailer to hold your instruments and equipment. A 12 or 15-Passenger van (i.e. Chevy Express 3500) is preferable because they are spacious enough to be comfortable but also get good gas mileage for what they are. With a van you also want to get some sort of roadside assistance such as AAA or Better World Club and keep your vehicle in good working order, especially for longer tours.

, Planning which town/city you would like to play on which days. Try to plot a route that makes sense, i.e., try to make a circle rather than playing in one city one day, traveling 150 miles (240 km) to the next city the next day - and then doubling back to play back in that same starting city the day after that! Instead, try to book two shows in City #1, a day apart, and then travel on to City #2, 150 miles away. Make sure all of your band members are available during the entire time allotted.

, The best contacts are local bands that play in the area and venues. Send the band/venue/promoters in each city a message asking them to check out your band and let them know that you are interested in playing a show with them/at their venue on such and such day. You can't always get a show on the day you are looking for and sometimes have to change your route or find a different venue to play at.


Make sure you aren't playing on a night when another, bigger band is in the same town. (i.e. If you are an AC/DC tribute band don't play in Denver on the same night that AC/DC is in Denver, because no one will go to your show).
If you are trying to play in a city and there is another show of a similar genre across town that same night, try to get on that show. Do not book your own show if you're just starting out because, odds are if you are from out of town and are new to most people, there is not much demand for your show. However, if you get on a show with the biggest local band in town and you play right before them, a lot of people will be there to see the big local band and will, consequently, see you.

, You don't need to hire a lawyer to write it up, just use common sense. Make a form with spaces for venue name, address, phone number, load-in time, sound check time, show time, and pay. This works both as a means of making sure you do not get screwed over, and also is useful as an itinerary. That way you have a contact sheet for every show and know when you need to be there, and other important information.


Send these contracts through e-mail (not Myspace) or regular U.S. Mail to each venue or promoter you have arranged a show with. Have them fill it out and send it back. Keep all of the forms they send back for use as an itinerary and also to make sure things go the way they were agreed on.
Odds are that starting out, you will have shows canceled mid tour, have promoters ""forget"" to pay you and other things like that, and they are honestly nearly unavoidable. It happens to almost everyone so don't let it get you down (that's why you need to take more money than you think you'll need). A contract will, however, help to deter some promoters from just flat out being flaky on you.

, If you only have a demo or a three song ""EP"" you can still take and get them pressed and labeled packaged inexpensively. You can also do it yourself; it doesn't really matter, just as long as you have them available to sell/give out on tour. If someone hears your band and likes it but can't get a CD, odds are they will not remember you. Make sure to include your band name, a track listing and a website/Myspace URL so that they can find you online. If you have the money, you would be wise to come up with even just two or three simple t-shirts. Don't start out too fancy or expensive because as a small touring band, there is no guarantee people will want to buy your shirts, but having two or three different designs available for your new fans to buy helps you make extra money and is free advertisement when they wear them.

, Sometimes promoters or other bands do this for you and send the flyer to you. Either way, make sure it is up on your Myspace. If you'll be playing a large number of dates, you may want to make a template poster with a big blank spot to write in the date, time, location, and cover. Make sure your website is on the flyer, so you don't have to write it out.

, New strings and extra picks are a must for all guitars and bass. Drummers, bring extra sticks, and don't forget your drum key! Organize your equipment in your trailer in a way that keeps everything fragile (i.e. heads, drums, etc..) as low and tightly packed as possible. Road cases are great to have for literally every piece of equipment. Make sure that all of your equipment is ready to go, no broken tubes in your Triple Rectifier, no broken drum heads and the like. Do not leave home without a tuner and functioning instrument cables, there is no better way to look unprofessional than to need to borrow a tuner every night. Take extra cables and cords and check everything every day to make sure it's in good shape for your next show.

, You will be packing and unpacking your vehicle over and over, and the likelihood of missing something is pretty high when you factor in late-night exhaustion after a gig, the darkness of night and clubs, and mother nature. And that beer before the set. Make it easy on yourself, and just have a list. Make copies of the inventory, and use it as a checklist before you leave every town.

, People in bands are notoriously dirty, it's a fact of life. Bring two bags at most! A backpack with entertainment items like computers, iPods, books, and toiletries like a toothbrush, deodorant etc. which you keep in the van with you, and bring a large duffel bag or small suitcase with your clothes, which stays in the trailer or back of the van. Focus mainly on having lots of socks, underwear, and t-shirts. Shirts and pants can be worn repeatedly. If you are in a different city every day, no one is going to know you wore the same outfit the day before. Just make sure your clothes are clean - you sweat onstage because of the hot lights. Don't kid yourself that it's okay to wear a shirt you've soaked two nights in a row. Take it to a laundromat and wash it. Throw in your used underwear and socks while you're at it.

, Get the oil changed, tires checked, fluids checked, etc. It is important to keep a well maintained vehicle in order to avoid overusing your brand new AAA card!

, This is what you do when forming the band. It might not all come together immediately and band members might leave and new ones may join before you really get started.

, Talk as much as you can in the beginning so you avoid problems down the road. Don't worry to much about your band name in the beginning. The name will come to you one day so don't worry.

, Invite all your friends, family, and anyone you know to like the page. If you do this before you have any music and build a solid audience. If you do this when you finally release a song you already have a group of people you know will listen to it.

, You need to start compiling songs for your future EP or album. I recommend to start out you should record and EP. It is shorter, only about 5 or 6 songs, and it will be done quicker than a full album. If you have the money the best thing you can possibly do is go to a legit studio. Don't try to record on your own in your basement unless you have some serious skills. This will make the quality of your music come out better and will make it sound professional.

, You should release one or two singles so people understand what type of music you are and get a sense for your abilities. After that don't release any more singles until your finish your EP and release them all together.

, Play shows while you are still in the studio recording, you don't need to wait until after. Take as many shows as you feel you can whether it's a big venue or a small one. Make sure you are able to bring a solid crowd out to your shows. This will make the promoter feel confident that you can produce money for him and he will offer you bigger shows.

, Interact with the crowd, talk between songs. Advertise your band and bring a ton of energy to the stage. Make the people feel what you are doing. And enjoy every minute of it. Make sure everyone in the band is moving, head banging, and having good stage presence.

,, Have fun together and love every moment of it. Play metal is awesome so have fun with it.

Thank the drummer for their time.",How to Find a Drummer for Your Band," Often, the first step to finding a great drummer starts with getting to know other musicians in your area. Even in the most sprawling cities, the chances of meeting a musician who could refer you to an available drummer are still fairly high. Find out where local musicians spend time outside of playing shows and strike up a conversation!Keep in mind that drummers are typically in higher demand than guitarists or other musicians. Even with effective networking, it may take some time before you’ve met a good candidate.;
, One of the best ways to network with other musicians is to attend their shows. Attending shows often puts you in direct contact with several bands at once, not to mention the other local musicians who might be in the audience.


Approach bands after their set and tell them how much you liked their performance. Being appreciative and supportive is not only polite—it’s an effective networking technique. Next, ask them if they know of any available drummers. It’s that easy!
Ask the band members if they know anyone else in attendance who could help you find a drummer. Chances are, they’ve been in your shoes before and will be more than willing to connect you with someone who can help.

, Many drummers play in more than one band and often mix genres. Just because you play in a surf rock band doesn’t mean you can’t go to a jazz show to recruit a drummer. Go to shows at a wide variety of clubs and venues to give yourself as many opportunities to meet drummers as possible.

, Using sites like Craigslist can really boost your chances of finding a drummer. Musicians often patrol these sites regularly to find gigs or permanent positions. Search the Internet to find out if there are any forums or message boards that post wanted ads specifically for drummers in your area.When making your advertisement, be clear about who your ideal candidate is and what style of music they’ll be playing. Also include information about payment, time commitment, and any other helpful details., Make some paper fliers to post in different music venues around town. Distribute your fliers liberally—the more ads you have out there the more likely you are to get a response. As with networking, don’t shy away from advertising in a club just because you’re unfamiliar with it.


Always ask the management if it’s okay to post fliers at their venue. Most clubs will have a bulletin board specifically for this purpose, but it’s always a good idea to check in before you post fliers.
When posting paper advertisements, be respectful of other bands’ ads and don’t cover them up. It’s a good rule of thumb to just use one advertisement per venue to save room for other advertisements or show posters.
Many music stores also have bulletin boards where you can post advertisements.

, Your advertisement doesn’t need to be stilted and overly professional to be effective. Try to get across the notion that you take music seriously, but have a little fun with the advertisement. Consider including some pictures of the band playing shows or just goofing around. You don’t want prospective drummers to skip over your ad because it didn’t grab their attention.


Think about using brightly colored paper to make your advertisement stand out against the sea of other ads at a club or venue.

, Drummers won’t respond well to a band leader who plays hardball before getting to know them. Structure is good and shows that you’re serious about what you do, but try to create a relaxed atmosphere that puts everyone at ease. Your prospective drummer is much more likely to play their best in an environment where they feel encouraged rather than threatened., The point of an audition is to find out how your drummer fits in with the rest of your band and how adept they are at playing your style of music. Come up with some exercises that will test your drummer's skill. This could be anything from playing well known songs to having the drummer give you a short demonstration of their talents.Consider sending the drummer a link to some of your songs so they can get a feel for your style.
Get together with your band mates and write down some questions to ask the drummer during the audition.

, Make sure you're on time, and greet your prospective drummer warmly--remember, this could be your future band mate! Take some time to talk and get to know each other before moving on to the audition. Introduce the drummer to your other band mates, relax and chat for a while, then move on to the schedule you planned for the audition.


Look for things like tempo consistency and how effectively the drummer can reenter after a break. These skills are telltale signs of a drummer who has practiced and developed good habits.It’s a good idea to test your drummer’s limits and versatility, but also ask them to demonstrate any special skills they may have—you might discover they have an interesting technique you’d like to incorporate into your music., After the audition, thank the drummer for participating and let them know you’ll be in touch. You’ll want to confer with your band mates before making a final decision. It’s important to be polite and appreciative of your prospective drummer regardless of what you ultimately decide. If you focus on forging a good relationship with the drummer, they are much more likely to refer you to other musicians.Take stock of the audition before you make a decision. Was the drummer technically skilled enough? Did they arrive on time? Did they seem to get along with your other band mates?

Find a word with meaning to you.,
Use a pop culture or literary reference.,
Get inspiration from common products or things.,
Pick a random name.,
Use your own name (or your initials).,
Make up a new word.",How to Find an Interesting Name for Your Band2," Combine it with something else, perhaps. Your favorite candy bar? The name of your girlfriend from high school? Your hometown? These are all words you could add into a band name or just use as one. Having meaning behind your brand name can be important when it comes to publicity. You want your band name to have a good story, such as Led Zeppelin has. (Keith Moon of The Who heard one of their gigs and stated that they would go over like a lead balloon- in British English, a Lead Zeppelin.) They kept the idea but changed the spelling.
Make a list of your favorite people, places, and things. Do this without thinking too hard. You may find a good band name in that list (especially if you combine a few of the words).

, These can have staying power. A famous example is the band Veruca Salt, which took its name from the book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.


Mikey Way was working in Barnes and Noble and saw the book by Irvine Welsh entitled ""Three Tales of Chemical Romance,"" then came up with My Chemical Romance. Good Charlotte also got their name from the book ""Good Charlotte."" Matthew Sanders got the name Avenged Sevenfold from the Book of Genesis in the Bible.
There was actually a band called Natalie Portman’s Shaved Head. Not surprisingly, it ended up changing its name. Naming a band after a better known celebrity is rarely a good idea; basing it on a dated reference is more problematic.
Use a song lyric. Panic At The Disco were inspired by the song ""Panic"" by Name Taken, and All Time Low got their name from the song ""Head On Collision"" by New Found Glory.

, Flowers. Food. Sewing machines. You name it. Look around the house. You’ll find a lot of common things with interesting names.


Malcolm and Angus Young from AC/DC found their band name on a sewing machine. AC/DC (Meaning: Alternating Current/Direct Current) was printed on the back. They decided to use that.
Food names can also make good band names. Think Black-eyed Peas or Red Hot Chili Peppers.

, There are different ways you can pick random names. Sometimes bands will randomly flip through a dictionary. That's what REM, The Pixies, Incubus, The Grateful Dead, Evanescence and Outkast did. Apoptygma Berzerk did as well, using two randomly found words.


Use a band name generator. Some online sites will put together random words to generate lists of potential band names for you. The downside of a name generator is that you’re not tapping into your own creativity. And your band name won’t be something with meaning.
Still, random names can generate inspired pairings. A randomly creative name might be more unique. Some of the best band names consist of putting two words together that have nothing to do with each other. Think: Pearl Jam.
You can also just brainstorm random words that you think sound cool. And then put them together. Or put them together to create a new word (like Nickelback).

, This is always a possibility, especially if your band has a front man. For example, the Dave Matthews Band is simply based on a band member’s name – and it works.


There is risk to this name choice. If your brand changes the frontman, it will be tough to continue with the same name. Van Halen is an example. The other problem with such a name is that some band members might feel left out.
If you choose your own name, you might want to add to it to make it more interesting. Or just use your last name.

, You could create a new word that is a combination of parts of other words. Perhaps this new word (or phrase) will have some kind of significant meaning to you.


Metallica is an example of a band with a name that is a made-up word. Drummer Lars Ulrich made it up while thinking about a metal magazine.
Create a new word by misspelling a common word, like Korn.
Some bands combine parts of their hometowns’ names with other pieces of words. However, you might be called out as a fake if you choose a place name from somewhere you’re not really from. A band might name itself after a neighborhood in its hometown. Examples are Soundgarden, Linkin Park, Hawthorne Heights, Alter Bridge, or Cypress Hill (misspelling is optional).

Trademark your band name.",How to Find an Interesting Name for Your Band3," It would be a nightmare to announce a band if there is another band with your name.


Some places to check include ASCAP , BMI , and BandName.com, which allows you to register a band name. Google your name. See if any other bands come up. This sounds obvious, but sometimes people forget to do it.
For inspiration, study up on the meanings behind some of the most iconic band names. , The domain name means your name is the URL before the .com. You might want to pick a different name, if you can’t make a website in your band’s exact name because the name is already taken. You can check with sites that sell domain names online. They will tell you if it's available, and the cost is not usually very high. You can find many sites online for what are called domain registrars. Having a domain name gives your site more credibility, and the name will follow you when you change hosting services. Also, purchasing your domain name stops opponents or competitors from buying and using your band's name as a domain name. , It’s a good idea to come up with more than one band name. Then, test it out!


Show the list of names to people you know from different socio-economic backgrounds, but also from your target audience.
Don’t just ask them which name they prefer; ask them what they think of when they hear each name.

, If you want to make sure someone can’t take your band name, you should trademark it. It could be a disaster if another band trademarked your name after you did it. A trademark is simply a brand name. The other band would have to prove they had the name first. Getting a federal trademark is not mandatory. Still, you should do it to avoid the hassle. If you are confused, hire a trademark attorney. You can trademark your name and learn all of the basics of trademarking through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It’s possible to apply for registration online for a few hundred dollars. The office also has a database of registered trademarks you can search. "

If in a record contract that's great !!!",How to Create an Awesome Rock Band," Drummers are hard to find; however, you can't just teach a guitarist or a bassist to play drums (they're very different instruments). If you absolutely can't find one, it might be wise to become one yourself.

, Even if you don't play guitar for the band, you'll want one to write music for and as a back-up if the guitarist forgets theirs or doesn't have one.

, Nowadays, bass players are becoming harder to find. However, if you can't find a decent bass player, get a guitarist to learn to play bass (they're very different instruments, but the bass can be played like a guitar, although it might sound differently).

, Not everyone thinks they can sing, so make sure they can sing. But of course, you need to find a good one. If someone can sing choir music, great, they will probably be able to be a rock singer, although it isn't a prerequisite. Also try to find someone who has a lot of personality. People will not be interested in a singer who never moves and never shows any emotion.

, A good techno breakdown, or choir barrage is a good addition to a song. If you can find one who can out-shred your guitarist, nab them. Keyboards add depth and an epic feel to your songs.

, If you play other peoples music you are called a cover band. Cover bands can be good, because people want to hear their favorite tunes live and won't have to spend a fortune to see the real band play it. Keeping this last point in mind, it is wise for bands who write their own songs to also learn a few popular songs because doing so will greatly improve your chances of getting gigs.

, Don't pick songs that are too old or not catchy enough.

, Most bands practice at the drummer's house because drums are big and a total pain to move around to other people's houses. If your can't practice at the drummer's house, find a band member who is willing to volunteer their garage for practice(just make sure their parents are ok with it first, if they're still living with them) There's no such thing as TOO good.

, The first thing you do will not be making a CD. People have to find out about your band and also have to like it.

Attending local shows is the best way for a band manager to find clients. Look for bars and clubs in your area that feature live music. Attend local music festivals and other outdoor events. When you find a group whose music you love, approach them and ask if they'd be interested in hiring you as a new manager.
Talk to local contacts in the entertainment business. If you know anyone involved in the local music scene, ask their opinions about local bands. This is a great way to focus your search if you're not sure where to start. They may also be able to warn you about bands with bad reputations before you invest your time to find out the hard way.
Don't forget to use social media. Use their search features to quickly find bands nearby. Many of these will even have a few songs uploaded. Give them a listen to see if they have potential. For the bands that seem interesting, follow up with a trip to their next local show.;
, When you're just starting out and don't have many contacts in the industry, you may have to take some steps to get your name out there.


Leave a flyer or business card at places musicians frequent, such as instrument shops and practice spaces.
Register accounts for your business on social media sites. Be sure to mention that you're accepting new clients.
Try to match your aesthetics to the type of group you're interested in representing. For example, if you're interested in managing country music acts, you may want to include a picture of yourself wear a typical country outfit in your promotional materials. Wear some combination of denim, flannel, leather, and/or turquoise with a Stetson hat, western shirt, bolo tie, and/or a pair of cowboy boots. Make sure it's an outfit you would normally wear to avoid looking fake or over the top.

, Don't manage a band whose music you do not personally enjoy. It's important to manage a band you can be passionate about.


Remember that that a major part of managing a band will be ""selling"" your band to other people, such as venue owners and record executives. If you genuinely love the music, you'll be better able to give a convincing sales pitch.
Your devotion to the band will show through in all aspects of your work. When you're passionate about your job, you're more motivated to do it well. Believing in your band's success will help make it happen., You may not have this option when you're first starting out, but it's generally a bad idea to go into any type of business with friends and family. Under ideal situations, there is nothing wrong with it. However, business ventures are rarely ideal. If things don't work out, these relationships run a major risk of going sour.Sometimes there are exceptions when established relationships can actually help you be a better manager. When a loved-one's career is in your hands, you might be more motivated to do the best job possible., This applies to you, the members of the band, and anyone else you'll be spending a lot of time with, such as bus drivers and roadies. For a successful business relationship, you need to click on a personal level and work well together.


In addition to initial chemistry, you may need to help resolve interpersonal conflicts as your act matures. You'll be their coach, making sure they stay productive and together., Before you start managing your band, you'll need to do some research into relevant laws where you live.


Find out which roles you can legally take on as a band manager in your state. Although you don't need any formal certification to be a ""band manager,"" some related work requires licensing. Typical examples of these are booking agent and accountant.
These laws vary greatly between countries, states, and even cities. Information about these laws can be found on government and professional organization websites. You can also talk to a local entertainment lawyer for guidance.
This step is incredibly important for securing your future success and income. If you accidentally overstep your legal role as manager, this may be used to nullify your contract., Most band managers work on commission, meaning that they take a set percentage of the band's profits. A typical commission for band managers is 20%, but established managers with proven track records sometimes ask for a higher rate.


Although not as common, some band managers charge their clients a set monthly retainer.These retainers vary widely and depend on the manager's experience, the band's income level, the services provided, and the local cost of living. This averages anywhere from $500 to $4000. If you've never managed a band before, it is probably prudent to start off much lower.
It's also common for new band managers to ""work on spec"" either for free or at reduced rates for a period of time to prove their abilities. Consider setting a specific milestone for when it will be time to renegotiate your rates. This can be a set period of time (one to three months, for example) or a level of success for your band (when they begin to gross $1000 a month).

, Once you've found a band and know what types of services you can provide, sit down with them and draw up a contract. In the contract, specify what you will do for them as a band manager and agree on what your compensation will be. Likewise, be clear about the band's own obligations.


If you're working on commission, be sure to define exactly what you're asking for a cut of. For example, if the band recorded an album before you began your partnership, are you entitled to a commission on future sales? Be sure this is clearly stated in the contract.
This step is just as important when working with friends and family as it is with relative strangers. It might seem awkward to ask a friend to sign a legally-binding agreement, but it will actually prevent a lot of awkwardness in the long run.
Remember that the contract should protect the interests of all parties involved. Human memory is fallible and miscommunication is a frequent cause of conflict. Having your expectations in writing makes them clear, explicit, and easy to refer back to., In many ways, this is your primary duty as a band manager. It is your responsibility to establish business contacts and market your band.


Examples of other professionals you are likely to deal with if your band takes off are booking agents, promoters, venue owners, record executives, lawyers, accountants, engineers, and road crews.Ask established industry contacts for recommendations. If you don't get enough leads that way, do your own research online to find professionals with good track records who you think would fit in well.
For most of these hires, it's a good idea to get the band's input. This is especially important for sound engineers and road crews who will be working with the band directly on a regular basis.

, Many band managers are always ""on call."" Business opportunities can come at unexpected times, and you'll need to be able to field calls and emails 24/7. You'll also need to be ready to take care of a crisis, no matter its size.


For example, if your lead singer ends up in the hospital the night before a show, it's your responsibility to let the venue know as soon as possible and to possibly arrange a new date for the performance., As a manager, a big part of your job will be to ""sell"" the band to other professionals and occasionally to potential fans. You are likely to be the one interfacing with media, managing interviews and pitching your band to advertising firms. In the early days while your band is relatively unknown, you may also choose to have a direct hand in marketing, possibly creating a website or designing flyers.


It's also common for a band to use a dedicated promoter instead. In this case, it will likely be your responsibility to find and vet one., As a manager, it may be your responsibility to secure work for your band. Look for venues and speak to the people there in charge of hiring live music. Negotiate the best fee for your band and have the venue agree to a rider if necessary.


In some areas, such as California, band managers cannot book concerts without a special license unless they are also a member of the band. Smaller bands can book their own shows, but you will likely need to find a booking agent to work with if your band takes off., Tour schedules can be tough to organize, as you'll need to coordinate with multiple venues to choose dates while also accounting for travel time. Additionally, even when you can't book the shows, there are many other aspects of a tour that need to be taken care of. When acting as tour manager, it will be your duty to secure transportation and book hotels in addition to everything else you normally do for local shows. Budgeting tours is an important skill you will need to develop, making sure to keep your band comfortable while also minimizing costs."

Rehearse your parts constantly: This way you can move around and do anything while still playing your instrument well.,
Move around A LOT: the crowd has paid money to be entertained, they don't pay money for a high-energy metal show to stand and watch four or five people standing still onstage.,
Use a transmitter instead of cables.,
Have confidence: It's true that for some people, the moment you walk onstage that horrible cotton-mouth kicks in and you find yourself hardly able to speak a word.,
Crowd Interaction: Is a must.,
Promote Yourself: If you can afford it, make fliers with a link to your band's website, or hand out FREE or VERY CHEAP band demo CD's.",How to Have Stage Presence for a Rock or Metal Show,";

, This way you won't get tangled in cables if you spin around.

, But trust me, after the first few notes of your first song are past, you feel immediately more confident.

, If you're not an outgoing person, this can be difficult sometimes, but talk to your crowd, get them all pumped up and make sure that they move to your music. It's no use playing heavy music, if everyone's standing staring at you: you want a moshpit, and if that means getting into the crowd and starting one yourself, then by all means do it.

, A crowd who enjoyed your show will want to take a souvenir home with them, and there's nothing better for them to take home than your music. Even better, write the link to your band page on the front of the demo CD along with a track listing.

Whether you are a guitar player, drummer, vocalist, bassist or whatever you do ...you need to be prepared so that when the time comes to join a band you will get the spot. Train your talent.;
, For your first time there, leave the gear at home and scope it out. Find out how much stage time each musician gets and whether you can sit in with other musicians or the house band. Become a regular, and get to know the other regulars. If you trained your talent like you were supposed to, people will notice you and other artists will find you.

, It acts as a great icebreaker and can open a lot of doors for you.

, Simply ""Guitar Player seeks Band"" with your phone number can work, but including your preferred style of music is even better: ""Drummer Looking for Metal Band."" You can also post an ad in the local paper and Internet classifieds (the latter usually being free; see external links).

, There are many new online services that can help you find a band. One of the best ways to find a band online is to post an ad on all of the classified ad systems you can. Don't limit yourself to just one.

, There are not many online communities just for musicians, so take full advantage of the ones out there.

, By now they've heard you play and know your style, and they've gotten to know you as a person. You've broken the ice without having to audition. Eventually a new band will form, or someone will leave an existing band, and you'll get a call. It's good to have a public artist profile ready when they do to showcase your music. The best way to do that is to simply get a myspace music profile.

There are a few measurements that you will need to take in order to get you started.Measure the circumference of your head. Use a cloth tape measure, looping it around the area of your head where a hat would rest, to get your head's circumference.
Measure the length between the tip of your nose to the back of your head. You can use a standard ruler for this.
Take a measurement between the top of your shoulder ridge and the top of your head.
Use a standard ruler to measure the width of your head. This should be the distance between your temples.
Record your measurements and use them to properly size the pieces of your helmet.

, Before you can get started building your Daft Punk helmet you will need to gather your materials. It's important that you gather all the materials from the following list as you will be making use of all of them:Metallic gold spray paint and gold vinyl sheets.
Clear acrylic globe.
Heat gun.
Something to cut with.
Battery powered rainbow Christmas lights.
LED belt buckle or name-tag
Plastic lids. For example, you can use a lid from a peanut butter jar.
Card stock or foam to build the sides of the mask.
Wood glue to make the craft foam sturdy.
Hot glue to hold things together.
1/16” aluminum flat bar for the mask's frame.
Speaker wires.
Dark smoke headlight tint-spray.

, The acrylic globe will be used to create the visor of your mask. You will need to cut the globe to a certain shape and then bend it using a heat gun. This will create the proper shape and curvature of this Daft Punk mask visor.Cut off the sides of the globe to get an 8” mask visor.
Stretch this piece using a heat gun so that it matches the shape of Guy's mask.
Spray your visor with black car window tint-spray.

, Cut out some strips of aluminum that will be used to build a basic frame for your mask. The frame won't be visible when the mask is finished. The frame is used to to hold things together while you work to build the rest of mask. You will only need two strips of aluminum to build your frame.Cut one strip for the bottom front of the frame.
Cut another strip for the top and sides of the frame.
Hold the frame together with glue.
Attach your visor to the frame with glue.
Make sure the measurements of this frame will fit the proportions of your head. The frame will be the main part that needs to fit your head.

, To build the sides of the mask you will be cutting out layers of either foam or card-stock. These layers will form the shape of the mask as well as add support and strength to the mask's structure. Take your time and cut out shapes that closely match the shape of the original helmet, gluing them together to build the sides of the mask.Cutting out the mask sides from foam can be a quick way to build the mask sides.
You can try layering card-stock to build the sides of the mask to the shape you want.
Once you have built the sides of your mask you can attach them to the frame using glue.
Add the circular jar lids to the sides of the mask to make the “ears”.

, Now that your mask is assembled you can begin to add the metallic gold color to it. You will first need to spray paint the mask before applying the metallic gold vinyl sheets.Block off your mask's visor with painter's tape to prevent the gold paint from getting on it.
Spray the mask with the gold metallic paint first. Make sure you've covered it completely.
Once painted, apply the gold vinyl to finish the metallic look.

, The lights will be added to the inside of the mask, using tape so that you can adjust them or remove them later on. You will need to add both the side lights and the front bottom “word” LED light. Keep the following tips in mind when creating your mask's lights:Rainbow Christmas lights can work for the sides. Place the lights in a column with their noses touching and hold this strip together with a tape backing.
An LED belt buckle or nametag can be used for the “word” light that will go near the mouth of your mask.
Attach the lights to the inside of your mask using tape or magnets.
Make sure your lights are all battery powered.

, Guy's mask has a bundle of wires that are visible at the back. Adding these wires will be the finishing touch on your own mask. These wires should be cut to a length that covers the back portion of the mask and can be attached using hot glue or other adhesive.These wires should lay flat against the mask.
Make sure none of the wires are overlapping each other.
Try to find wires that have a colorful outer coating.

Know about the microphones.,
Now it's time to try to play a song.,
It's time to write a song.,
After you know a few songs, try to find a place to perform.,
Over time, your band will get better.",How to Compose and Perform a Rock Song," A typical rock band consists of a drummer, a bass guitar player, a guitarist and a singer. In many cases, the singer will be playing the guitar or bass as well. You might have two guitars in your band, perhaps a keyboard player, or even a sax player. It depends on who you find and what style of music you play.;
, Make sure that they can actually play something, have a basic knowledge of musical theory, and are actually interested in playing and performing.

, Maybe a drummer, and three guitarists, and nobody sings. Do what the middle schools do: Put the worst trumpet player on tuba. In your case, you'd probably have him play bass. Bass parts are usually easier than guitar parts, so the learning curve might be easier. Also, singing comes with maturity. Most people don't want to sing because they're scared of being horrible. If they never sing, they will be horrible. It will come with practice.

, You can purchase a guitar or bass for about $100. It won't be great, but it's a start. Walmart has some, but you're better off at a music store. Drum sets can be about $200. You also need amps for everyone. They usually come in starter packs, but you can get a decent small one for $100 for guitar or bass.

, Drummers hit drums. Percussionists play drums. Get someone who has played music in the school band, a previous band, or really knows how to keep time while playing. Whoever works the percussion lays the backbeat for everyone else, so they have to be consistent.

, Mics usually go into a PA system in a concert hall or club or anywhere they have music normally. For practices, it can be a pain. It's not going to be loud enough, but plug it in to a bass amp or a stereo system that you might have for CDs. You just need the right adapter (Radioshack).

, In the beginning, try a simple jam session. Have the drummer do a simple beat, and have the bassist play quarter notes on E. Then have the guitarist strum an E chord in either quarter notes or eighth notes. If there is another guitar or whatever, have he or she solo in the pentatonic E scale. It sounds hard, but the best part is that it's very hard to be bad. Just play E G A B D E in different orders, in different rhythms. You'll get the hang of playing together in time.

, All you have to do is write a poem. It doesn't have to rhyme, though it sounds better when it does. Try to pick a topic, like running to the store or going on vacation or something. Or it could be random, and not make any sense whatsoever. Then, once you make some lyrics, come up with a simple chord progression. Many times, the 4 and 5 chords are used. For instance, if you were playing a song in G, maybe the chords would be G D A C, or 1 5 2 4. Then, try to come up with a little guitar lick or some kind or little melody to play in between the verses and chorus and stuff. This can be anything in the key of the song. A good example would be Dammit by Blink 182. Once you get the chords and the lead part down, try to organize it into a song. You can try: (Intro) (lead part) (Verse 1) (Chorus)


That is the basic part of your song. Then: (Lead Part) (Verse 2) (Chorus) (Bridge) (Chorus) (Ending) This is typical of a rock song. Once you've practiced that enough, try to make a few more songs and learn some easy covers. If your band members take lessons, have them ask their teachers for advice.

, Your first performance should be in front of people you know, and a small group. From there, move on to“Battle of the Bands” competitions. You don't have to win, just get experience and let people know you exist. Try to book yourself in local restaurants that feature bands.

, You'll lose members, and gain new ones. You'll upgrade your equipment. You might get a PA and massive amps. You might get a record deal and go on tour. You never know. But you have to start somewhere.

Practice!,
Know where you fit in the band.,
Learn to play secondary instruments like keyboards, guitar, or percussion instruments, or simply do backup vocals.,
Have a personality.,
Listen to bands with excellent bassists, and not just those that play your style of music.",How to Be a Bass Player in a Band," You want to be good at your instrument! A bad bassist is the kind other band members will hold in contempt, but an excellent bassist is the kind who will impress anyone who hears the band and will receive generous amounts of solo time. (A generous amount of bass solo time is anything above five seconds of a song) Be sure to practice:


as often as possible
many different styles
various playing techniques (slapping, fingering style, picking, etc.)
writing
improv, especially short fills or embellishments
playing by ear
creativity (which goes hand-in-hand with improvisation);
, Realize that the bass is not usually a lead instrument and embrace the fact! The greatest bass lines can sometimes be the simplest, depending on the song. If you are upset because the bassline in a cover your band is performing is comprised of long strings of the same note, understand that you are probably playing a punk, emo, or mainstream rock song and the guitarist's long strings of power chords aren't much more exciting to play. When songwriting, don't go to ridiculous lengths to give yourself a technically complicated part. If it fits, great! If not, just make it simpler until it flows with the rest of the band.

, That way, you can still be part of the performance in a song that simply doesn't need a bass. An acoustic number, for example.

, This is especially important for live playing. If you have as much stage presence as the singer and guitarist, you will be paid at least as much attention as the guitarist. (Give the singer a break, they are the front person!) High-five any fans that hold their hands up to the stage, dance around, be fun to watch! It helps to be noticed if your appearance is radically different from the other members, but don't change your personality! Also be original!

, Listening to other genres can expose you to new styles that will turn your band's music into something unique! (ex. a country band with a bassist who plays with a funk style) Some good bands to listen to are:


Rush
Red Hot Chili Peppers
Reel Big Fish
Led Zeppelin
Black Sabbath
The Beatles
Primus
Tool (especially 1996-present)
Muse
System of a Down
Weather Report
Deftones

",How to Become a Rockstar and Become Popular in Middle School," If you can't play any instrument, then how are you going to rock out?;
, Pick some of your more loyal friends to be in your band, and if you don't fill in all the slots (lead guitar, bass guitar, singer, drummer keyboard and rhythm guitars are opt), pick someone you know. Just make sure that they are good at their instrument.

, The logo will be important for merchandising, assuming you get to that point.

, If you can take a white shirt and put your band name and logo on it, that'd be sweet.

, This can be at school, a cafe, or anywhere you think teenagers hang out.

, After playing a few gigs, you should have a relatively large fan base; make sure you're nice to all of them, and don't let it get to your head.

If your artist has an official fan club, join it. Membership in the fan club will give you a leg up on casual fans.

Listen to radio stations that play the artist's music. Often, radio stations will have contests to win backstage passes. If passes for your artist are up for grabs, do everything you can to win!
Attend meet-and-greets. Artists sometimes will stick around before or after shows to sign autographs and meet with fans. This is the perfect chance to introduce yourself, but try not to give the impression that you're insane! Stalkers get barred from backstage events.
Watch your artist's shows from the front row. You have a much better chance of catching your artist's attention in the front row, especially if the show is a smaller, intimate one. If they like you, they might even let you up on stage! Don't heckle or distract them and never climb onstage without being invited. It's a good way to get tackled by a bouncer. Rock stars have been known to react poorly to people who don't respect their personal space.

, You eventually want to make the jump from being ""just another fan"" to being on first name basis with the band. If the band sees in you in the front row at every show, and backstage before every concert, they'll take notice. Familiar faces can get invited to after parties and more - perfect opportunities for getting to know the band and (almost as importantly) the people close to them.


Now's your chance to network - make friends with everyone in the music industry you're introduced to. Inside connections can help you get closer to any artists you're dying to meet.
One great way to gain access to the band is to work for them. Touring musicians can have large support crews - they'll need people to carry heavy equipment, set up lights, manage their sound levels, coordinate their costumes, etc. If you can learn a skill that's useful to a touring band, you'll be able to hang out with your idols and get paid for it!

You don't even have to be a roadie to get access to the band - they need people to do their taxes, too! Accountants, managers, booking agents, and other professional positions all have access to the band.



, If you've begun to hang out with the artist and made a good impression, you can begin trying to spend time with them as friends. It's not as crazy as it seems - stars are human beings too, and humans need friends. As usual, try not to seem creepy or desperate - even music's biggest egos might be repulsed if you're too fawning. Try to play coy and maintain a little mystery! Flirt with the artist, but don't make yourself too available. Play hard to get. With any luck, you'll begin making regular appearances in the green room and at exclusive parties.


Understand the risks of hanging out with touring stars. Though many professional musicians are normal, well-adjusted people, the pressure of international fame can lead some stars to depression, substance abuse, and irrational behavior. If your new famous friends are pressuring you to do things that make you uncomfortable or seem dangerous, strongly consider re-thinking your devotion to the artist.

, Groupies who are especially close to the artist might have spots reserved for them on the tour bus. Seize this opportunity - you'll see the world for free! You'll also get to enjoy (or not) experiencing personal, intimate moments with your artist. Remember that roadies, managers, and technicians get to travel with the band without sucking up to them first. If you have any skills a touring band might need, strongly consider working for one!


If you've made it this far, now's a good time to consider immortalizing yourself through their music! Write a song for them or convince them to write one about you. Famous musicians' muses can be almost as iconic as the musician themselves (see: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Sid and Nancy, etc.)!

, This is it - the secret dream of any groupie. If you've been spending serious time with your artist, you might be able to become their significant other (or one of several significant others.) This is as close as a groupie can be to an artist, but relationships with famous artists carry unique stresses, like:


Infidelity. Famous artists are notorious cheaters. If the thought of your idol fooling around with other fans infuriates you, you should check your expectations and proceed only if you're sure he or she is a straight shooter.






Tabloids. As a star's significant other, you may receive attention from the press. You might come to relish this attention, or you might hate it - either way, consider how you'll react to paparazzi before you take the plunge.
Self-destructive behavior. Some famous musicians are kind and emotionally stable. For instance, rock star Dave Grohl is frequently noted as being down-to-earth and friendly.However, if your artist is OK with having a relationship with a slavishly devoted groupie, there's a reasonable chance that he or she isn't quite so stable. As their significant other, you may be exposed to substance abuse, tremendous personal drama, sexual deviancy and/or emotional meltdowns. You've been warned!







, Artists opinions' differ on what makes a good groupie. What attracts some artists may repel others. The better you know your artist, the better you'll be able to please them. Here are just a few thoughts from the stars on what makes a great groupie:


Detroit rapper Danny Brown values dedicated groupies. Brown says a true groupie is someone who will ""a roadie or security guard"" just to get access to the artist himself.Influential Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is famous for preferring groupies with very open minds. Along with many other infamous incidents attributed to him, Page is known for once taking a bath with two groupies and four live octopuses.Pamela Des Barres, who was a groupie for Keith Moon, Mick Jagger, and other rock gods, says the groupie lifestyle takes ""a lot of heart and a lot of guts."" Des Barres says ""It's all about love. Groupies love the music, the people who make it and the energy that pours out of that amazing live experience."", The simple nature of being a groupie can feed certain obsessive personality traits. Don't let groupie-dom turn you into your artist's mindless devotee. They'll respect you more if you respect yourself and adhere to some common sense groupie rules:


Don't let the artist walk all over you. No matter how much you love an artist's music, it's never OK to let them treat you like a plaything. You're a valuable, respectable person first and a groupie second.
Don't spend beyond your means. If you work for the band or you've got a legitimate reason to travel with them, great. If not, don't waste your life savings following them across the globe. Penniless, desperate people aren't very attractive.






Don't harass the artist. Don't barge into green rooms uninvited or push your way to the front of the autograph line. Doing this virtually guarantees you won't have a personal, intimate connection with the band.






Above all, remember that the artist is just a person. No matter how talented, the artist is an imperfect human being just like you. Treat them as such. Don't worship them, even if you think they deserve it.

Keep dust off your turntable and needle.,
Operate your turntable correctly.",How to Operate a Turntable," Turntables are usually fitted with plastic dust covers to keep the components clean when not in use. If you have a hinged dust cover, you can lift the cover and then gently lower it again once the record is playing.
If your cover is not hinged, you should set it aside until you are done using the turntable. Placing it down while a record is playing can damage the player and record.;
, The platter is the circular platform which you will place your vinyl record on. Sometimes there is a second dust cover, usually made of felt, that rests over the platter.


Lift the circular felt cover off the platter and place it somewhere where it won’t attract much dust.
You can store the felt cover inside of the record’s jacket while your record is playing. Though you may have a plastic cover, it is always good to use both when not using your turntable. Using both will ensure no dust or scratches occur and damage any components.

, Some turntables will have a switch to start the rotation of the platter. Others will automatically start when the needle drops. In either case, make sure your record player isn’t spinning and the needle is up.









If you place your vinyl record onto the platter while it is spinning you risk scratching the record.

, Again, the platter is the round platform on which the vinyl record rests during play. Holding the record only along the record’s edges, lower the record onto the platter.








Place the spindle in the center of the platter through the hole in the record. Lower the record until it is resting flush on the platter.
Always hold your records by the edges and don’t touch the grooves of the record. When removing a record from the jacket, you may have to briefly grab the playing surface.
Only touch the very outer portion where the grooves are not present to pull it out. Quickly transfer your grip to along the edges. The oil from your fingers can get onto the surface of the record and affect the sound as well as attract dust and cause scratches.
The platter on most turntables will be made from metal, but should be fitted on top with a foam or rubber mat. This mat cushions the record during use, and you should never operate a turntable without a mat in place.

, Control setups will vary between turntables. But, most will have a switch that allows you to engage or disengage the motor driving the platter.









In some cases, this switch will be integrated with the speed selector; for example, the 3 switch positions may be ""off,"" ""33 rpm,"" and ""45 rpm."" In other cases, you may need to select the speed using a separate switch or by repositioning the drive belt manually.
Standard 12 inches (300 mm) records should play at “33 rpm.” On automatic turntables, the platter may be designed to start rotating when the tonearm is lifted towards the platter. In this case, you will not need to deliberately put the platter into motion.

, Many turntables will have a cueing feature that allows you to simply engage a switch that lifts the tonearm from its rest automatically. This process is called ""cueing."" Some turntable will have a cue lever which is used to raise and lower the arm.









If you don't have a cue switch, gently lift the tonearm from its rest by placing your finger underneath the handle on the head shell. Or use the cue lever.
Ensure that the cueing lever (if there is no switch), a small arm usually located at the base of your tonearm, is up. The cueing lever is what lowers and raises the tonearm. You need the cueing switch or arm to be up so that your tonearm doesn’t fall onto the vinyl when you move it from the resting position and over your record.

, The needle of the tonearm needs to be positioned directly over the outermost grooves in the record. You should see a few widely spaced grooves on the outer perimeter that indicate the area before the recording begins.









If your turntable has a cueing feature, you can gently push the tonearm into place with your fingers. It will rest above the record until you disengage the cueing switch or lever.
If your turntable has no cueing switch, you will move the tonearm over the record by using the handle on the head shell.

, The tonearm should be lowered very gently onto the outer grooves of the vinyl record. The stylus should engage the grooves with minimal popping or clicking sounds. The recording should begin shortly after the stylus is lowered.









To lower the tonearm using a cueing lever, simply disengage the switch or lever by lowering it down. The tonearm will gently lower itself and the stylus will engage the record’s grooves. To raise the tonearm, raise the cueing switch.
Without a cueing switch, you will have to manually lower the tonearm onto the record. Be as slow and steady as possible when doing this. Lowering the stylus too violently can damage both the stylus and the record.

, When you are done listening to the record, you need to lift the tonearm from the record and place it back into its resting position.









Lifting the tonearm can either be done by engaging the cueing switch or by manually and gently lifting it from the record's surface. On some fully automatic turntables, the tonearm will return to place automatically once the record is over.
Make sure that the tonearm is back in resting position before stopping the platter from spinning. The tonearm shouldn’t be resting on a stopped record. This could apply excess pressure to the grooves and cause damage.
To listen to the other side of the record, flip it over and repeat the above process. When done using the turntable, remember to replace the dust cover. Make sure the tonearm is in resting position and the platter isn’t turning. Then lift the record by the edges and flip it.

, A lot of record players require you to use a receiver to hook the turntable up to. The receiver then connects to speakers which will play the sound coming from the record.


Hooking your turntable into a receiver and then connecting the receiver to speakers is the most common setup.
If you already have a receiver and speakers for your home entertainment system, you can hook your turntable into your existing equipment. To get the sound from your turntable to come out of your speakers you will need to set your receiver on “Phono”. Some turntables will also require an external phono preamp to be hooked up. A preamp is used to help amplify the sound being created by the needle on the record’s grooves. Some receivers don’t have the necessary inputs required to effectively connect the turntable. However, many modern turntables have a built-in preamp that allows you to connect to your receiver.

, Attaching your cables correctly to your turntable and your receiver or speakers is fairly straight forward.


There are often color coded cables to help you figure out where to put a certain cable. There isn’t only one way to attach all your cables as there are many different kinds of turntables and sound systems.
Always keep your instruction manuals. Your instruction manuals for both your turntable and your sound equipment will guide you for your specific setup.
When connecting all the cables make sure that your systems are turned off and unplugged. You don’t want to risk injury to getting shocked.
Most turntables also have a small thin wire with a little crab claw-like metal tip. This wire is the “ground” wire. This wire prevents an unpleasant buzzing sound when playing. There will be a marked connection point on your stereo system, provided it can play phono. , Once it looks like your turntable and sound system is correctly hooked up, plug everything in and set your receiver to “Phono”.


The phono input is the one you need for your record to be heard. Because the sound isn’t coming from a digital source like from an iPod or CD, it is much lower.
The phono setting, along with a phono preamp, whether external or built-in, amplifies the sound.

, To prevent any scratching or muddled sounds, make sure that you always keep your needle free of dust.









The small needle at the tip of your tonearm often collects dust very easily. If your needle has a dust cap, be sure to place it on after every use.
If there is dust on your needle, you will need a stylus cleaning brush and turntable cleaning solution or rubbing alcohol. Dampen the stylus brush and gently wipe the styles from front to back. , Always take the necessary steps to operate your turntable and records correctly. Though it may take more time, it’s worth it to preserve your equipment.









Always remove and replace any dust covers before and after each use.
Don’t start spinning the platter before you place your record down. Likewise, always wait for the platter to completely stop before removing your vinyl otherwise you may scratch it.
Operate your tonearm and needle correctly. Never drop or abruptly remove the needle. Always use the cueing arm.
Don’t get your fingerprints on the surface of the records. Always hold by the edges.
Store records vertically in a dry location. Humidity and stacking records on top one another will cause records to warp. Always put a record away as soon as you are done listening.

If you are planning to mix the tracks together, it helps to choose songs of the same genre or at least of similar BPM. 120 BPM is a good starting point for beginners.;
, Do this by using the file navigation bar. You should be able to see a list of the tracks you selected in the window on the left side of your screen.

, The easiest way is to press CTRL+T with the session view open.

, Wait for the file info to load before you do anything else.

, This will bring up the waveform in the sample display window.


Confirm that the master BPM of your session is set to 120. This is the default setting, so unless you have messed with it before you should be good.







, You can either use the magnifying glass icon which appears when your cursor is placed near the top of the waveform, or the miniature diagram below the sample display window.

, These are the little yellow tabs with the numbers on them.


Make sure the first warp marker is placed right at the beginning of the first beat.
Play the beginning of the song a few times while watching the line sweep through the waveform. This will help you to associate a visual cue with the location of the first downbeat.
Locate the numbered marker that is closest to the downbeat and double click it to make it a warp marker. It should turn yellow when you do this. The number will be something like 1.1.2.
Adjust the position of the second warp marker until the number in the sample window reads 120.






Right click on the second warp marker and choose ""Warp From Here (Straight)"" from the menu that comes up. This will warp your track according to the up and down beats you have selected.






Confirm that the start and end markers are correctly placed on your track. The start markers should line up with warp marker #1 and the finish markers can go wherever you would like the track to end.







, First, enable the metronome by pressing the little square at the top left of the screen. Then press play on each track individually to see that it matches up.

,, The best way to do this with an entire DJ set is to go to the file menu and select ""Collect All And Save"". This merges your audio files into the project and saves them as one file.

, It should be just the way you left it after you finished warping all the tracks.


You might want to confirm that the tracks are properly labelled with song titles so that you can easily identify them on the fly. Color coding is also useful for this. You can edit these options when you right click on any file in the session window.







, Imagine the 1 and 2 audio channels are right and left turntables.


Put the first track in the top slot of audio channel 1, the second track in the top slot of audio channel 2, the third track in the second slot of audio channel 1, and so on.







, See that little triangle on the colored icon for the track you want to play? click it.


Turn the volume down on audio channel 2. This will ensure that the second track does not play until you are absolutely ready for it.

, The volume on audio channel 2 should still be down when you do this. Ableton will automatically match the beat if you warped your tracks correctly.


Keep an eye on the time indicator above the volume switch so you can tell how much time is left in the track you are playing.
When the time is right, gradually raise the volume on audio channel 2. The two tracks will play together for a bit, during which time you can fade out the first track as you turn the volume up on the second one.

, This will prevent you from playing it twice.


Alternately, you can drag the file into a third or fourth audio channel to signal that you have played it already.
Move the third track to the top slot in audio channel 1, and turn the channel's volume down.







, Again, it should start on the correct beat if your files are warped accordingly.


Gradually raise the volume on audio channel 1 as the second track is drawing to an end. Fade the volume out on audio channel 2 as you are doing this.







,, This should include all the warped tracks from part one.

, Select the track and press CTRL+C, or right click on the track and select ""Copy"" from the menu.

, You will need to move back and forth between arrangement and session view a lot throughout this process.


Open arrangement view. Click the top circle in the upper right hand corner of the screen. The one with the horizontal lines.
Paste the first track into audio channel 1. The pasted track will begin wherever the blinking cursor is placed. Place the cursor at the end of the first track in audio channel 2 before continuing.






Copy the second track from the session window. Click on the bottom circle at the top right of the screen to move back and forth between views.
Go back to arrangement view and paste the second track in audio channel 2 near the end of the first one. If your cursor is in the right place, it should drop there automatically.

,, You can move them back and forth until they overlap in just the right places. Complete this step for every transition in your set.


Zoom in on the first transition using the magnifying glass. This appears when you scroll over the numbers just above audio channel 1. You may also zoom in by adjusting the bar at the very top of the arrangement screen.






Select the second track and move it backwards so that it overlaps a bit with the first track. When your cursor is placed in the area between the string of numbers and the first audio channel, a speaker icon will appear. Left-click with the speaker icon to start playing audio from any point in the set. Do this often to ensure the beats are matched.







, Initiate draw mode with the little pencil button at the top of the page. This will allow you to manipulate the red volume line down the middle of each track to achieve a fading effect in your audio.


Right click with the pencil enabled to access the grid menu. Depending on how detailed you want to get with your fades, you can adjust the width of the background grid to fit your needs.

,, There are a couple of things you should do before rendering the final audio file.


Make sure your start and end punch-out points are placed accordingly. These are the little gray triangles right under the row of little numbers. Drag the first marker to the beginning of the set and the last one to the end.
Select both audio channels by clicking the name of each one with the CTRL button pressed down. You will know you did this correctly when both names become highlighted in yellow.
Go to the ""File"" menu and select ""Export"". A series of menus will follow which allow you to choose your file type and location. Select WAV from the menu, and save the file wherever you like. From here, you can upload your mix for streaming or burn it straight to a CD.

You should have at least one set of turntables, a mixer (nothing more than 8 - 12 channels), an amplifier (to amplify the sound to your loud speakers), two loud speakers and stands, a microphone for yourself and all the cables needed.,
Set the turntables on a table or surface.

,
Place the mixer adjacent and plug them both in (always remember three-prong extension cords!),
Do the same with the amplifier.

,
Take your loud speakers and set them up about five to ten feet to the right and left of your DJ booth, the should be angled towards the audience and be at the height of their ears.,
To plug in your turntable set into your mixer, use RCA (those red and white tipped cords) cables or XLR (microphone) cables (depending on the turntables, they will vary).,
Adjust the Gain (the sensitivity of the input) of that channel so it is loud enough but not clipping (being too loud) on the mixer.

,
To plug your mixer into your amp, use 1/4"" (shielded, they look like guitar cords) cable(s).,
Use two more 1/4"" shielded cables to run from your amp to your speakers.,
Turn on your equipment in this order: mixer, turntables then amp.

,
Make sure all the channels that aren't being used are muted and that everything is secure.

,
Test out your turntables, make sure everything is sounding correct.

,,

,, This is imperative.

, MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALWAYS PLUGGING FROM OUTPUT TO INPUT (and vice versa)! Plug this into your mixing board, into either the tape inputs (those RCA cords) or the XLR into a microphone channel.

,, Usually there is a ""Line Out"" or ""Main Out"" on the mixer, find one and plug one end into the mixer and the other in the back of the amp (it usually says ""Mono In"" or ""Main In"", use common sense) Again: MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALWAYS PLUGGING FROM OUTPUT TO INPUT!

, Be sure to place them out of heavy traffic of people. If necessary, duct tape them down (black duct tape is the best).


Plus your microphone in and adjust the corresponding gain.

Understand that each tour management gig will be different.",How to Become a Band Tour Manager," Many band and tour managers were once musicians themselves. If they were not, then they attended concerts and other music industry events regularly.;
, Apply for an internship or entry-level job with a music label or in music public relations. Most people start as an intern and earn their way into an entry-level job in the company.


It is not absolutely necessary to work for a music company in order to work as a band tour manager, since you can be hired directly by bands. However, it will give you important industry knowledge that will help you work with third parties, such as venues, roadies, opening acts and more.

, A tour manager is essentially an event planner who is constantly juggling events in different towns.


Consider enrolling in an arts management or music management program. Many schools in the US and Canada offer these programs, but you may need to relocate in order to take advantage of a program that you like.
Consider enrolling in an events management associate's degree program. You will need to be able to do scheduling, budgeting, travel arrangements, money management, planning and public relations in small degrees every day. If you are not good with handling money, take business courses.

, Band tour managers must be extremely social and able to field phone calls throughout the day and night. They also must be assertive to be successful.


You will be required to enforce contracts and ask for money from venues and promoters. You will also need to act in a ""parent"" role with the band, so that you can earn their respect and be an authority figure. Some ambivalent, but social, parts of the job include breaking up fights and living within a very close environment, such as a bus, with the band.

, You are more likely to earn a gig as a tour manager if you are in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, New York City or Nashville. This is only necessary when you are looking for jobs, since you will need to be on the road once you start managing tours.

, You are never too young to start making industry contacts, so introduce yourself as someone interesting in managing an upcoming tour.

, If you don't feel as though you can jump right into tour management, contact tour managers and volunteer to assist them for free. Volunteer 2 weeks to a couple of months of your time, and the extra expense may result in important contacts and valuable experience.

, Try to learn on a small, state-wide tour. Then, once you are familiar with the process, you can start moving into regional, country-wide or international tours.


Being a tour manager often includes making the travel arrangements. For this reason, it is a good idea to start where you know the best way to get a good deal and work your way into new areas. You may also need to learn about venues in promoters in different regions, which is where your music industry knowledge will come in handy.

, You will be asked to take on aspects of band management and publicity on some tours, while during others you will simply get the band from 1 place to another. Clarify what the band, the label and the manager want before you take the job, so that you have a better chance of succeeding.

However, digital controller and CDJs (CD turntables) have become increasingly popular, and many offer features that enable them to be used to scratch, create beat loops on the fly, play tracks in reverse or at very fast or slow rates, and other functions that make them great fits for turntablism.


If you don't own a turntable, buying your first can be an intimidating proposition, not to mention that to really be a turntablist, you'll need two. You can technically ""scratch"" with a single turntable, but it won't be making music. As long as you've got a direct-drive model, it should be fine for scratching. Don't break the bank.;
, Curve-adjustment allows you to control the sound switching back and forth between your turntables more easily. A good scratch mixer includes a crossfader that does not have to be exactly in the middle before the sound is crossed over into the new channel. You don't absolutely have to have one of these mixers, but they make mixing a lot easier later on when you start doing advanced techniques.

, Anti-static slipmats are essential to the scratching DJ. You want to be able to put a finger or your hand on the record and stop the record from moving without stopping the whole platter from moving.


If you have a cheaper set of turntables you may need to cut additional pieces of plastic, wax or parchment paper. Plastic carrier bags from the supermarket work really well.
You can buy a product called ""magic carpet"" that will help reduce friction. If you want to use your own slipmats or have a problem with stoppage or you can pick up a product called ""butter rugs"" and just use those as your permanent slipmat.They are the slickest slipmats available. You may still need to reduce the friction further but it depends on your taste and equipment.

, A turntablist needs an eclectic variety of vinyl records from which to build music. A turntablist is a mixmaster, using the beats from some records and sampled portions of other records to build sounds. It's a complicated collage-style way of making music that can only be accomplished with lots of practice, and lots of records.


Most scratch records have a series of samples, alternating break-beats and sound effects. Don't just buy any record you find online, it's best to listen to the records to make sure they have something on it that is usable in your practice/performance.
For DJs, non-skippable records have been designed to repeat the samples in a way that if your needle skips (as it will) you will remain on the sounds you are trying to use. If you don't have regular records, then try to wear in the record a little by finding the samples that you like and then pushing the record back and forth to get the needle and the groove.
You can use a capella records or records that you already have and try to find a sample to use, but most DJs normally end up picking up a few scratch records to use in practice and battles.

, Listen to records with an ear for little moments around which you might build a whole song. Break-beats, the moments during which all the instruments drop out and the drums remain, are commonly isolated for use as the beats in hip-hop tracks, while instrumental tracks often make good melody lines to pair them with.


Listen closely to records and stop the record when you hear something you might like to use. Go back and try to find the exact moment that sound begins.

, In the old days, DJs would take small, round stickers that teachers would use on essay papers and place the sticker directly on the record, next to the groove, just beyond the sample. This provides both a visual cue to where the sample starts, and will bump the stylus back into the groove to re-bump the sample.


Some DJs prefer not to put stickers on the vinyl itself, though it's the classic way of doing it. You can also try to mark the groove however works best for you, if you're going to tape your beats or mix them on the fly., After the sound finishes playing and then slowly bring the record backwards at close to the same speed as it played forward. It should sound like you just hit reverse on your turntable. The classic ""scratch"" sound comes from picking an appropriate blank beat, like a trumpet blast or some other long sound effect, and rocking the platter back and forth over that sound, producing the distinctive ""scratch"" sound.

, A scratch by itself would be like a movie made entirely of explosions. Cool at first? Sure. Boring after a couple minutes? You bet. To scratch properly, you've got to pair your samples and your manipulations of the record with a beat. Find an appropriate beat on which to build your music. Look for the break-beats in songs that you like, especially old soul and R&B samples make for good break-beats from which you might build music.

, You will get a high pitched sound. Do the same for the reverse, pull it back at a similar speed. Then, do this to music. This is sometimes known as the baby scratch.


Start with a slower beat and then get faster and faster as you go along. When you are able to do them at a good speed, try to vary the rhythms by throwing in rests to the beats you develop.

, Do some research into beat-making and explore the way your favorite DJs and producers make beats, adding sounds and textures from a variety of sources. If your ultimate goal is to battle or just to make cool analog songs, you need to learn from the greats.


RZA pioneered the lo-fi use of classic soul and samurai film samples, incorporating a few elements into unforgettable beats for the early run of Wu-Tang albums and solo projects from the individual members. Check out Raekwon's ""Ice Cream,"" which features a sped-up easy-listening guitar sample, a beat, and nothing else.
Madlib’s use of jazz records and 80’s ephemera makes him one of the most sought-out modern producers, fusing old and new in surprisingly fresh ways. Check out Madvillainy, his project with MF Doom, and his record with Freddie Gibbs for great examples of turntablist technique.

, It's very important to match the beat of one sample to the beat of another, or your music is going to sound chaotic and, frankly, bad. Use a metronome as you're messing around to get a sense of the beats-per-minute of the different samples that you like using and match one to the other. Build music by matching the beats.


Many DJs will mark the BPMs on the record sleeves themselves, making it easy to quickly build beats and songs while you're working.

, Experiment and play around with a variety of sounds and textures to make music that sounds good. For some DJs, the ultimate goal is to take little samples from the most unexpected sources: latin jazz, spoken word recordings, or easy listening lounge music. Turn it into danceable awesomeness.


Turntablist rule of thumb: Combined with a drum track by the Meters, almost anything sounds cool.

, Don't be contained to playing a track at the exact same speed to match the beats. RZA sampled a corny Earl Klugh guitar track, sped up and pitched up, to create the distinctive sample that runs all throughout ""Ice Cream."" The only limit on your music making is your imagination.

, Nobody wants to hear a DJ who spends an entire set making scratch noises on the records. Think of it as a little seasoning for the song, not as a primary way of making music. There's usually only one or two guitar solos in a rock song, and there should only be one or two scratches in a DJ beat.

, A turntablist is a percussionist, which means you need to have a good understanding of rhythm. You will be practicing scratching to music and then eventually making music using records. When you are scratching to a beat, you are scratching out a rhythm. If you have a complete understanding of rhythm, you can develop your skills to recreate these rhythms properly.


Most hip-hop and dance music is in 4/4. That means for each bar of music there are 4 beats to the bar. Each beat can be subdivided in only a finite amount of ways. Count these out loud while you listen to music. Each beat will be place between :
,


A good way to introduce yourself to beats is to play the snare drum. You can go to the Vic Firth website listed below to get a feel for how beats are subdivided, and how the subdivisions that include rests sound.Once you can sing these rhythms or at least some of them out loud, you can start using these as a foundation for the scratches you develop.

Determine the type of gear you wish to use.,
Determine your budget.,
Get hands-on and do some research.,
Buying New Equipment:

You will have lots of options for buying new.,
Buying Used Equipment:

Make sure you know the price for new gear before agreeing for a used price.",How to Purchase a DJ Setup," There are four typical DJ setups:


Computer only



 


Check out software like: Traktor, VirtualDJ, Ableton, etc. It can be very difficult to DJ with only a computer as you have to remember a number of keyboard shortcuts for things that would normally be intuitive on the other setups but it is a good place to start









Midi Controllers






Controllers may be Midi or USB used for controlling software on a computer which combines more traditional hands on DJing with computer DJing. The controllers usually have control for two virtual decks and a mixer in the middle.
Examples: Vestax VCI-300, Numark NS7, Pioneer DDJ-S1









CD Players

To DJ with CDs you will either need two table-top DJ style CD players or a rack mounted dual CD player. DJ CD players are not the same as consumer CD players; they have features like pitch control and jog wheels which are a necessity. You will also need a mixer in your CD setup.
CD Player Examples: Pioneer CDJ-400, Denon DN-S3500
Mixer Examples: Pioneer DJM-800, Vestax PMC-05Pro



Vinyl Turntables

Similar to CD players but for records (vinyl). You would need two DJ style turntables and a mixer for a vinyl setup.
Turntable Examples: Technics SL-1200, Vestax PDX-3000




A note on turntables and CD players: newer technology allows turntables and CD players to control software on a laptop like a controller. One of the more common interfaces for this purpose is called Serato which is a ""DVS"" or Digital Vinyl System.;
, Before you buy even a single piece of equipment, determine your overall budget. DJ equipment is expensive and only the higher end gear will retain any sort of resale value.


You need to decide if you want to save up for top of the line gear or if you want to start with more affordable entry level equipment. Be aware however that if you opt for the less expensive gear if you ever decide to upgrade it may not have much value if you try to resell it.

, If you are new to DJing it is recommended that you visit a couple stores and actually get hands on with the demo equipment. Stores like Guitar Center and Agiprodj have units on the floor that you can play with and knowledgeable staff that can answer questions. Even if you decide to purchase online you should visit a store and look at what you'll be getting first.

, Most cities have more than one retailer and there is always the option to purchase online. If you are new to DJing you will likely want to select a retailer with knowledgeable staff that can help you along the way.






You will probably want to buy all of the gear at once as most DJ gear needs a full setup to be useful. (For example, two CD players without a mixer would be impossible to mix on.)






Setup financing only if necessary. A lot of audio retailers have financing options for expensive purchases like DJ equipment but with interest you will pay more than retail so use financing only if you have no other option.







, You do not want to pay retail for used gear.






Assess the condition of the gear. Whenever possible you should test the gear, if that is not an option at least inspect for any major defects.

CD Players DJ CD Players are different from home stereo CD players.,
Turntables Turntables allow the playing of 33RPM and 45RPM records.,
Mixers Mixers are what allow the DJ to take two or more audio sources and blend them together to a single output.,
Headphones These are one of the DJ's most important tools, if you are looking to save money when you buy your equipment headphones are not the place to be cheap.,
Cables Cables are what connects each component to the whole.",How to Install Your DJ Booth1," CD Decks used by DJs generally include pitch control, advanced anti-skip, and a jog wheel which is used to manipulate the song that is playing. There are two types of CD players used by DJs:



Table Top Table top CD players sit on a flat surface like turntable and can each play a single CD. Table top CD players generally have a large jog wheel and may include vinyl simulation.

Examples: Pioneer CDJ1000, Denon DN-S3500




Rack Mounted Rack mount CD players may take a single CD like the table top's but more often are Dual-CD where half controls one CD and the other half controls a second CD. Rack mounted CD players are often used by mobile DJs because the fit well in mobile cases.

Examples: Pioneer MEP-7000, American Audio VELOCITY


;
, DJ Turntables will include pitch control and may have other features such as reverse or multiple start/stop buttons so you can orient them as you see fit on your table. There are two types of DJ turntable:



Belt Drive The main advantage of the belt driven turntable is the motor is set to the side of the platter and the spin is generated by a continuous belt thus reducing vibration. The problem with belt drive turntables is that they often lack the torque to bring the platter to speed as quickly as you need to and are more susceptible to speed (pitch) variations.

Examples: Gemini TT01, Numark TT1600MKII




Direct Drive Direct drive turntables have the benefit of the motor being directly connected to the platter thus allowing for greater torque and faster start/stop times there is also no belt which could become worn and need replacing.

Examples: Technics SL1200MK2, Vestax PDX-200MK2




, Mixers also usually include basic EQ controls for Bass, Mid, and Treble. There are two main types of DJ Mixers:



Battle Mixers Battle mixers are generally very slim, have limited extra features beyond what is necessary, have a very shallow curve on the individual channel volume controls, and very high quality cross-faders. They are used primarily by DJs who scratch records.

Examples: Mackie D2-PRO, Vestax PMC-06-Pro




DJ Mixers Everything else falls under this category. DJ mixers have usually between 2 and 4 channels and may include 1 or 2 mic inputs. Most newer DJ mixers also include some basic effects and may even include an automatic BPM counter.

Examples: Pioneer DJM-800, Denon DNX1500




, DJ's use their headphones to cue the next song and make sure everything is mixed correctly before raising the volume and letting people hear it. The headphones used by DJ's need to be loud to overcome monitors and crowd noise, clear so the DJ can hear the details in the songs, and comfortable because they will be worn for long periods of time.




Examples: Sennheiser HD-25 are used by many pro DJs all over the world, crisp, clear and loud with great cancellation from outside noise, Sony MDRV700's, Behringer HPX2000's, Technics RPDH1200's




, There are a number of different types of cables that you may encounter:



RCA Cables These are basic audio cables, they are a dual cable with two separate connectors on each end usually colour coded red and white. 1/4"" Patch Cables Sometimes used to connect the mixer to speakers these cables have a 1/4"" male plug on both ends. 1/4"" to Banana Cables These cables are used to connect some amplifiers to speakers that are not self powered. XLR Cables These are most commonly used for microphones however they may be used to connect some brands of speakers as well. "

Unpack your equipment First up we need to remove everything from it's boxes.,
Place the items on a flat surface You always want to place your DJ equipment on a flat and sturdy surface.,
Decide on a Layout You need to decide how you will lay out your equipment.,
Connect the turntables to the mixer Each turntable should come with an RCA Cable (See above) and a Ground Cable (Cannot be removed) connect the RCA cable to the underside or back of the turntable colour coordinating red-to-red and white-to-white and connect the opposite ends the the input on the back of the mixer (NOTE: If the mixer has inputs for ""Phono"" and ""Line"" connect turntables to Phono and CD players to Line, most DJs prefer to plug the right turntable into Channel 1 and the left turntable into Channel 2 or 4).,
Connect your power cables The mixes and both of your turntables will need to be plugged into AC Power.,
Connect your headphones Usually the headphones plug into a jack on the front or top face of the mixer marked with a picture of headphones be sure not to plug these into the out lines on the back of the mixer.

,
Connect Speakers (Optional) You can listen to everything in your headphones if you like but for others to hear the music you will need speakers.,
Power everything up and have fun!

",How to Install Your DJ Booth3," Be careful when removing items such as turntables as they can be fragile and may have cables that are soldered on that you do not want to accidentally tear off.


While unpacking try to keep the cables together with the items they came with.
For turntables follow the included instructions for assembling and attacking the cartridges and needles, and if it is not already in place for installing the platter.

, The heavier the table the better protected from ground vibration you will be.

, The most common layout is however some people prefer . You also need to decide on an orientation for the turntables:



Standard (Horizontal) Standard orientation will see the tone-arm and pitch on the right and the start/stop on the edge closest to you and to the left. This is used by DJ's who mix records as they need easy access to the pitch.

Battle (Vertical) Battle position will see the tone-arm and pitch on the edge furthest away from you and the start/stop on the edge closest to you and to the right. This is used by scratch artists as it keeps the tone arm out of the way so they do not bump it when preforming quick scratches.

, You also need to connect the ground cables which are usually thin black cables with a ""C"" shaped connector this will fit over a screw on the back of the mixer labeled ""Ground"" or ""GRND"" and help reduce line noise.

, It is recommended you use a serge protector or a power bar with serge protection for this to protect your equipment.

,, Check the back of your speakers and the back of you mixer to determine the type of cables you need. Ensure the mixer and the speakers are both off and then connect the cable from the output of the mixer to the input of the speakers. Always turn the mixer on before turning on the speakers to avoid sending a power 'pop' to the speakers.

Know your event.,
Know your responsibilities.,
Know your role expectations.,
Do your research.,
Stay organized.,
Remain calm.,
Prepare the opening of the event.,
Introduce the speakers.,
Bridge between segments.,
Be prepared for anything.,
Close the event.",How to Be a Good Master of Ceremonies," Knowing your event is important for all types of ceremonies, whether it’s a wedding, graduation, bar mitzvah, celebrity roast, etc. The type of event will dictate the type of atmosphere you, the MC, need to create. Knowing what’s going on, what should be talked about and what is coming next is key to being a successful MC.


Consider meeting with the people organizing the event, and going over the planned structure and reviewing the itinerary of the event in detail.;
, The MC is responsible for creating and sustaining the intended atmosphere throughout the event. The intended atmosphere may vary depending on the type of event, although most events that hire an MC are looking to create a fun and energetic atmosphere. As MC, your main responsibilities include:Keeping the event flowing and bridging between segments of the event.
Keeping the interest of the audience and make sure they’re having fun.
Helping the audience feel respected and engaging with them during the event.
Helping the speakers feel valued.
Keeping the event on time.
Keeping everyone updated on what is happening at the event.

, Being an MC means that you have a great sense of humor, you can work a crowd, and you’re a practiced public speaker.This means that you have to be prepared to improvise, so you can react efficiently to whatever that may arise. For example, you may have to momentarily entertain the audience while waiting for the next speaker to get out of the bathroom or for the broken microphone to be replaced.


Remember to smile. Smiling reinforces the fun and lighthearted ambiance of the event, and makes you appear to be an enthusiastic MC.
Keep in mind that just because you’re the MC, you are not the celebrity of the show. You are supposed to make others feel like they’re the stars of the show.

, Contact your key speakers to find out some background information on them, and use that information to prepare your introductions for the speakers. This background research will help you construct introductions that sound more personal and genuine.


Find out if there are any special audience members who should be recognized during the event.Make sure you review everyone’s name and title so you know how to say it on stage when the time comes to make their announcement., Create or review a given agenda for the event, and plan out, minute by minute, the event schedule. Take into consideration the time it takes to get on and off the stage, make introductions for guests, and speeches or thank yous from guest members.Consider making a rough script of what you’re going to say throughout the night. This script is something that you can memorize, have small notecards to keep yourself on task, or have an outline projected throughout the event for you to follow.It may be helpful to tell the lead organizer of the event that, as MC, you’re only going to answer to one person in charge. If any changes need to be made to the program, the only way you are going to allow that to happen is if the one person in charge approves the changes. This will reduce mix-ups and miscommunication during the event, and help the event run smoother., Being an MC is a lot of pressure. The event’s success is largely contributed to how well the MC keeps things on track. While the event’s proceedings can get hectic, it is important to remain calm and focus on maintaining your MC persona. To keep your cool, try:



Continuing on if you mess up. Stopping will only make your mistake that much more obvious. Try to roll with the punches and continue on from your mistake. If you do this successfully, the audience will most likely forget your misstep.

Finding a spot to look at while talking. Looking at the individual audience members might make you more nervous while speaking. Instead, try looking over the heads of the audience members to reduce intimidating one on one eye contact.

Slowing down with your words. Nothing shows you’re more nervous as an MC, than talking too quickly. Talking too quickly can lead to mispronunciations and stuttering, which can affect people understanding you. Take your time, and pause slightly in between sentences.

, Introduce yourself and welcome the audience to the event. Identify the specific, principal groups of your audience, and welcome them individually. These welcomes don’t need to be long-winded, but they do need to be authentic.


For example, you might say something like, “To all of our Packer fan dairy farmers who traveled all the way from Wisconsin and had to drive through Bear territory to get here, a warm welcome.”, The MC has the key responsibility of introducing different speakers that come up on stage, as well as other key people at the event. The more pertinent a guest is, the more detailed and tailored your introduction of them should be.Once you have made your introduction for a speaker, lead the audience in applauding the speaker until they reach the speaking microphone. When the speaker is finished giving their speech, lead the audience again in applause until the speaker is off the stage and on their way back to their seat.


Since one of the biggest responsibilities as MC is to keep the event running on time, don’t be afraid to notify a speaker if they are past their assigned time. You can try to give them a note or give them some kind of visual cue, such as spinning a finger pointing upward to try and communicate to “wrap it up.”
Before you go on to introduce the next segment, thank the speaker for their presentation, and lightly touch on something they mentioned while speaker on stage. This reference can be something that was funny, interesting, or stirring.This shows you are an attentive MC, and it confirms the value of the speaker’s presentation.

, Connecting one segment to the next can be easier by using some humor to bridge the two. Before the event starts, try to prepare some talking bits like remarks, anecdotes, or jokes that can be used in between segments.Also, comment on what just happened. Try and find something funny or meaningful about the previous speaker or performance, and transition from there onto the next speaker or performance.


If you find yourself in an awkward spot, try asking your audience questions. Questions should be kept to a “yes” or “no” answer, but by asking questions, you can keep your audience engaged and focused, while reinforcing your command as MC.
Nothing is worse than an MC not acknowledging something that just occurred on stage. It gives the impression that the MC isn’t aware of what is going on.
If the event is a few hours long it could be helpful to give a short summary of the performances and presentations that have occurred during breaks in the action. You could also disclose what’s to come next., As mentioned earlier, a great MC must always be on their toes. Live events are notorious for having slight hiccups: a server might spill a drink, the wrong music might play, or the scheduled speaker might be on their way back from the bathroom. Keep control of the event by being ready to smooth over any distractions or mishaps to keep the mood light.If something goes wrong or someone is acting unruly, the MC must stay positive.
Remember that it’s not your job to reprimand someone, it’s your job to keep things running smoothly in spite of something going wrong. An MC having a negative attitude in any way, would be extremely distasteful and inappropriate.

, Your closing of the event should be as exciting and sincere as your opening. Normally to close the event, the MC thanks all of the attendants, speakers, and performers. It’s good manners to also thank everyone who helped to put the event together. Summarize what took place at the event and what was learned, and then depending on what kind of event it was, encourage the audience members to take action.This could mean coming again for the next gathering, donating money, or continuing to pioneer in a certain field. Whatever it may be, encourage for the audience to participate.

Get two direct-drive turntables.,
Get an appropriate pre-amp for your turntable, if necessary.,
Get the necessary vinyl hardware.,
Get a mixer.,
Consider getting your own PA speakers.,
Consider investing in a DJ starter pack.,
Start collecting a sizable amount of vinyl records.",How to Buy Your First Set of DJ Equipment1," Any basic DJ set-up must involve two record players for you to simultaneously play one song while beat-matching another, cross-fading, scratching, and doing all the little tricks that make DJ-ing an art. Without simultaneous turntables, it's hard to pull off on vinyl, beat matching etc. Good turntables are the single most important place to spend your money.


A good starter turntable is the Audio Technica 1240, which is somewhat cheaper than AT's high-end models, but is still high quality. It also features USB inputs to allow for digital-analog interface. It's a good professional record player for the beginner.It's important that you do not get a belt-drive turntable for DJing. While perfectly useful for listening to vinyl at your house, belt-driven turntables feature a separate motor that drives a rubber belt, which is used to spin the plate and the record. This means you can't scratch or pause the record player while you're spinning. Direct-drive motors are directly attached to the plate, making them ideal for DJs.





;
, Depending on your record player, you might need a pre-amp to boost sound. Some record players have built-in pre-amps that make external varieties somewhat obsolete, but it's best to be sure. When you purchase your turntables, make sure to find out whether or not you'll need a preamp to go with them.


Pre-amps can run anywhere from $50-500, and while it's nowhere near the most essential item in your set-up, a good pre-amp has everything to do with the quality of the sound you're going to get. Without good quality sound, nobody is going to dance to your killer sets. Keep that in mind when you're buying your gear.







, Since a record player is essentially a needle scratching into vinyl grooves to create sound, there are a lot of little things that'll help to optimize the sound quality and the durability of your set-up. There's a lot to balance all at once. You'll need things like:


record cleaning fluid and a vinyl brush






extra styluses and cartridges






an anti-static slip-mat for the turntable






RCA cables






an outlet power strip






a great pair of headphones







, An entry-level mixer, like a Vestax would be appropriate to connect your two turntables and shift between them. This is an important piece of a DJ's gear. When you see someone spinning records and performing that distinctive flip-switch during the scratches, that's on the mixer. You can fade between your two channels, adjust the volume, and make other necessary adjustments. Most of the tricks of the trade are found here.

, If you want to be truly independent--a traveling party machine--you'll also need to invest in your own speakers to play your music through. A good pair of Mackies or Behringers can cost anywhere from $100 to well in excess of that. Think about the size of the rooms you'll be playing and the kind of sound you'll have to compete with, and invest in a good but moderate variety of speaker.If you're trying to get into DJing at a venue or other place with a house PA, then you could hold off on getting speakers, which can be expensive, but if you're going to play parties, you'll need to provide your own speakers. Don't risk playing through a crappy home entertainment sound system. Get some high quality speakers you know your careful playlists will sound great through.

, Audio Technica and other brands will often compile starter packs, that provide you will a relatively cheap pair of turntables, a mixer, and the other necessary equipment to get started DJing, at less than the cost of purchasing everything separately. In general, the quality is at the low end of the spectrum, but that's what makes it perfect for the beginner: you don't know the difference yet.


These packages usually run about $1200, and are a great option if you're not a big audiophile with lots of opinions about what kind of gear you want to learn on.

, Essential to the vinyl DJ's set-up is his collection of tasty and obscure vinyl records that'll get crowds moving. Start hitting up places where you can buy vinyl cheaply and reliably, and start learning to look for deep-cuts and grooves that nobody's heard before, as well as the latest in electronic and dance music.


Hit up the regular used record stores, but don't neglect thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales for the best deals. Libraries regularly are still liquidating their old stock and have basements full of vinyl waiting to be plucked on the cheap.






Thai psychedelic funk? Mexican psych rock? The great vinyl is out there waiting to be discovered by DJs like you. Start learning to recognize labels that you respect and who reliably put out good vinyl, even if you've never heard it. When you see anything on that label for a good price, snatch it up.






Treat a record collection like an investment. If you buy something that doesn't end up striking you, sell it for more than you spent on it, and then turn that money around to get something else. Build the collection slowly, only keeping around the absolute best stuff. Vinyl collectors are a diverse community, so start participating!

For a traditional vinyl set-up, you'll need two direct-drive turntables, with pre-amp, if necessary, a mixer, speakers, and a tasteful stack of vinyl LPs to scratch.
For a more contemporary digital set-up, you'll need a laptop, a mixer, a CD-style turntable, and speakers.;
, The only difference between a DJ that plays hip-hop and a DJ that plays other kinds of music is whether or not you've got an MC rapping over the top of the sounds. The skills are transferable, which means you've got to learn how to get started like anybody else: building songs from break-beats and samples, playing full songs, and mixing them together on the fly. You need to practice the following skills, to DJ in any genre:


Beat-match the intros and outros of songs, to keep the BPM consistent in your transitions
Cross-fade the songs seamlessly
Scratch and improvise sound effects
Structure a set of music

, A good DJ is a music collector. Whether you're going analog or digital, you need to start building up a diverse music collection, featuring all sorts of different artists, genres, and styles of music, from all eras. Good DJs are music lovers, able to appreciate super-bleak strains of Norwegian black metal, as well as Flamenco guitar recordings, folk music, and classical. Start collecting like you work in a museum.

, Lots of bands incorporate scratching and other live DJ elements into their performances and their overall sound. If you're interested in a primer on using DJ sounds in a variety of styles, check out the following artists:


Joe Hahn (Linkin Park)
DJ Panko (Ojos de Brujo)
DJ Homicide (Sugar Ray)
DJ Spinobi (Ozomatli)

, Most DJs work as party-starters, playing dance music to club goers. It's part art, part skills, and all fun. A good DJ is a people-watcher, paying close attention to the crowd that's listening. Learn to watch closely for signs that you're gaining dancers, or losing people to the bar, and tailor your set accordingly.


It's best to go in with a short set planned out, 3-5 track to get a feel for what people will like. Do subtle variations in style in those songs, playing a bit of pop-dance style music, as well as more experimental jams to see what gets people popping. Follow them.

, Even if you want to be an artist, that bar full of college kids is still going to want to hear the newest pop song, even if you can't bear to hear it again. A good DJ wants to please the crowd and get people moving, not play super-obscure tracks because it's on your set-list. Being a specialist can make your gigs much more rare.

, Most DJs tend to specialize, spinning house, jungle beat, or trance primarily, but lots of DJs move fluidly between genres, spinning lots of different styles of music seamlessly, and taking pleasure in being schizophrenic in terms of taste. If you want to stand out as a non-hip-hop DJ, it's important to familiarize yourself with lots of kinds of music.

, Again, even if you're an instrumentalist and an artist, it's important to pay attention to what's peaking on the charts these days, in the case that you'll need to drop some Top 40 bombs on the dancefloor. Being a club DJ is artistry, even if you're playing commercial pop music part of the time. It's an essential skill, being familiar and comfortable playing that kind of music.

, It's also important to be just as well versed in Jackson 5, early Stevie Wonder, disco, and more contemporary dance music and pop. Good DJs will have to play for a variety of crowds, even those who may be less familiar with and receptive to contemporary dance music. These people will be appreciative of more traditional dance music, which you should also build a considerable library of.

, One great way to get a club moving with surprising tunes is to make them yourself. If you think you've got what it takes to do more than scratch the songs other people make, consider building your own songs and collaging dance music and melodies yourself. Check out the following wikiHow articles to learn the skills necessary to make electronic dance music:

Get some CD turntables.,
Get some DJ software.,
Consider a digital turntable controller.,
Just line your computer into some speakers.,
Get a digital interface.,
Get an external hard drive.",How to Buy Your First Set of DJ Equipment2," If you want to dive straight into the most modern technology and start becoming one of the DJs illuminating by the glow of a Macbook on stage, then you're going to need to start with a good pair of CD turntables.


The good news? These are incredibly versatile, useful, and can hold an incredible amount of music. You'll have literally thousands of songs at your fingertips, ready to mash-up beats and verses in crazy combinations, as opposed to being stuck with the crate-full of heavy vinyl you'll have to drag to the club with an old-school set up.
The bad news? These are expensive. At the low-end, a single CD turntable can cost up to $700, making an investment for a pair neighboring on the ridiculous. For this reason, many digital DJs prefer to line-in a laptop and play sound files directly, or use Ableton Live.

, Serato Scratch Live or Traktor Scratch are typical digital DJ packages that allow you to do everything that a vinyl DJ does on his mixer and turntables on your computer. You won't be able to have the same kind of touch available to tactile records, but you can still approximate a lot of the same distinctive sounds and effects, especially if you have a digital turntable or some other way of mixing the sounds manually.

, There are also devices called DJ controllers, which are almost exactly like video game controllers (in that you use them to plug into your computer, basically). They don't actually play music in and of themselves, but you can use them to simulate the action of mixing on real turntables, but while playing MP3s or other sound files from your computer set-up., At the most basic, being a digital DJ might mean hooking your computer up to a set of good-quality speakers and pushing play on your pre-mixed set lists. It's not the most fun way of playing a DJ set, because it doesn't allow you to read the crowd or acquire any of the skills and touches that an analog DJ has, but it's a popular option, increasingly.

, Regardless of what kind of turntables you're using, if you want to use any kind of software while you're on stage, you're going to need to invest in some kind of digital interface that connects the RCA-style ports on your hardware with the USB ports on your computer. A lot of these will also come with DJ software, like the Traktor brand.

, It's good to have your tunes backed up on an external hard drive that you can carry around with you and not bog down any of your hardware, or your computer. A Seagate One Terabyte hard drive is almost impossible to fill up, and super-compact and easy to set-up, making it a good investment for digital audio files.

Learning to structure a set, mix on the fly, and get a crowd moving all starts with your deck. Later on, you can invest in bigger speakers, a monitor, a MIDI controller, an audio interface, mics, and various plug-ins, depending on your ambitions for playing out, but a bare-bones basic DJ setup needs to include the following:


Two turntables or two CD players (or more, optionally)
2-channel mixer
Headphones
Speakers
Mixing software (optional);
, Traditional DJ set-ups revolve around direct-drive turntables for playing vinyl records, but it's increasingly common to use CD-style and straight-digital set-ups for playing DJ sets as well. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but are perfectly effective for playing gigs and becoming a DJ.

Analog set-ups will allow you to DJ in the most traditional way, learning the skills the way they were pioneered: scratching a stylus against vinyl. This will require you to collect a sizable collection of vinyl records to play, which can be somewhat expensive.
Digital set-ups allow you to be extremely mobile, and the learning curve will be much smaller when you're working with a digital set-up. Learning to beat-match and transition, for example, will be much easier with a BPM counter and a software system.

, Serato Scratch or Traktor are great programs that can read any format of music and select songs through a computer program interface. Pioneer and Numark also offer various products you may want to eventually look into.These programs will enable you to access a library of MP3s on your hard drive to compliment your vinyl and CD selections. More often than not, these programs provide live looping and scratching capability, delays and reverberations, real-time control and video and karaoke options.
Ableton is a program that allows you to connect mixing controllers via USB cable and operates more like the classic DJ in your head does. It's good for beginners and the budget-conscious.

, Don't invest in top-dollar equipment right away. Most of your money should be spent on turntables and a mixer. Forget the other stuff for now. And spend wisely -- buy your decks used and your mixer new.


If you're serious about being a DJ, odds are you're aware of a few in your area. Hit them up for advice or for a tutorial on their system! If they're half as passionate as you are, they'll love to give you a minute of their time, explaining their ways.

, Most DJs record demos, playlists and original music at home. Make sure the equipment you bring to the club compliments the equipment you use at home. For example, if you're a hip-hop DJ, you'll probably want to invest in a scratch/battle mixer at home to simulate a competition environment.


This will be especially useful if you ever plan on producing. We'll get to the value of that in a bit, but know that it should be an avenue of your career later on down the line.

, If you plan to play for a venue that already has a DJ setup, you might only need a laptop with music mixing software. If you plan to play in private venues, you'll probably need to provide your own equipment. Scope out what you need and what you don't for your particular job.


Some music mixing software may be hard to learn. You can find great tutorials online for most types. Otherwise, DJ schools can teach you about the cutting-edge stuff out there -- but know that you can do it yourself.

, You know what else you need? Music. And you don't want crappy, third-rate mp3 download versions of those songs either. To be a legit DJ, you'll at least eventually have to pay for the music you get. For now, work with what you have, but know that it will be an expense later on in the game. You need to be a music expert. Hit up your friends and consult the charts, YouTube channels of record companies and websites catering especially to DJs such as Beatport. Here's a list of genres to explore:


House
Trance
Techno
Electro
Glitch
Dark Alternative
Progressive
Breakbeat
Hardstyle
Hardcore
Downtempo
Jungle
Drum and Bass
Dubstep
Hip-Hop

, The beats per minute (BPM) of a song will determine how smoothly or easily you can mix it with another song. You can calculate BPM by counting the beats yourself using a stopwatch, but that's pretty tedious. Some mixers will have a BPM counter on the board, while most DJ software will calculate the BPM of a track for you, although this may not be completely accurate 100% of the time, so it's good to have some sense of the BPMs yourself.


You can use a pitch warp to match the beats, though it's best to choose two songs that are only a few BPM off. However, use it on the song that doesn't have vocals yet. Speeding it up or slowing it down changes the key and messes with everything.

, Most dance songs will have an intro in which the music is going but the vocals are not at the beginning of the song and a corresponding outro at the end. Mixing usually means blending one song's intro with the outro of another. Knowing when an outro starts and an intro begins is critical to live beat mixing.


Cue up the second song. Have your second song ready to go as your first one is winding down. Use one hand on the turntable or CD player's pitch to adjust speed (if your BPMs don't match) and put the other on the crossfader, so that the first song's volume decreases as the second song's volume increases.

, The decks can be used to find your place in a song when they're queued up or they can be use as pseudo-records to get your scratch on. There are baby scratches and scribble scratches and drags and scratches that work at different pitch levels.Get 'em all down before you head out there!


Certain songs and certain places in certain songs are prime for scratching, while others are terrible for it. Knowing when to scratch is like comedic timing: you'll know it when it's right and when it's just wrong.

, When you're starting out, make mixing easier by sticking to two songs that are within 3 BPMs of each other. You should also use two songs that are in the same key. Your software should be able to tell you this. When you nail that down, start experimenting with looping and then move on to your toggle function and adding effects.


Also be sure to experiment with the different methods on your mixer. For most effects, there's more than one way to do them. You'll find what you prefer (generally one method is a very do-it-yourself way and the other is more automated).

, One of the most important parts of DJing is transitioning between songs, matching beats so that the beat remains constant, letting people continue dancing, uninterrupted. Using conventional DJ hardware, this involves listen to the second song's intro in your headphones, moving the pitch slider until the songs play at the same speed, and cueing the song simultaneously with the preceding song. Learning to do this smoothly is one of the essential skills of DJing.


You also need to adjust the volume levels of the songs. The song you are mixing out of will be playing at full volume, so you need to adjust the second up slowly, listening closely to the tune to bring it up subtly.Never mix vocals over vocals. It's important to avoid creating awkward noise, which means you need to be super-familiar with the songs intros and outros.
Digitally, it's possible to use beat-matching software to do this automatically, provided that the songs are within a few BPM of one another. It's still good to learn how to do it analog, since this is a fundamental skill.

, What's going to start off as an expensive hobby can turn into a career in some time. This is not a small feat you are about to embark upon. To be a DJ is to devote years to working magic on others' music. You may be able to start in an hour, but you won't get truly good for a long, long time.


This is also not a Wednesday afternoon hobby. If you want to develop any level of skill, you'll need to work at it. Counting to 4 may be an integral part of DJing, but reading crowds and knowing what music surprisingly goes great with what music is a skill that has to be honed.

, Certain gigs will require that you make a few compromises. A college bar may want to hear Katy Perry when you're just trying to forget Last Friday Night. Being a specialist may give you more cred with the DJs, but it may make your gigs fewer and far between.


Crowd pleasing means playing songs that would, most likely, hit the taste of the biggest number of people in any given crowd. This style of DJing is best suited to private events, such as weddings or small parties.
A music specialist sticks to a particular genre of music, regardless of what the crowd demands. Usually, these DJs play nightclubs who have specific genre standards or they have an established following based on a certain type of music.

, Find a DJ whose style you admire and observe him or her as much as possible. Pay attention to how songs are constructed and how the crowd is managed. After you've watched them a few times, approach the DJ after the show and ask for a few tips. Most DJs will be happy to help guide you if they know you're serious.


Gain inspiration from the DJs that hit it big. Sometimes it can help to look up to professionals such as Headhunterz, Tiesto, Avicii, Knife Party, Sebastian Ingrosso, Deadmau5, and Skrillex.

, You can still be a specialist if you have multiple genres under your belt -- you're just a specialist with logic. Most DJs are great at one genre of music -- being great at more than one sets you up to be the cream of the crop.


This also offers you more opportunities for future gigs. Instead of only having one or two clubs in the area that'll have you, you can do those, a few other clubs, and the occasional wedding or hoppin' bar mitzvah.
For each genre you do, you'll have to know the classics, the deep cuts (the B sides that should've been A sides), and the current stuff. Having a healthy mix in your repertoire will keep the party going., In order to be viable in today's fast-paced world, you'll need to be on top of all the charts and where it seems like the trends are going. You have to be on top of today and leaning toward tomorrow.


You should be constantly writing yourself notes, finding out what that song you just heard was, and keeping a list of ideas for later when you're sitting down and doing your thing. Always keep your phone or a pen handy because inspiration calls when it pleases. And so does your best friend when he wants you to hear this new track he's working on.

, Just like a pilot needs to build up flight time to get cred, you'll need to build up play time. The best way to do this in a serious fashion is to get recurring hours through an established company -- not just those one-off gigs.


Find companies that supply DJs to weddings and the like. You won't be freelancing, but you'll be getting your foot in the door.
Sign up to work at a local college or community radio station.
Some venues need between-band DJs. Let that be you!, Having an idea of who your crowd is before the event begins is critical to successful DJing. If you're playing a wedding, for instance, be prepared to play more slow songs than usual and try to get a grasp on the bride's musical tastes beforehand. If you're playing a nightclub, get familiar with what the club owner prefers and what his or her regulars like. The regulars keep the club afloat and, by extension, pay your fee; learn how to keep them happy.


Be careful with requests. If you're playing a nightclub that caters to a hip-hop crowd and you have a tourist or someone unfamiliar with the scene requesting a song that doesn't fit with the genre, consider carefully before you play it. Remember, your aim is to keep the core of the audience happy and coming back.
If at all possible, visit the venue beforehand. Getting a feel for the regular crowd before you go can help take the pressure off a new gig.

, You should be making press kits, handing out business cards, emailing constantly, and always, always expanding your network. This is not a 9-5 job, no, it's a 24/7 job.


Keep a busy schedule. As you're gaining a fan base, play as many shows as necessary to get your name out there. Book yourself on a tight schedule at first to keep your interest alive and your creativity fresh. Basically at the beginning: take whatever gigs you can.

, If you don't have the time or money to build your own website, start an account for your DJing career on Twitter or Facebook. Promote your shows, and make time to connect with your fans and personally respond to their messages. The more you're a real person to these people, the better.


Make playlists. Build playlists on iTunes or Spotify and share them with your fans. This allows them to sample your musical tastes, and lets you introduce people to new music you want to incorporate into your shows. This won't defeat the purpose of them coming to see you, it'll simply whet their appetites.

, Depending on how you want to advance your career, you could start playing small, private events for a low fee, or take a slow, weeknight shift at a club or bar. Ask a friend who's hosting a party if you can DJ. Be aware that if you're inexperienced, you won't make much money at first and you'll probably have to keep a second job. But you'd do this for free if you had to, right?


When you first start off, people may book you on the stipulation that you bring X number of people. This is crap. You are not the promoter and you are not your friends. However...sometimes you gotta take what you can get. Know that these guys are only the ones you're working with now; avoid them in the future.

, The next step up from being a DJ is producing your own music. You can still work with others' tunes, but you're mashing it all up, remixing it, re-editing it and making it better. DJ Earworm got YouTube famous doing just that.You can rake in the cash a lot faster when you start producing your own stuff.


And once that happens, you can hit up record labels. Even if you don't end up being a top-billing artist, you can work with other artists and behind the scenes doing what you love.

, As a DJ, you are responsible for entertaining a large group of people all by yourself. The music you play is important, but you also need to pay attention to how you act on stage. Don't just stand there hunched over your decks. That's boring. Try to be someone who attracts attention in a good way. Also, learn when to step back and let the group dynamic take over.

, Use the music to manage the event, driving it forward. Divide different styles of songs into different sections. Play slower, quieter songs at the beginning of the party. Slowly slip into a jazzier groove, and pull out the heavier songs at the end. Above all, read the crowd and notice what they're responding to.


Don't play mostly fast songs at a wedding. This will take away from the romantic atmosphere.
Don't play mostly slow songs at a gathering of kids. They will get bored fast.

, Show up to your events on-time and fully prepared. Give each gig your best effort. Have fun with the crowd, but keep your interactions professional and respectful, since you never know who's watching.


Straight up, the DJ world is full of scumbags. You want to be that good apple that isn't a part of the bunch. If you're not professional, there are a zillion other guys and gals out there chomping at the bit to take your spot.

, Working in clubs and the like isn't always a pretty picture. Remember that 95% of the time the majority of the people listening to your music will either be some level of drunk, high, or both.They may give you a hard time on occasion. This has got to go in your ear and out the other.


In addition to rowdy or unappreciative crowds, you'll be dealing with shady promoters and technical disasters. Use your savvy people skills to navigate through these issues and let them make you all the better for it.

, Imagine going to a show (or maybe you already have been witness to this) and seeing a DJ that's busy pushing buttons like he'd rather be hauling rocks. It's terrible. Watching a DJ that doesn't even like their own music is practically worse than a three-piece polka band with earplugs. So make it clear that you're enjoying yourself and the crowd will follow suit.


You're totally allowed to go a bit crazy. The more you feel it, the more your inclinations will be spot on. The more spot on you are, the more the crowd wants you back.

, After all that hard work of taking crap gigs and working with a crap company and modifying on less-than-stellar equipment, it's time to up the ante. When the money is coming in at more than a trickle, upgrade your equipment. The industry standard is the Technics 1200, but you can even upgrade from there. You're looking at a few thousand dollars in the long-run, but you'll make it back and then some.


Start figuring out your rates. How much are you worth? You don't want to be a DJ diva about it, but you don't want to sell yourself short. Account for distance traveled, if you're bringing your own equipment, and the general realities of the gig (some are quite clearly better than others). And don't forget: are they feeding you?

, The best sets flow together from song to song, avoiding staying on one style for two long.

, Playing to your own crowd helps build your confidence, having friends on the dance-floor encourages others to join in, and you will never upset a barman by bringing along thirsty customers.

, Most mixers take a couple of minutes to learn for segue-ing but it's always good to know exactly how it functions. It's also good to ensure that your music is in a format the equipment can use.

, Bring your own headphones, get to the booth with plenty of time to avoid a rush, and check what has been played before. It is often considered bad form to repeat earlier songs or artists. If the club records set lists then be sure to bring a pen.

, Play track one, whilst it's playing focus on what track two will be and where you want to go after that. Don't think beyond track three or you will not be able to adjust for the audience or for the better track choice idea that will come along.

, If you are getting a reaction then be ready to go with it and give them a bit more of what they fancy. If they are dancing then go with what keeps them up there, if they are listening then keep them tapping their feet.

Amount of Music : Before you can even begin to play music at a school dance it is important to have a large selection of music prepared ahead of time.,
Type of Music : When you accept the gig be sure to ask the event coordinator what type of music has been played at these events in the past as you want to ensure you have appropriate music for the venue and the crowd.,
Radio Edits : Always ask the event coordinator how much tolerance there will be for objectionable language.",How to Be a Good DJ at a Dance1," If you are not taking requests the general rule of thumb is to have at bare minimum enough music to play the event, plus an additional hour or two so if certain music is not working well you have enough additional music to fall back on. (NOTE: One Hour = Approx. 12-20 songs).


If you will be taking requests it is important to have enough music to make the odds of you having the requested songs pretty good. One way of doing this is taking the Billboard Annual Top 100 charts for the last 3-5 years and trying to obtain all of the songs listed plus at least one other single from each of the artists.;
,


For example: If you know the dance is a Ho-Down themed event it is important to be well stocked on Country music, if the event is a Valentine's Day dance extra slow songs may be in order, etc.
Make sure to bring a variety of musical styles however just in case the crowd becomes tired of a certain genre or you start getting requests for something different.

, Many schools will allow a small amount of inappropriate language, others will allow for none.

Determine your budget.,
Choose between a belt drive or direct drive turntable.,
Choose between a manual or automatic turntable.,
Determine whether you need a built-in phono preamp.,
Evaluate the cartridge included with the turntable.",How to Choose a Turntable," Turntables are available across a huge spectrum of prices, so establishing a budget will help narrow down your search. Reliable vintage turntables can be had quite cheaply, and can generally be found in online auctions or at specialty stores. Newer turntables are generally more expensive, because they are designed to cater to the high-end audiophile niche market.;
, The platter (the part on which the record rests) of a turntable is rotated using a motor. This motor can either be mounted directly under the platter (called ""direct drive"") or located off to the side (called ""belt drive"").


Belt drive turntables are generally preferred by the audiophile community. The rubber belt which joins the platter and the motor absorbs shock, keeping the motor's vibration from causing noise in the electric signal.
Direct drive turntables are preferred by disc jockeys (DJs). On direct drive turntables, the platter can be rotated backwards by hand without harming the turntable, which allows for interesting audio effects. Direct drive tables also offer very consistent rotational speed.

, Turntables are classified as either manual or automatic based on the process used to set the tonearm onto the record.


Manual turntables require the user to lift the tonearm and place it onto the spinning record by hand; this process is sometimes aided by a ""cueing"" function that lifts and lowers the tonearm slowly. Manual turntables are prized by audio enthusiasts because they have fewer parts which can cause vibrations in the tonearm.
Automatic tonearms can play records at the push of a button. The tonearm rises from its rest, moves to the side, plays the record and then returns to its rest all automatically. This type of turntable is suitable for novice users.

, Because the signal produced by the stylus is so quiet, turntables require what is called a phono preamp to bring the volume up to a manipulable level. Many modern receivers will not have a dedicated ""Phono"" input jack, which means that your turntable will need a built-in preamp. As an alternative, you can purchase an external phono preamp.

, The cartridge is a small component that connects to the tonearm and holds the stylus. When buying a vintage or used turntable, it is generally a good idea to purchase and install a new cartridge. Worn cartridges can reduce sound quality and cause premature wear to your records.

Make sure that you fully understand the features and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of different brands, models, and styles of turntable.A basic turntable or record player consists of:


A record platter or plate, which is a record-sized circle on which the vinyl record will sit. The platter rotates to spin the record, and is often covered with an anti-static felt or rubber pad on which the record will sit.
The stylus of the record player is also sometimes referred to as the ""needle,"" and is the component of the record player that contacts the record itself. The stylus is usually housed in a cartridge, which contains the small wiring and coupling mechanism that connects the stylus to the tone arm.
A tone arm can be operated manually or automatically, rotating the stylus onto the record. Good record players will have tone arms that will lift off automatically and return to place when the end of the side is finished playing.
The base of the record player contains the internal circuitry and houses the various components. Ideally, turntable bases are secured on anti-shock feet to keep the record from skipping during play.;
, Turntables can be divided into two basic categories, in terms of the way that they're operated. For the beginner, the difference may be minuscule, but it's important to understand the different machine-styles, depending on the way you intend to use your turntable.


Direct-drive turntables offer consistent machine-operated speeds that will never need adjusted, and allow dual-directional rotation. If you have any interest in analog DJ “scratching,” you need to buy a direct-drive turntable, or you’re going to be disappointed.
Belt-driven turntables isolate the motor to one side of the machine, rotating the platter with an elastic belt. While the belt has a tendency to wear out over time in old turntables, the distance of the motor from the tone arm cuts down on incidental operating noise, making these models whisper-quiet.

, Some turntables are basically a platter and a needle, with few frills or other features. Lots of modern turntables, however, come with a variety of different features that can make a unit more desirable and convenient.


Most turntables should come with a variety of playback speeds, measured by revolutions-per-minute (RPM). Most 12-inch records (large, LP sized) are played at 33 1/3 rpm, while smaller 7-inch singles are played at 45. Old shellac and acetate discs made pre-1950 are usually played at. If you want to play all kinds of records, you'll need to make sure the unit features all these playback speeds.USB ports are a feature on many new turntables, which allow you to direct-line in your record player to your computer and record digital files of your vinyl records. If you've got a big collections of vinyl you want to digitize, these are essential.
Tone-arm cueing systems are available in manual and automatic varieties. Some record players are operated by sliding a switch or pressing a button, which activates the tone arm and drops it gently onto the record, while other record players need to be placed onto the groove manually. Automatic cueing systems are very desirable for beginners, since you won't have to fumble around with the delicate stylus.
Anti-shock stabilization systems are excellent, especially if you want to take your record player anywhere for DJing events, or keep your record player in a heavy-traffic room. There's nothing worse than a skipping record.

, Some cheap turntables are impossible to get apart, meaning that if a stylus breaks you'll have to scrap the whole unit. Because record players will wear out over time and suffer in terms of sound quality, buying a unit that you'll be able to upgrade is a smart choice. Most mid-range units should allow you to customize the belts, stylus, and the platter, if necessary.


Alternatively, if you’re not interested in making a long-term purchase, cheaper and flimsier turntables can be a good budget option. When it wears out, it’ll just be worn out, but you can get some use out of it in the meantime.

, Like anything, more expensive turntables are generally “better” than cheaper varieties. How much better, though, depends on your own preference for sound and your intentions with your turntable. Decide how much you can spend and set a price range accordingly. From sub-$100 to high-end models in excess of $500, there are a variety of perfectly-listenable models.


A DJ looking to jump to analog live sets might be in the market for a more high-end record player capable of putting out the juice, while teenagers looking to drop a needle on dad’s old record collection probably don’t need to break the bank.
If you’ve never purchased a turntable before, don’t overspend. Plenty of record snobs with room-sized collections play their deep cuts on used turntables that sound great. Save your money for vinyl.

, Given the option, going big on a cartridge and spending less on a machine is always the better option. Since the stylus is the part that actual contacts the grooves, it has the most impact on the sound coming out of the speakers. As long as a turntable functions properly, it’ll sound great with a great stylus.


For comparison, a high-quality cartridge only costs about $40. While that might seem expensive for so tiny a component, if you can get away with buying a used machine with a worn out needle for less than a hundred bucks and make it sound brand new, it’s practically a steal.

, Vinyl collecting comes and goes as a hobby, meaning that the market for units, records, and other record-playing equipment can vary widely in price. It's always a good idea to keep an eye on used units to look for deals on high-end equipment that someone else has gotten rid of. If you know how to inspect a record-player, this can be a great option for saving some money.


Ask for a hooked-up demonstration of a record player before you buy it. You should be able to hear it. Bring your own record, so you can be sure of the quality.
Check the rotation of the platter. Platters should spin perfectly flush with the base and shouldn't warble as they spin. You can adjust this, but if you're going to spend money on a new unit, you want to make sure you're paying for what you get.
A record player with worn-out belts will warble and distort sound. Inspect the quality and the pliability of the belts on a belt-driven record player to be sure the unit is solid. Belts should never be cracked and should return to their shape if stretched.

, Record store clerks have an unfair reputation for snark, but try to give them a chance. Many record stores sell turntables or replacement parts, and many of the clerks will be perfectly willing to dish on local options for shopping, their preferred set-up, and other advice. You won’t know until you ask.

, Most of the time, you won’t be able to just buy a turntable, slap a record on the platter and start rocking out after you plug it in. You need to run a turntable through a multi-channel tuner, or at least a good pair of speakers after running it through a pre-amp. Don't forget to figure your stereo into the equation.


Some new or portable turntables come with built-in speakers. What these lack in quality, they make up for in value. You can usually get a portable record player with no need of pre-amp, speakers, or other equipment for less than $200.

, Pre-amplifiers are used to boost the sound of the record player to appropriate volumes. Most record players, new or used, will need to plug into a phono pre-amp to boost the sound, before direct-lining into the sound system. Some models feature built-in pre-armps, but both budget and high-end record players will mostly need to be paired with a pre-amp, which are available at most good electronics stores, for no more than $25-50.Built-in pre-amps make the process of setting up your record player a whole lot easier. It'll involve a lot of extra audio cables to connect your turntable to the pre-amp, then attach the preamp to the receiver.

, Dust is the enemy of a record collection. If you're investing in a record player for the first time, it's important to learn to care for it and your vinyl records properly. Investing in some basic supplies will help you to keep your records clean and your stylus in good working order.A basic kit to go along with your player and your collection should include:


A felt or microfiber record brush
Record cleaning fluid, which is basically a mixture of distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and detergent
Anti-static record sleeves
Anti-static plate pad

, 7-inch vinyl singles played at 45 rpm will sometimes have a much-larger hole in the record than a 12-inch record. These need to be played by slotting a plastic gap spacer over the spindle in the center of the record platter, which will sometimes be included with the unit and sometimes not. It's an easy thing to forget about, but it can be frustrating to end up without one if you want to play some singles. Fortunately, they're available online or at most record stores for a dollar or two.

, A good record player is useless without a tasteful collection of your favorite vinyl to play on it. While budget used vinyl is widely available at second-hand record stores, antique stores, resale shops, online venues, and garage sales, there's also a burgeoning new vinyl market to explore. Vinyl's not dead.


Rocker Jack White's successful boutique label Third Man Records puts on a variety of vinyl novelties, including colored vinyl, scented vinyl, picture-discs, and vinyl that plays backward.
Record Store Day is a worldwide phenomenon, and can be a great way to get out and check out local record stores in your area. In the spring of each year, hundreds of new limited-run releases are made available to the public. It's the crate-digger's Christmas.
Real record collectors are known as crate-diggers and can be found thumbing through the unlabeled boxes in the bottom of libraries, book sales, and garages, looking for unfound gems and diamonds in the rough. Famous collector Joe Bussard (whose collection of 78s is larger than the Smithsonian's) used to pretend to be an exterminator so he had a reason to knock on doors and ask if people had any old records they wanted to get rid of.

Listen to the song and pay close attention to the beat.,
Look at a clock with second hands.",How to Calculate the Beats Per Minute (BPM) of a Song," The easiest way to do this is to close your eyes, relax, and feel the pulse of the song. Tap your foot or your fingers or nod your head to this pulse.

If you have trouble with this, try to isolate the drums from the rest of the instruments and the vocal track. If you are new to this, try first with the instrumental version of the song if it's available, as it'll make things easier.



 

;
, Alternately, use a stopwatch (most phones have them). When you're sure you've got the rhythm of the song happening, count those beats—your head nods, foot taps, or finger snaps—for 15 seconds.


Take the number of beats you counted, and multiply by 4 to get the number of beats in a whole minute.
For example, if you counted 24 beats in 15 seconds, multiply 24 by 4 = 96. The song's tempo is 96BPM. You multiply by four, because 60 seconds divided by 15 seconds = 4.
To increase accuracy, count beats for longer periods of time and calculate the rate accordingly. Using the same song as in the previous example, if you counted for 30 seconds instead of, you might have counted 50 beats instead of 48, which means the tempo is just a little faster: 50 x 2 = 100. (Multiply by two because 60 seconds divided by 30 seconds = 2.)

Choose a level, concrete surface (strong 3/4 inch plywood can make softer surfaces or the ground workable).,
Place a full width piece of 2 by 6, or 2x8 inch wood between a jack and the engine oil pan -- but not extending under the subframe.,
Loosen, but do not remove the upper nuts that connect the mount to the upper mounting-bracket using a ratchet and socket.,
Loosen the lower nuts: But, do not remove them from the bolt attaching them to subframe, through holes in the subframe, using your ratchet, an extension and a socket, for both mounts.

,
The transmission mount: Prepare to remove the third mount much in the same manner as the engine mounts (of a different design) at the rear of the transmission This mount may need to be replaced for backward and forward stability.

,
Remove the mount nuts and replace only one mount at a time: Raising the engine far enough with the jack to get either one of the mounts off, then replace it as follows.

,
Slide the studs on the bottom of the new mount into the holes in the subframe -- and lower the jack a little to seat the engine mounting bracket down lightly onto the stud(s) on the top of the mount, maintaining alignment, so not binding, by tightening nuts and bolts little by little.

,
Install the lower nuts and ""finger tighten"" at the subframe, loosely as before, just by a few threads, to retain the engine positioning.

,
Install the upper nuts and ""finger tighten"", at the engine bracket, as well.,
Install the transmission mount by much the same techniques as the engine mounts.

,
Now, lower the engine a little.,
Finally, torque all the mount attaching nuts and bolts to the manufacturer's recommended number of foot-pounds with a torque wrench and a socket.,

, Raise the jack only until it just begins raising the engine a very little, to mainly support the engine, but not to raise the vehicle at all.

, (If your mounts have a heat shield between the mount and engine, remove the nut or bolt from the bracket holding the heatshield, using your ratchet and socket. Remove the heatshield.) Keeping the nuts loosely screwed on to just a few bolt threads, on the bolts, keeps the mounts aligned until both are loosened -- retained to this same degree, held on loosely, on each side of the engine.

,,,,,,


Install the heat shield and its retaining bolts, if your vehicle is so equipped (on the 3.5-liter engine, for example).

,, Snug the nuts and bolts on all both mounts, at first only ""finger tight"". Then snug them all a little.

, The large nuts and bolts might be torqued to about 45 to 50 foot (13.7 to 15.2 m) pounds. The smaller bolts on the transmission mount are torqued less, perhaps to about 20 to 30 foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) pounds.

, Raise the front of the vehicle enough to remove your jack stands or blocks and such, and lower your New Yorker to the ground.

CDs


Pros : Readily available in stores and online, can be burnt at home with music from iTunes or Napster.,
Vinyl


Pros : Sounds richer on louder sound systems then CDs, has better bass definition.,
Computer


Pros : You can carry a lot of music on a single computer, it is easy to search for songs, and you can always insert a CD if someone brings one for you.",How to Be a Good DJ at a Dance2,"
Cons : CDs are heavy, you will need at least two CD players to easily transition between songs, It can be time consuming to find a single song somewhere among 300 CDs.

,
Cons : Vinyl is also heavy, most record cases can only carry 75 records, you will need two turntables which are quite expensive, a lot of newer music is not available on vinyl except from specialty stores.

,
Cons : If your computer crashes the music will stop until you get it restarted.

The art of reading a crowd is something that will either come to you naturally or you will need to develop over time.",How to Be a Good DJ at a Dance3," The basic principle is this: If you play a song from genre x and the dance floor fills, then you play a song from genre y and the dance floor empties you know that to keep the dance floor packed you need to play more of x than y.


This concept is important! Watch your dance floor! Many DJs fail to impress the crowd because they fail to notice when they clear the dance floor for long periods of time and they don't know what type of music will bring the people back when they finally do notice.
It is also essential to also take note of the type of crowd you are dealing with! Students, parents and/or grown-ups!

"
"
Basic Set Composition : The most basic set composition used by a lot of High School and Middle School DJs is the triangle composition.",How to Be a Good DJ at a Dance4," For this method the DJ will play three similar songs, followed by three different songs. Always sticking to groups of three to allow the crowd to enjoy the change. Here is an example:


First set (Hip Hop): Eminem - Shake That, Akon - Smack That, Kanye West - Stronger
Second set (Dance): Daft Punk - Harder Better Faster Stronger, DJ Alligator - Blow my Whistle, DaRude - Sandstorm

Notice how Kanye West transitions into Daft Punk as Stronger uses samples from Daft Punk.
Use a point where the third song is slower and you do not have an easy transition to insert a slow song, then right after the slow song start bringing them up with something in the middle and moving faster again.



"
"
No Repeats : It is never a good idea to repeat a song twice in a night, this is lazy and unprofessional.,
Don't play everything : You can't blame a cleared dance floor on the person who requested the song, you can only blame yourself for playing it.,
Play it when it's appropriate : If you are planning to do a set of dance music in 30 minutes save the request for Sandstorm until you do it.",How to Be a Good DJ at a Dance5," Be sure to save the more popular songs for later in the night when there are more people there.

, Use your crowd reading to decide if a song will work and when it will work. Although you should try to play as many requests as possible, if you keep everyone dancing and having a good time they will remember you as a good DJ even if you don't play everything they requested.

, Don't feel you need to play a request as the very next song.

Prepare by: setting the parking gear/brake, and blocking rear wheels.,

Remove the belt, pivoting the strong tensioner, releasing tension by pulling forward on the wrench (clockwise).",How to Install a New Belt Tensioner With Pulley for Serpentine Belt on Plymouth Voyager V6 Mid 1990  Early 2000 Years," Raise the hood, allow the engine to cool.Caution: disconnect the battery for safety, avoiding someone turning the starter by mistake.





  Shows tight access to belts because of hoses, tubing... pretty hard to see belts and nuts, etc.

Find a diagram of the belt routing, sometimes on a sticker in the engine compartment, or you can draw one or get one in a book, because it may be tricky getting it back on, routed correctly.;
, There is not enough space for using a regular ratchet or break-over tool with regular shallow socket. Possibly, try a box end wrench/or combination wrench, with a pipe ""cheater handle"" for more leverage. Or, ask at the parts store about the ""rental tool kit"", to get the long, thin handled tool, with a very shallow 15mm (19/32 inch) socket, or possibly using a 15mm ""crow-foot"".Caution: avoid serious finger injury from pinching between a pulley/or such and the tension belt.


Let off tension carefully and gradually: the spring can throw the tool or swing it with some really quick force, if released under tension!Do not cut the belt to remove it! Sudden release is dangerous and may do damage.

Consider trying a new belt, if you have not done so, before a new tensioner. The belt coming off suddenly in rain/puddles may have damaged the tensioner and/or the belt.

Remove the pulley from the tensioner, removing the pulley bolt (counterclockwise); save the existing pulley, washer and bolt to reuse, in case your new tensioner comes without a pulley.

Jack up your car -- carefully, with jack on a solid surface, such as concrete pad or large stepping stone; jack up the car enough to get under the car with a little wiggle room. (You may protect the under car metal where the jack is placed with a 2X4 inch or 2X6 inch, short piece of a wooden stud or joist lumber.)Preferably use steel jack stands, on a solid base; avoid the danger of using heavy concrete blocks -- and never use light, ""cinder"" building blocks, or odd-and-ends of stacked materials.

Make sure you put out a piece of paper for requests.,
Plan a ""set"" (a list of songs to be played) before setting foot inside a DJ booth.,
Load the first selection and, simply enough, press play on the CD player, which will from hereon be referred to as deck 1, to begin playing the song.,

Still using your headphones ensure your songs are perfectly beat matched when you press play on deck 2.,
Wait for the point in the song playing on deck 1 in which you wish to begin mixing the song on deck 2 into the mix.,
Continue to switch back and forth between decks.",How to Be a Dance Music DJ Using CDs," If people want to make requests, they will usually only do it if there is a piece of paper. You might want to do this a given time before you start playing. Other reasons for the sheet of paper are that people might be too shy to talk to the DJ, or they might not have access to the stage to submit a request. As a result there will be patrons upset about not hearing the song they want. This is not necessary if you do not intend to take requests.;
, Choose which songs to play and in which order. Songs should be chosen by Beats Per Minute (tempo), genre, and key. Choose songs that ""flow"" together well. Song selection should be made from a collection of music within the same genre or closely related genres.


You could mix a set entirely composed of Tribal House tracks or mix a set of Classic House and New York House. You should not, however, mix something like house with drum and bass.

, You should ensure that the channel volume for deck 1 is turned up and the master volume is at a comfortable level. If you are using the crossfader ensure it is either in the middle or all the way to deck 1.

, Ensure that the channel volume for deck 2 is either all the way down or if using the crossfader that it is all the way to deck 1, and press play on deck 2. You will be able to hear the music coming from deck 2 in your headphones but it should not be playing to the speakers. This is where the ""mixing"" begins.


Note: If your mixer has ""cue"" buttons or switches ensure they are pressed or flipped on for the channels that you want to hear in your headphones.

, This is called beat matching and involves ensuring the beat from deck 1 and deck 2 are exactly the same speed and lined up. The more you become familiar with the genre or style of music you are playing, the easier it will become.

, A cue point is the exact point in the song that you wish to hear when you press play. Generally you will use the first bass-drum kick as the cue point. Usually, this is done by pressing the cue button found on the player, and then searching with the search buttons or jog wheel until you are right in front of bear. When you tap the cue button you should hear a single beat as long as you don't hold it.

, To do this mix it in only in your headphones well before you actually intend to send it to the speakers and ensure it stays on beat.

, At this point, press play on deck 2; either with the crossfader at 50% (in the middle), or with the crossfader at deck 1, and slowly moving it from deck 1, to the middle, and eventually all the way to deck 2, so that only the song on deck 2 will remain in the mix from that point. You can not hear the change in volume in the headphones, so many DJs wear their headphones with one side off of the ear so that they can hear what is coming out of their monitors, as well as what is going on before the music leaves the mixer.


Note: The use of the crossfader is not necessary. You can also mix using the channel volume levels and completely disable the crossfader.
The period of time that you allow both songs to play simultaneously before cutting the first track is completely up to you. However, most dance music is constructed with a ~1minute intro and and outro and it should be safe to leave the intro of one song mixer over the outro of another for the full minute without worrying about clashing vocals or abrupt changes. This will come with practice and knowledge of your music.

, There are many ""tricks"" and techniques that have not been discussed in this guide, since this is just a basic explanation for complete beginners, or people curious as to what the heck that groovy-looking dude in the DJ booth is so focused on while he is ""in the mix.""

Posting your car for several months, however, could end up costing you a pretty penny., This can be anything from uncommon color combinations to fully-loaded features, or even a souped-up engine under the hood of a classic muscle car. When making a claim that a feature is rare, you should have some kind of proof to back this claim up. Usually, this comes in the form of production numbers, which you can request from the car manufacturer.


History can also play a part in raising the value of your car. For example, if your car was once owned by a famous person, or used in a movie, your car might be worth more than its original estimate.
Do some research so that you know instances where your classic took the spotlight. You could raise your car's esteem in the eyes of buyers if you mention it was featured in a classic TV show, movie, or automotive exhibition., While your classic car might be desirable to collectors in the region you live, it will be less exotic in your region, as it was likely produced and distributed there. In a foreign market, however, where your car will likely be even rarer. However, your classic car will need to be a worthy value to justify the expense of transporting a car internationally.


You might also want to look into the fuel and emission standards for the country you are considering advertising your car in. Even avid collectors might pass on your vehicle if their country's laws disallow them from driving the vehicle.
For example, if your fixer-upper classic is only worth an estimated $20,000, many buyers might not consider it worthwhile to pay international shipping fees, which can range as high as $5,000., While you never know when an interested buyer will make a bid on your classic car, generally speaking, the summer months bode best for selling. Winter months can be especially slow, as many people will have budgeted money for holiday expenses, leaving less free cash available to buy a classy set of wheels.


While selling your car in the off-months of fall and winter is possible, you may have to adjust your price lower than you had planned.
Economic factors, like fuel shortages or increased gas prices, can also influence the sale of your car. You can improve your changes by selling while car related expenses, like gas, are low., Now that you’ve decided on a venue or agent, like you would have with an auto consignment, you should have your car listed with photos, a description, and a list of special features that might interest prospective buyers. Be as honest as possible in your listing to promote honesty throughout your transaction.


Although honesty is important, you shouldn’t feel like you have to explain every ding or age-related flaw on the vehicle. Classic cars are expected to have some age and use related deterioration.
You may have to pay some fees to have your vehicle listed on a site that sells classic cars. As these differ greatly according to site, you should investigate your particular venue for listing and budget for the cost.
Vehicle auctions are popular places to sell your classic car. Each auction house will have its own fee system. In some cases, this might be a buyer's commission, in other cases this may be a seller's commission, where you'll have to pay a percentage of the money made on your car sale., Many buyers will want to see your classic car with their own eyes, and may even bring along an automotive expert or automotive savvy friend to help assess your vehicle. Have information on hand about the car’s history, and answer any questions your buyer has as honestly as possible.


When someone calls about the car, arrange a time when he can come evaluate the car in person. Even the best photos of your vehicle will not be a perfect substitute for seeing the real thing in person.
If you are uncomfortable meeting a prospective buyer alone, you should invite a friend to keep you company at the time of the inspection. You could also call a friend and let him know when you will be showing the car. This way he can be on the lookout for your text or call should any problems arise.
It's always a good idea to get information up front from prospective buyers. A major question you should ask before meeting: ""Will you be viewing the car alone, or should I expect a guest to come with you?""

, Some buyers will want to test drive your classic car to see how it handles and listen to the engine. Be sure you verify the buyer’s insurance and driver’s license before even considering allowing a potential buyer to drive your classic. An accident while on a test drive could leave you with a bunch of scrap instead of a tidy sum gained from selling your classic car.Under no circumstances should you allow a potential buyer to test drive your car alone. Even with collateral, like a credit card, it's unlikely that if the car is stolen the collateral will make up for the loss of your classic car.
You may want to consider choosing the test drive route for your car. Depending on the kind of classic car you have, you might want a good straightaway where the test driver can accelerate to evaluate the engine.
Scenic test drives, like those you might see on car advertisement commercials, can make your car more appealing to buyers. Winding roads, lakeside or seaside routes, and picturesque boulevards can help your buyer visualize himself driving (and owning) your classic car.

, Once a buyer has checked out your car and decided he is interested, the negotiation process begins. There are many negotiation tactics you can use while deciding on the final price of your classic, you should have a firm idea of the upper and lower limits of the range you are willing to accept.Think of a sales pitch for your vehicle before meeting with interested parties. You can tailor your pitch to those interested by asking, ""What interests you most about this classic car?"" Then you can highlight features related to this interest.
A personal endorsement from you will likely carry weight as well. Mentioning the car's history of reliability, its performance, or even its appeal to other collectors can garner even more interest among buyers.
You should expect to be bargained down at least somewhat from your asking price. This gives the buyer the illusion of a better deal. Begin with your asking price slightly above what your car is valued at.
Don't price your car too much more than the estimated value. This might scare off potential buyers, or it could lead buyers to thinking that you are over-inflating the price for a purpose - like for the purpose of being bargained down.

, Now that everything agreed upon, you’ll have to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the new owner and fill out associated paperwork to make the sale official. Depending on your region or country, the requirements for transferring ownership may vary slightly, but generally you’ll need to:


Complete the bill of sale.
Sign over the title
Fill out the Release of Liability
Submit necessary forms to your state DMV
Provide copies of maintenance records.You should black out any personal information that is included in the records/history of the car that you provide the new owner.

, Some classic cars are valuable purely due to rarity, but more often than not, a defining characteristic in addition to rarity makes a classic desirable to collectors. You’ll have to do some research into your classic car to find out just why collectors might want to buy your car. Then you should restore these original features as best as you can. Some characteristics that might set your classic car apart include:


An elegant, unique body
A large, powerful engine
A plush, comfortable interior
Luxury features, like wooden paneling, Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth, like a microfiber cloth, and specially formulated car-washing soap to do this. Park out of the sun so that your car does not dry too quickly before you and wet, lather and rinse your car. Then:


Wet your car with water. If your home has issues with hard water, you may want to use distilled water to wet, wash, and rinse your car.
Add your soap to water in a bucket. Agitate the water to spread the soap throughout it.
Lather up your cloth and soap up the car thoroughly. Be sure to get the wheels, undercarriage, and all nooks and crannies as best you can.
Rinse the car and make sure to get all soap washed off. Then you should hand dry your car with a microfiber cloth or chamois., Appearances matter when you’re selling your classic car. Potential buyers are likely going to try to bargain you down in price using any reasoning they can, and in your case, this might be a poorly maintained exterior. A coat of wax can go a long way toward making your old classic look like it just came off the assembly line. Buy your wax from your local automotive store and then you should:


Wax your car on a cool day out of the sun. Hot days cause the wax to dry immediately, making buffing the wax and getting the best shine difficult. You should aim for days between 55° and 85° F (13°C and 30°C).Follow the instructions that came with your wax. In most cases, this involves using a foam applicator to apply the wax in small amounts to the body of your car. Always use less wax; you can add more if you need to.
Apply the wax in circular motions evenly.
Buff the body of your car, if you desire.
Allow the wax to rest as directed by the wax directions.
Polish your car with a microfiber cloth., You’ll want the interior of your car to be as clean as humanly possible to get the best price. Vacuum dust and crumbs, wipe down the dashboard, spray out your air vents with compressed air, and make the interior look as though it were new.


Many classic cars have leather upholstery. To make these look fresh and bright, you may want to look into how to clean leather car seats.
Many automotive stores sell specialty automotive wipes that work well at cutting grease and buildup that accumulates on the dashboard and console of cars. These might help your detailing work go faster.
For classic cars that need serious TLC, or if you feel unconfident in your ability to safely and correctly detail your classic car, you may want to pay a professional to detail your car for you., If your car is in prime condition and full working order, this can significantly raise the value of your classic car. The best way to prove this to prospective buyers is by having your car inspected by a professional. A full, comprehensive inspection should take around an hour, and will generally cost somewhere between $75 and $100.


Though this might seem like an unnecessary expense, proof that your car is in near mint condition could add thousands of dollars’ worth of value to the vehicle., Be all inclusive in your classic car’s photography. Leave nothing out. Even if you are hesitant to capture some of the rougher areas of your car on camera, many buyers expect some amount of wear and tear on classic cars. Honestly showing the true condition of your car will encourage honesty with potential buyers.


Include well-lit pictures under the hood, showing the condition of the engine.
If you have access to a car lift, put the car up in the air and take detailed undercarriage photos.
Although you should be comprehensive with your car photos, try not to be repetitive."

Before buying a restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer, it is important to determine if it is really right for you.,
Those who are looking for a SUV which can take a beating for several years may want to consider a newer model.,
Find a possible vehicle.,
Evaluate possible restored vehicles, some restorations are better than others.

,
Check for rust, these vehicles are known for having rust problems which is one reason they have become rare in some parts of the country.,
Fresh paint on the frame directly under the driver's door is a sign that someone was trying to cover up a rust problem.

,
Check the body with a magnet.,
Take the screws out of the door trim strips that hold the carpet down and pull the carpet back.,
Most of these vehicles will have been repainted because the factory paint was defective, not a deal breaker but check for the quality of the finish.

,
Check under the vehicle for oil leaks, the front and rear engine seals, transmission, and transfer case are problem areas on these vehicles.

,
Take the top of of the air cleaner and look for oil.,
Purchase the vehicle.",How to Buy a Restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer," As the production of this vehicle was ended in the early 90s, you are looking at a car which is at least two decades old that Jeep dealers no longer stock parts for and haven't in over a decade.


Grand Wagoneers are classics, and are neat to look at, and fun to drive, but they never had the greatest reputation for reliability even back when they were new. They also get terrible gas mileage because they were built in an era when gas prices were measured in cents per gallon rather than dollars. Expect around 11 mpg city 13 highway.;
, In contrast, individuals who have a special bond with this particular model will typically be ""gentler"" with the vehicle, and will not require it to perform vigorously. This makes the restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer a viable choice for these customers.

,


Talk to Jeep retailers, mechanics, and restorers. Educate them about your desire to purchase a restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer. Chances are high that one of these individuals should be able to point you in the proper direction. In addition, individuals who are exhibiting their vehicles at classic car shows and members of Jeep car clubs may be able to provide you with the name and contact information of someone who is interested in selling their restored Jeep Grand Wagoneer.

",How to Buy a Classic Volvo,"


Volvos are available in station wagons, sedan models, SUVs and compact sedans as well as coupes.
Volvo vehicles have high safety standards and generally get good gas mileage.
The oldest Volvos came off the assembly line in 1927, and the model is referred to as the Volvo �V 4.
Because Volvo Group was one of the largest commercial vehicle manufacturers in the world before it was bought out in 1998 by Ford, Volvos can be found all over the world. Your particular vehicle search may extend that far if you cannot find your vehicle in your home country.
A few safety milestones that may influence your purchase include the 1944 safety cage addition, the 1956 windscreen washers addition, 1957 addition of seatbelts, or by 1972 the 3-point safety belt was added to both the front and the rear of the car.
Older models are boxy and described as ""bricks."" Sportier models did not come until after the 1980s.;
, Start with the personal car ads, and if you don't have luck there, look at the dealer advertisements. Purchasing locally will save you time and expense as far as shipping or delivery because you can just go to the home or dealership to pick up the car.

, Your Volvo may be sitting on a local lot just waiting for you, but it may not make it into the newspaper ad. Pull up local car dealership sites that sell used, and plug in the make, model and year that you are looking for.

, Most gas stations or convenience stores have racks located by the door with these magazines of area cars and trucks for sale.

, An Internet search will give you the widest variety of cars to choose from in terms of year, color and other specifics.


Car and Classic, a British website at http://www.carandclassic.co.uk/list/102/, lets you plug in the make, model, year, area and more into your search.
Collector Car Ads also has a wide selection of vintage Volvos at http://www.collectorcarads.com/make/Volvo. Listings include year, type and other vehicle details. They also show photographs with the listings.

,, The Kelley Blue Book is a trusted vehicle valuation source, and you can either purchase the hard copy book or look up the vehicle online at http://www.kbb.com/.

, Most advertising sites are only the middleman, so any negotiations and details to iron out should be discussed directly with the owner of the vehicle, be it an individual or a car lot.


Determine if the price is negotiable. If it is, offer a fair price that is under the current asking price.
Iron out how you are going to obtain the car. Is the seller going to ship or deliver it? Do you need to be driven or fly to the car's location and drive it back cross country? Do you need to have it shipped overseas? All of these questions should be taken into consideration and worked into the price.
Determine the timing and method of payment.

  Negative Terminal

First (most important step) is the diagnosis.,

Disconnect the negative terminal at the battery.,

Remove the accessory belt by relieving the tension on the belt.,

Now remove black dust boot from the top of the alternator (just wiggle it back off where it is).,

Remove the three bolts holding the alternator to the accessory bracket and the electrical connector on the side of the alternator.,




Take the vacuum lines off of the fuel pressure regulator, and both of the Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC) Valves.,

Remove the white clip from the arm of the valve.,

The lines for the power steering fluid run right where you need your wrench to go, so be VERY careful not to bend these lines too much, or even break them or you may be making an additional repair!,

Get the white clip for the new valve, and insert it in the hole that the old one came out of.,
Put everything back on that you took off!,
Do a second check to make sure that you have everything back together that you took apart, and that all of your tools are out of the engine compartment.",How to Replace an Intake Manifold Runner Control Valve 96 Ford Windstar," Don't skip this step as you might replace something that isn't broken. There may not even be a problem with your valves (i.e. the vacuum isn't even reaching them to be able to shut them). These valves, if good, should close with very little vacuum, and should also hold the vacuum when applied with a vacuum pump. The default position (engine off, no vacuum) for these valves is open. Once the engine is started (and vacuum is being applied) these valves will close until wide open throttle, when vacuum is absent.
, DO NOT skip this step under any circumstances. If you want to know the why, there is plenty of literature out there and plenty of reasons, the best being YOUR SAFETY. Once it's removed, secure it somewhere that you are sure it won't come into contact with the terminal again unintentionally (picture)., Good luck trying to get a socket on this beast. I'm sure they have a nice shiny tool that makes this easier, but I used the box end of a wrench to get on this. Pull the wrench toward the front of the vehicle until enough tension is off the belt to remove it from the alternator pulley. Doing this with a wrench does require a good bit of strength. If you can't get it to move, or don't think you would be able to put enough power behind it to get it to turn, talk to one of your local parts store to see if you can get your hands on that tool. They may even have it on a loaner program so you wouldn't actually have to buy one., Take off the nut hiding under there, and lay the wire to the side. Thread this nut back in place once you have the wire off so it doesn't get lost somewhere., The connector was already taken out in this picture, but top arrow pointing to the right is where it was. And just in case you're curious, there's a picture here that shows what it looks like without the alternator in there., Now, swing the whole harness out of the way. Remove the electrical connector on the front valve. Just squeeze the connector at the back (where the arrow is on the picture with the connector off) and pull away from the valve., You won't be reusing this clip, as a new one should come with your new valve. Remove the two bolts holding the valve onto the engine. This is a little tricky, and where the u-joint comes into play., Again, if you're curious, I've added a picture with the valve out., Insert the arm of the new valve into the clip, and insert the two bolts that hold it on., Start with the electrical connector for the IMRC Valve, then the alternator, then the vacuum lines for the valves and fuel pressure regulator, and finally, the accessory drive belt. Just follow all of these steps in reverse, and you'll be taking it for a test drive in no time!, Start up the vehicle, and verify that both valves are now closed. Having an assistant available to start the vehicle while you watch the valves could be helpful, but it will be an obvious change from open to closed. Once that your are satisfied that both valves are closing when you turn the vehicle on, close the hood and take it for a test drive and feel the difference!"

You will be removing the passenger side only., Face your front windshield and look for a series of small, round, plastic caps just beneath where the wipers are at rest. You will remove the first four only - counting from the passenger side toward the center., Remove each of the four screws with a medium sized Phillips screwdriver., Locate the ""under hood"" portion of the cowl you are working with. Facing the engine from the front of the car, it will be all the way in the back, on the left side., They are set in what appear to be plastic washers of the same color. These plastic washers have squeezable bottoms so they are able to be popped in and out quite easily., This may require you to push on the bottom of the screw to make it lift., As the bottom portion is squeezed together, you will be able to push the entire washer, and screw, up through the hole. Keep the washer/screw sets in a safe place., It may be a little sticky. Note: It will still be on the car. You are just moving it out of your way., This is a water guard that covers the cabin air filter. Pull the handle and it will give way., Install it ""posts"" side up. (The plastic stand offs point upward)., Each of the three hooks will line up the same way they did before.,,,,,"
"
The easiest upgrade is intake.,
Another simple mod on the Focus is exhaust.,
A good moderately difficult install is lowering springs.,
A great upgrade is lighting.,
One final upgrade I suggest is an underdrive pulley.",How to Make Minor Performance Upgrades to Your Ford Focus," In order to install a cold air intake on the Focus, the battery must be removed to run the pipe underneath. Begin by taking the cables off the battery and lift it from the battery box. Then unscrew the 3 bolts holding the box in, and remove it from the car, unclipping the cables from the back and side. This will give access to the snorkel pipe. Unscrew the snorkel from the plastic piece above the grill. Loosen the clamp on the intake pipe over the throttle body. The intake filter box will just pop out, so pull up hard. Then remove the snorkel. Remove the MAF sensor via 2 torx screws. Fit all parts of the cold air intake together to make sure they will work. Fit the MAF sensor into the new intake pipe. Fit the throttle body elbow and clamp over the throttle body but do not tighten. Fit the second pipe without the filter on it yet to the first pipe via straight elbow piece, and attach PVC hose from this pipe to the fitting on the valve cover. This piece is critical if you value a long life for your motor. Crawl under the car and attach and secure tightly the intake filter. Go back and tighten all clamps. Reinstall the battery and you're finished.;
, I recommend buying your own muffler and take it to a shop and have them install it with piping. Buying your own muffler will save you 200-300 dollars as shops overcharge for parts.

, A good rule to remember here is you get what you pay for. Always buy name brand and not cheap eBay junk; however not all eBay items are junk. Just use common sense. If a part is 90% cheaper than the normal part, its probably a badly designed knock-off. Remember to do only one side at a time, so if you forget how something went, you can refer to the other side that's still intact. For the front springs, remove the wheels and set the car on jack stands. Remove the brake line from the strut and unscrew the tie rod end link from the bracket. Unscrew the bolt that keeps the strut in tight on the rear of the knuckle. Take your foot and push down on the brake disc until the damper pops out of the knuckle. Unscrew the 3 bolts on top of the strut tower. The whole strut assembly should fall out for you. Compress the spring with an appropriate spring compressor, using EXTREME caution. Unscrew the bolt on top, removing the top assembly. Remove the spring. Compress the new spring and put it on the damper and make sure the slots are lined up. This is VERY important! Then put the strut back together and uncompress the spring. Installation is reverse of removal. Do the same for the other side. The rears are simple! Just take off the wheels and compress the springs and pull them out. Make sure on installation that the notches are all lined up.

, Taillights are simple, just a few screws and a thumbscrew. Just swap the wires. Headlights are just as easy. 3 bolts on top and one underneath. I recommend just leaving that one out. It doesn't hold it in any more than the 3 up top. Swap in the new headlights and connect the wiring connector.

, There has been debate on this topic, but personal research has shown a mild response increase. Undo the serpentine belt from the crankshaft pulley, and remove the bolt. Put the new pulley on and install a shorter belt.

",How to Buy a Classic Jeep,"


The oldest type of Jeep to find would be the prototype Bantam BRC, which was originally created by American Bantam Car Company for the United States and Allied armies in World War II.
When the American Bantam Car Company was deemed too small of a company to mass produce the vehicles, the original designs were turned over to two different companies to make their own vehicles. Willys-Overland made the Model MB, and Ford built the Model GPW.
Amphibious Jeeps are known as model GPA.
The CJ series stands for Civilian Jeep, and these were first produced in 1945, although war-era Jeeps were able to be purchased after the war because of the amount of surplus vehicles available.;

",How to Buy a Classic Jaguar,"


Jaguars are British-assembled, they are now part of the Indian subsidiary company Tata Motors. The company was founded in 1922 under the name Swallow Sidecar Company. The name of the company was changed from Swallow Sidecar Company to Jaguar following World War II because of the stigma of the initials SS.






While under the Swallow Sidecar name, the first models were the SS 90 and SS 100.






Their earlier vehicles include 1949's XK 120, which evolved into the XK 140 and XK 150. Also notable is the XKE from 1961 and 1948's streamlined Mark V and the XK120 sports car from that same year.

Buy the car.",How to Buy a Classic Car," If it will be used as a daily driver, there is no need to find a ""show condition"" vehicle. If you plan on entering classic car competitions, you'll have to find something with its original parts and spend slightly more. Additionally, you will have different car requirements if you want it for romantic weekends or family outings versus speeding down the highway. Whether you would like to use it year round is another factor to consider. Take all factors into account when deciding on a car to help you find the best one for you., First get a general idea of the car you want. Based on what you’ll be using it for, maybe you’ve decided to go with a Corvette. Once you know the model you are interested in, narrow it down to 2 or 3 years (e.g., Corvette 1963-1965). This will help with your search. To further narrow it down, research what changes were made each year to find what best suits your needs. Then decide on the exact make of the car that you desire., Once you have an idea of which classic car you want, you can find an owner’s club for that type of car. With an owner’s club, you will be able to meet with enthusiasts, learn a lot, and find cars for sale at reasonable prices. Check with local classic car clubs for any people who own, or have owned the type of classic you are interested in. They may be able to help you determine what to buy and what to avoid.Look at Practical Classics or Classic & Sports Car magazines for lists of owner’s clubs.

, There are many websites that sell classic cars. As with any online purchases, be sure to exercise caution when shopping online. Try to see the car in person before buying it whenever possible.


Before buying a car from a website, check reviews of the website through independent organizations such as Consumer Reports or the Better Business Bureau. If a deal feels shady or too good to be true, look elsewhere; many scams happen in online sales, and you don't want to risk making a mistake with a purchase of this magnitude.

, This will help you to make an informed choice. It is a good idea to spend at least a month shopping around before you buy your classic car. If you are looking for a specific model, depending on its rarity, you might need to be patient for one to come on the market. Start by looking locally because it will be easiest to buy a car in your area. This will also make it simple for you to see the car before buying it. Find local sources through your car club, car museums, classic car dealerships, newspaper classifieds, or local online listings, such as your city’s Craigslist.

, This is important because classic cars come at a wide range of prices. It can be easy to fall in love with a car that you can’t afford. By determining your budget ahead of time, you can keep yourself from overspending. Try to avoid going into debt if at all possible. You don’t want to enjoy your car but lose your house!To plan a budget, look at your monthly income and expenses and determine how much you have leftover. Take into account money you have in savings and find a reasonable budget that won’t require you to miss out on other important parts of life, like eating, for example!

, It is very difficult to make money by investing in cars, but rare cars are your best chance of doing so. The less that were made, the more value it will have. To find out whether it is especially rare, check with the manufacturer to find out how many were made., This will help keep its maintenance to a minimum, but be prepared to pay a premium price. A fully reconditioned, professionally restored car might have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in time and parts, and will have every nut and bolt examined. A restored car will perform as well, if not better, than it did when it was new. At this point the car will only require normal maintenance, although it is likely you will want to keep it as perfect as possible and maintain it to the highest possible standards.

, Research what problem areas the vehicle may have and check if the problem has been resolved. For example, many European classics have electrical problems, so check that the components are in working order. The more you know about your car of interest, the better decision you will make when buying it., This is not only to make sure that you like it, but also to test for any problems. Look for anything out of the ordinary and pay special attention to how it sounds. Squeaking, grinding, and clunking are not good signs! Make sure to get permission from the dealer or owner before driving it.If you don’t know a lot about cars, bring someone along for the ride who is an expert, like a friend from your owner’s club.

, They may be able to tell if it has been in an accident and whether the engine, transmission, and other vital components are original. This will alter the value of the vehicle. They will determine a price by looking at the value of comparable cars that are sold to ensure a fair market value. They are experts in the car market and highly knowledgeable about classic cars. Having a car professionally appraised is important when making a big investment.Look for an appraiser that adheres to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice to find someone reputable.
Search online using the name of your city and the keywords ""classic car appraisal"" to find an appraiser near you.

, Make sure it is actually registered to the seller. This will help you to avoid fees and avoid buying a stolen car. You can check with the DMV or vehiclehistory.gov by the car’s VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), which can be found on its registration. There is usually a small fee of a couple of dollars to check the title., Does it have its original parts? What damage is there? Each little repair will quickly add up. Look for welding marks, which can signal a clip job. Pay attention to the quality of the paint and notice any dents or misaligned panels. Missing trim and odd smells are another cause for concern. You need to carefully examine any car before you buy it., The lower the mileage, the less it has been used, the more valuable it is. There is nothing wrong with high-mileage cars, but low-mileage is important if you want your car to be an investment. Additionally, low-mileage cars often require less upkeep than high-mileage cars. But since they are in newer condition, they will likely cost you more.A low-mileage car would be one with 40,000 miles, for example, while a high-mileage car might have 200,000 miles.
Be aware of mileage scams. Some sellers try to trick buyers by claiming a car has lower miles than it actually has. Any car that has been around for at least 15 years is likely to have significant mileage. Since the odometer can be changed, pay attention to other parts of the car such as the carpets, headliner, gearshift knob, spare wheel, tires, and brake pads. If these have significant wear or damage but the mileage is under 50,000, then something is askew. Low-mileage classics are very rare but are often faked, so be sure to look for the telltale signs., This will provide you with valuable information on the car to make sure it has not been stolen and to check how many people owned the car previously. This can be completed online using a service such as Carfax. Simply enter the car’s VIN or license plate and find out its history, including accidents, recalls, usage, damage, and registration. This will cost around $40, but many dealers offer them for free.Keep in mind that classic cars will generally have multiple owners. This is to be expected, but if your owners are keeping the car for less than a year or two, this could indicate a problem. For example, for a forty-year-old car, between five and ten owners is perfectly acceptable, but over twenty would be cause for concern. Ideally, two owners per decade is a good rule of thumb.

, Car inspection companies and car repair shops offer inspections. A thorough inspection will be conducted by an expert who will look at the car’s exterior, engine, brakes, tires, radiator, belts, hoses, and fluids. This is an especially important step if you are not a mechanic. This can help you to avoid buying a car with any major problems. If you are buying the car from a dealer, it will likely come with an inspection.National Auto Inspection Services offer inspections for $220.To get an inspection specific to classic cars, find a list of inspectors at fossilcars.com/resources/classic-car-inspections. It is a good idea to get a classic car inspected by a specialist that knows exactly what to look for with classics. You don’t need to worry about finding an inspector specifically for your car’s make or model, but finding one specifically for classics will help.

, Expect some rust, but if an entire panel is rusted, this is cause for concern. Significant rust means the car has not been properly maintained. It can also indicate more serious problems with the car. A little rust around the edges is to be expected in an old car, but significant rust means you should look elsewhere., Check that the VIN on the car's title matches the official VIN tag. If they do not match then the vehicle may have been in a severe accident, stolen, or counterfeit.VIN numbers were first used in 1954 and the numbers and letters used, as well as the length, varied by manufacturer until they became standardized in the 80s.You may be able to locate VIN or serial numbers on a sticker on the driver's side door, on the firewall, or elsewhere in the engine compartment.
Check the engine, transmission, and rear axle to make sure they have the same VIN number as well. The last six numbers of the VIN should be on the engine, and matching dates should be on the transmission and rear axle., A classic car will cost a lot more than its original price. Plan to spend up to seven times more for insurance than you would with an average car. Storing the car can also cost a lot if you don’t have your own garage. Storage in an auto facility or motor club can cost $500+/month. Classic cars generally require a lot of upkeep, and unexpected repairs can cost $1000+. Make sure to factor all costs into its price so that you have enough money to maintain your car.Be prepared to pay more for parts. If you buy something rare, be prepared to pay more not only for the car, but also for its parts. In many cases you'll have to get parts custom-made, which can be very expensive. You may also be able to buy used parts from someone who is ""chopping"" up a similar model. You can check online auctions for general availability of such parts., It is not uncommon for new classic car buyers to overspend. A fair price needs to be calculated based on the car's age, the condition it's in, how rare it is, and what features it has. Find the market value of your car at the National Automobile Dealers Association at nada.org., If you need to finance the car, you will likely have trouble finding a bank or lending institution that is willing to help because they don’t understand the value of an object that is several decades old. But there are some companies that will help, such as J.J. Best Banc & Company and Woodside Credit. You will need to make a down payment of 10-30% and will pay interest ranging from 5-10%. The loan is often for 10-12 years and you can often build in the cost of warranty. The insurance and car title will need to be in the owner’s name. You can transfer the car title at the DMV.Of course, if you have the money to pay for it, you can simply buy it with your own money. It is always preferable to avoid going into debt. Save up for it and then pay by check.
Another option is to lease a classic car if you can’t afford to own it. This is advantageous because if the market changes and the car’s value decreases, it won’t affect you.

Have someone quiz you.,
Practice.",How to Get Perfect Pitch," Choose a basic note that you wish to learn. Start with something simple, like an A or C. Play the note over and over until you begin to memorize its sound by rote. This is the raw form of memorization—learning how a particular note sounds and absorbing as much of its auditory properties as you can., Instead of simply hearing the sound of the note, try “seeing” or even “feeling” it. Does the note evoke a certain emotion or sensation in you? Does it remind you of a color or give you an impression of some type of scene? Focus on isolating these characteristics of the note. Your pitch will begin to improve once you start to develop a creative musical memory.Musicians commonly refer to this type of practice as “colorful listening,” or making use of other sensory features to cement a sound’s place in the listener’s memory.
As a broad example, minor notes often have the effect of eliciting feelings of melancholy in listeners, whereas major swells are linked with impressions of excitement, joy and triumph.

, Think of other, non-musical sounds that the note reminds you of. Making associations with like sounds can help solidify the tonal structure of the note in your mind; a low E or F flat note, for example, may conjure images of an ocean liner sounding its foghorn.Musicians who use this mnemonic device allow notes to form vivid depictions in their minds, making them more memorable as a result.

, Distinguishing pitch largely involves being able to tell which notes have a higher or lower frequency than others, so learn to recognize the same notes in different octaves in addition to the general sound of the note itself, as well as the sharp and flat modes of each note. If you familiarize yourself with these variations, you’ll have a better ear for when the note has been hit exactly and when it is a little too high or low.”Sharp” refers to notes that are roughly a half step higher than their base frequency, while “flat” notes are perceived as slightly low.
Many mistakes in musical pitch occur because of a lack of familiarity with a note’s deviations.

, Once you’ve begun learning the various notes in a scale, pick one note to discern among others. Have a friend play notes in no particular order up and down a keyboard, and keep your ear primed for the note you’re listening for. Call out whenever you think you hear the note and verify whether you were right by checking the location of the key that was pressed.Focus on learning one or two notes at a time. This way you won’t get overwhelmed, and it will make learning other keys and modes easier later on., As a more advanced variation of the previous exercise, have your friend slowly play notes at random and try to name each note as it is played. This is an extremely challenging form of training that requires you to have a practical knowledge of the sonic profile of each note. Challenging yourself to identify notes on the spot will greatly reinforce your recall.Add sharp and flat notes once you’re able to call out each note with continual accuracy.

, A chord is a complex, harmonious sound comprised of several notes being played together in a complementary key. With a sophisticated ear, you should be able to name not only a given chord being played but also the individual notes that make it up. Practice chord work the way you would pick out single notes on a keyboard, calling out a chord when you hear it or recognizing different chords that are being played erratically.Chord recognition is a tough task that can typically only be accomplished by more experienced ears, as the listener must be able to isolate the single notes from a chord as well as identify the chord itself.

, Pay close attention to the everyday sounds around you. Many odd noises will closely resemble clearer, more sustained musical notes. The next time you hear a car horn, a stray shout or the chime of an alarm, try to place it as near a note as you can in your mind. This will be easier if you’ve been making mental associations between musical notes and non-musical sounds, and will enhance your working knowledge at the same time.Take a tour of your house and identify the notes produced by your cell phone, the buttons on the microwave, the garbage disposal, clanking silverware, etc.
The term “note” usually refers to a focused sound that maintains a consistent frequency, therefore there are always notes being generated in day-to-day life, even if they’re outside of a musical context., Strengthen the connection between the ear and distinct tones by replicating notes using your voice. Take a few minutes a day to sing a selection of notes as accurately as you can, trying to form a clear “image” of the note in your mind and match it closely. Just as you’ve come to be able to recognize notes as they’re played, you should now attempt to apply that skill in reverse, producing a designated note on command.Don’t be embarrassed if you can’t sing. Practice alone to get rid of the nerves of singing in the presence of others.
Learning to sing the right pitch also serves as a kind of fundamental vocal training.

, Because pitch is not a concrete characteristic of sound but of the ear that perceives it, it can be helpful to acquaint yourself with the different ways a note may sound when played on different instruments. Each instrument will feature unique vibrational traits that influence the tonal quality of the notes it produces, but the notes themselves will remain distinguishable, as they are defined by their basic frequency and sound the same regardless of tone.Play the same scale on a piano, a guitar, a flute and a violin and consider the similarities and differences in the way each note is formed., Instruct your friend to recite a series of random notes, then sing each note back to them. Quicken the pace of the call-and-response as you become more proficient at producing notes. Increase the difficulty of the exercise by incorporating flat and sharp variations.


Keep an electronic tuner on hand to give you instant feedback on the accuracy of the notes you’re trying to hit.

, Call upon your newfound knowledge of the sonic properties of musical notes to improve your technical mastery. Drilling yourself on picking out musical notes will be of little use if you don’t apply that knowledge in musical creation or performance.There is no substitute for lots and lots of practice.In addition to exercising your ear, starting drilling yourself on observing the progression of notes in songs on the radio, mentally “playing” sheet music and attempting to play songs by ear on an instrument after only a listen or two."

You always want to make sure your guitar is in tune, no matter what you play. You can use a tuner to get in the desired tuning. For these instructions, it is assumed you are in E Standard tuning.

Do your homework.,
Ask yourself what you need an item for.,
Make a list of what you need.",How to Save Money on Music Equipment1," One surefire way to spend way too much money is to listen to the guys in the store. Most of them are music experts and get way too excited about little things you won't need, making you think it's better. To avoid this, research some good brands that are still quite cheap. Write them down on a list (see below). Remember to stick within your budget too, don't waste all your money. Say you're looking for a guitar––some recommendations for things to watch out for include:


Guitars. Gibson and Fender are good makes, although they're quite pricey. If you don't want to spend the extra cash, maybe settle for an Ibanez or Epiphone. These makes tend to be good quality and not way too much money. Stagg is another cheap but good make.
Amps. Diezel, VHT, Soldano, and Bogner are all good brands but like Gibson guitars, they can be crazy expensive. Randall or THD can be a nice alternative, they're good amps and quite a step down in price. Epiphone Valve Jr is quite a cheap amp and doesn't do much, although it's of good quality and lasts a long time.
Straps. You don't need a crazy expensive strap, just a plain one will do. Go for one that's quite strong.
Strings. Slinky stings are good and can be found very cheap online or in some music stores. Bass strings tend to be more expensive as they're a fair bit thicker.;
, If you're only playing in your bedroom, then there's no point buying equipment that can blow the roof off a concert. A fairly simple way to save money is to only buy what you'll need. If you're just playing at home, a 10-15 watt amp will do you just fine. Obviously, if you're playing live, you'll need something a bit bigger. This goes for instruments too, a Pearl drum kit performs great live but for home, something simpler and smaller will do.

, One of the reasons that most people spend more money than they need is that they go to a store and buy everything in sight, mostly because they're unsure what they're really after and the sales pitch is irresistible. From guitars to amps to mics, there is plenty of gear for sale that you may never use. To avoid buying gear you don't need, make a list of everything that you need now. That means don't bother buying the studio equipment in case you get famous ten years down the line.


Write down the instrument you want. List any other bits to go with it such as a tuner, a strap, a case, an amp and microphones. Anything else is to be considered extraneous to your current needs.

"
"
Set a budget.",How to Save Money on Music Equipment2," Before you start splashing out all your money from last payday, set yourself a nice budget. There are two ways to do this:


You could take the list of all the things you wanted and set a budget for each item. This will stop you from spending too much on something little.

The other way is to set a budget for everything overall. This will stop you from going bankrupt. The only downside of this is that you may find yourself thinking ""I'll spend more on the guitar and even it out by buying a cheap amp"". That could leave you with loads of items of varying quality.

"
"
Shop around.,
Try before you buy.",How to Save Money on Music Equipment3," At one store, drum heads could be £90. Note the store and price but look around at other stores to see if you can find them cheaper. Chances are, you'll find them cheapest online. That being said, don't jump on the internet every time you need something. By the time your stuff is shipped out to you, it's probably already been bashed and smashed around. Most of the time, you can't return once you've bought online.


Bring the online price in to the retailer and ask them to match it. If they really want your business, they may try. However, be understanding that in many cases, this cuts right into their bottom line, so don't be pushy.

, Before you buy a t-shirt, you try it on in the store to see if it fits and if it's of good quality, right? Why not do the same with your equipment? You could spend £400 on your new guitar but by the time you bring it home and try it out, you could hate it. You may not be able to return in to the store once you've opened it and used it.


Always try everything in the store, from straps to amps. If you're buying a mic, ask to test that out in store too.
Ask the people in the store if you can refund after. If you can't, this gives you even more reason to ask them for testing time.

Haggle.,
Visit pawn shops or secondhand stores.",How to Save Money on Music Equipment4," Shop owners sometimes like to bump up the price a little more than usual, precisely because they expect to reduce the price on asking. If you don't ask, it could leave you spending loads of money on something worth not so much. To get the price back down to something realistic, you need to haggle. This is a skill that you can practice all day, everyday, provided it's acceptable where you live or shop. It's recommended that you practice a lot because shop owners are on the receiving end of haggling a lot and are skilled at good comebacks. Bear in mind that this skill works best with underground stores that don't get much money, they'll do anything to make you buy something. Some good things to say are:


""Seriously? That's a shame, I only have on me right now.""
""To be honest, I think that's quite a bit. Lower the price and I'll take it off your hands.""
""I saw it cheaper in , I'll get it from there.""
""What? That's way too much! I can find it cheaper elsewhere.""
""The online price is , and with no postage too. I'll buy it that way instead."" (And it might help to start to walk away.)

, A lot of musical instruments end up in such places when people need to sell something quickly to fund general living needs. While it's sad to think that someone else has lost something so good, you can give that instrument a new chance to play sweet music again and save a penny in so doing.

Set goals.,
Change your practice location.,
Change your practice schedule.,
Create a barrier between your practice and the outside world.,
Don’t wait until the last minute to practice.",How to Be Motivated to Practice an Instrument1," Set yourself a goal for each practice session. Write down what you want to accomplish with the practice session beforehand. Keep notes on your progress in a practice log.Dedicate your practice session to achieving your goal rather than adhering to a specific amount of practice time.For example, instead of following a rule of practicing for 30 minutes, focus on achieving your musical goal for the day, whether it takes 12 minutes or 40 minutes.
An example of a goal you might set would be: “This practice session I will memorize four lines of this sheet music.”
When you accomplish goals, reward yourself. Your brain reacts to reward systems with a “habit loop” – meaning when you receive a reward for a task, your brain is inclined to repeat the successful behavior.;
, If your instrument is moveable, change the physical location where you practice. For example, if you usually practice your instrument in the dining room, try practicing in the bedroom instead – perhaps with a window view. Weather permitting, you may even be able to practice outside! Just remember to tune your instrument whenever you change rooms.If your instrument is not easily moveable, such as a piano, you may consider getting a portable version of your instrument (such as a keyboard) so that you can vary your practice location from time to time.
Move any practice accessories with you to the new location, or have duplicates of them. For instance, bring with you a music stand, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, a clean eraser, and any instrument-specific supplies such as guitar picks or reeds. Always have your supplies on-hand, wherever you practice., Individuals are psychologically wired to practice different amounts and in different ways.If you’ve been abiding by a rigid practice schedule, try abandoning it – at least temporarily. Sometimes teachers or parents encourage you to box yourself into a practice timetable that makes you feel restricted rather than inspired. Prove to yourself and others that your creative energy is enough to lead you by ditching your set practicing times and playing when you feel the impulse instead.Schedule days that are “practice-free zones,” when you are not obligated to practice unless you feel the urge to do so.
If you don’t have a practice schedule, you should implement one. Dedicate a certain time of the day to practicing your instrument., When you need to practice, plan a “force field” of sorts as a way of shutting out distractions. It could be a sign, a t-shirt, or a note stuck to your door. Let everyone else know that you’re not to be disturbed while you’re practicing.Have a designated, quiet practice area ready when you need it.Ask others to leave you alone when you practice, at least for a couple of weeks. Try saying, ""I want to find out whether I have more motivation and better results alone or with an audience. Would you mind making sure I'm undisturbed during practice for the next two weeks, to see how it goes?""
If your parents, family or roommates don’t interrupt and are silent when you’re practice, it may be fine for them to be in the room.

, Think of each upcoming lesson and event as a deadline you must prepare for ahead of time.For instance, if you know that you have a concert in 10 days, and you practice 27 hours beforehand (an average of 3 hours per day), you could impress your teacher or friends and maybe even move up chairs in orchestra.Lessons are meant for learning and working on new material. The more you prepare beforehand, the more you will be able to address new concepts during your lessons.

, Do this by counting the beats in the bar. Most songs are written in 4/4(you can count to four in a musical bar), or 3/4 (three beats).

, It is not very important to have the exact chord(E9 instead of E11 for instance), as long as you know the tonic (or main chord tone). This tends to be the lowest note in the chord, and the chord is named after that tone. For example, the tonic of an E Major Chord is E.

,,, If you don't play drums yourself or don't have recording options nearby, use a drum machine (you may find free software on the internet which imitates a drum machine). Either you can use pre-programmed beats, which often works very well, or program it yourself. Most songs favor drum patterns which have the bass drum hitting on beats one and three, snare drum on beats two and four, and hi-hat or ride cymbal on all four beats, often doubling the hits for more rock-influenced music.

, Do this by using either a bass guitar or a keyboard on the darker half of the keys. If you want it simple, the best approach would be to let the bass play the tonic of the chord, if you like to spice things up, you can use notes from whatever chord being played at that beat. The rhythm of the bass is crucial, beyond telling people what chords they are listening to, the bass usually plays together with the drums to establish the groove. A simple way is to let bass play at the same beats as the bass drum. Another is just playing 8th notes(two notes per beat) for å more driving groove.

, Find out how the rhythm section of the song should affect the grove and feel. By using dynamics and spicy notes, one can create songs that have depth of dimension just by adding very basic elements.

Change your timing.,
Use different practice techniques.,
Isolate trouble spots.,
Break practice sessions into blocks.,
Use visible benchmarks to master difficult measures.,
Make practice into a game.",How to Be Motivated to Practice an Instrument2," Play at different speeds: slow, medium and fast. Use a metronome and practice scales with different beat durations or tempos. Instead of playing through the beat continuously, try a stop-and-go method.For instance, play three notes, pause, play three more notes, pause again, and continue this variation.

, Instead of just playing the same piece repeatedly in the same way, try new ways of playing it.Change octaves. Practice with your eyes closed sometimes. Alternate playing softly and loudly. Try practicing while you bounce, dance, wiggle your head, or beatbox.Explore other practice methods, such as chaining. With chaining, you play small units at tempo and slowly build longer chains of units. Start with a small passage and add a measure each time you master a small unit., Play a piece completely through the first time and mark down the places where you ran into difficulty. Take those portions out and practice them separately. Isolating and repeating difficult music passages can help you to master a piece of music.


Instead of getting discouraged when you reach parts that cause you stumble, you extract them and give them hyper-focus until you can play them as well as the rest of the piece., Each day of practicing should at least include a block of playing scales as well as a block of time focused on building technical skills.Repeat one activity (or ""block"") acceptably before moving on to the next. This encourages comfort with the activity and prompts muscle memory to kick in.For example, spend the first block of time warming up, the second block on a difficult piece of music, the third on proper finger placement, and the fourth on some smaller pieces you have already practiced before.Another approach is to time each block. For example, spend 10 minutes on scales. Even if you don’t get it perfect by the end of that time, move on to the next block. Otherwise, getting stuck can be frustrating.

, A good way to do this is to place three objects, such as coins or beads, in front of you (on your music stand, if possible). When you play a challenging measure correctly, move one object to the right. If you play the measure through successfully again, move another object to the right. If you stumble with the notes or rhythm, return all of the objects to the left. You have to play the measure through without errors three times in a row in order to move all of the objects to the right-hand side.Once all of your coins or beads are to the right, you can connect the difficult measure to the measures surrounding it, and then to the rest of the music.

, Make flashcards with musical tasks in four groups: warmups, technical methods, difficult or long songs, and easy or short songs. You can list specific songs, scales or chords on the flashcards, or write in general terms such as genres or octaves. Alternate your practice session with “surprise” flash card days. Choose one flashcard at random from each group to determine which musical pieces you will practice that day.


Roll dice: whatever number you get is how many times you will play a measure or a song.Try incorporating your practice into a board game. Keep a board game designated for instrument practice in your music area. Each time you master a piece of music or a technique, move up a space on the game board and write down what you achieved.

Identify with your instrument.,
Go to concerts and other musical events.,
Select practice pieces that you like.,
Get inspiration from others.,
Get creative.,
Have a recital.,
Take breaks.,
Play with someone else.,
Challenge yourself.",How to Be Motivated to Practice an Instrument3," One of the most important factors in staying motivated to practice music is the enjoyment and satisfaction you gain from playing your instrument. Students who fail to identify with their instrument are less likely to stick to their craft. Remind yourself of the reasons you liked your instrument in the first place.Think about the unique beauty of your instrument and the design that went into making it. Handle it gently and examine its texture, curves and details. Look at your instrument as if it has its own personality, and consider the great potential it has to assist you in elevating your skills., Attending concerts or musicals as an audience member can be inspiring. Participating in these events yourself as a musician can be motivating factors to continue practicing an instrument. Watching musical movies also has the potential to boost your creativity.Use the inspiration from musical events to practice with performance in mind. Think about how skilled musicians played their instruments during performances and channel their examples as you play your own instrument – even when you’re just rehearsing., If you have musical instructors, ask them to allow you to select parts of your practice. Students may learn faster if allowed to choose some of their own music or practice routines. When you practice at home, try playing current music or other pieces that you enjoy.There are various online sources where you can find free sheet music to practice with.

, Ask people whose advice you trust – such as your music teacher or parents – who they consider to be musical greats. Also ask them which pieces by those artists they found to be the most moving. Write down the names of the musicians and specific pieces of music. Then go to an online music source such as YouTube, iTunes or Spotify and listen to some of the songs. Watching performances by musical geniuses can spark your enthusiasm for playing your instrument!If the person you’re asking also plays an instrument or has in the past, ask if he or she knows of any tips for making practice fun.

, Make up songs. Make up words to instrumental melodies that don’t have vocals. Think outside the box: trying to mimic a bird’s song or the refrain of a ballad on your instrument can be a fun way to practice playing by ear.If there is a portion of music you’re struggling with, try improvising the piece by changing chords or notes until you get a better feel for the piece., Invite any peers who also practice instruments to participate. Host a recital for supportive family members and/or friends who love music. They will get a free, personal concert, and you will have an extra incentive to practice! Pick a piece that you love and will enjoy practicing repeatedly.Whether or not you want to schedule a live recital, view every lesson you take as a mini-recital., Distracting yourself can actually boost your creativity. When you are feeling frustrated, take a break and do something that requires more muscle memory than thought, so that your mind can wander. When your brain shifts modes in such a way, you can experience a “creative pause” – new solutions, ideas, and motivation can unexpectedly pop up.For example, try taking a shower, doing the dishes, mowing the lawn or folding laundry. Allow your mind to wander and try not to focus on thinking directly about any obstacles you are facing in music practice.

, Playing music with others can result in social, creative improvisation. You can join in and pick up the rhythm, sound, or tunes of others. Don’t save playing your instrument alongside your peers for lessons or recitals; try practicing and rehearsing with other musicians, whether their instruments are the same as yours or different mediums.There is also software such as Jamulus which allows you to collaborate with other musicians in online jam sessions.


If you don’t have a peer who can practice an instrument alongside you, try asking someone to sing while you play.

, Try playing harder songs. You must take on new challenges in order to develop new skills. However, the challenge should be matched to your skill level.The music you are working to excel at should not make you bored – if it does, it’s below your skill level.
The music should be complex to you, but not so difficult that it makes you anxious. If you find yourself getting discouraged, take it back a notch and practice something not quite so hard.

Men: your tunic should fall right below the knee, lengthwise as was customary in ancient Egypt.The sleeves were normally somewhat loose and usually ranged from at least ¼ to ¾ length for men as well. Currently, tunics for men that extend to the knee can be found at costume shops, medieval collectible shops, Amazon and eBay.
Women: your tunic should extend down to your ankle.Sleeves are optional. Be sure to wear a fitted or tailored tunic. Egyptian women wore very tightly fitted garments which were often hemmed to display their shapely curves and also to prevent the garment from becoming frayed.When searching for a tunic, be sure to search specifically for an Egyptian-style tunic dress as the majority of tunics available now are only shirt-length. The correct tunics for women can also be found at costume shops, as well as on Amazon and eBay.
Keep it simple. Many of today’s tunic’s come in a variety of colors and styles. However, in ancient Egypt, tunics were almost exclusively white.;
, Male Egyptian laborers mainly wore linen loincloths or skirts that were tied at the waist while the rest of the material was draw between the legs to cover the groin area and buttocks.Men who wear loincloths should ideally be shirtless. The only other items typically worn with loincloths are jewelry, adorned collars, headpieces and sandals.

, Egyptians wore headpieces made of fabrics, gems, jewelry and gold for both class status and practical reasons. Egyptian headpieces are often the most extravagant and recognizable part of the ensemble. Without them, it can be difficult to distinguish Egyptian clothing from that of Rome or Greece. Egyptian headpieces are available for purchase at costume shops and online retailers.


Choose an appropriate headdress based on your gender and its historical representation. There were hundreds of crown varieties worn by the ancient Egyptians which represented status, divinity and many other characteristics, so be sure to perform research on any crown you may buy.The Names (striped head cloth) headdress for example, is a blue and gold stripped cloth with an asp in the center which was worn by pharaohs such as King Tutankhamen. The tall, tight-fitting cap crown is most attributed to Queen Nefertiti.

, Ancient Egyptian footwear was created using leather hide and papyrus as straps to secure the hide to the soles of the feet. To replicate the look, sandals should be made from leather with flat soles and the majority of the foot should be exposed.Gladiator-style, t-strap or goddess sandals will complement the look well.

, Many ancient Egyptians who were of the lower classes went barefoot throughout their entire lives. Depending on the environment, you can pull off an even more authentic look by not wearing shoes at all., This should include, earrings, wrist cuffs, bracelets, armbands, anklets and rings.Be sure to wear plenty of gold and/or copper pieces. Gold was in abundance in ancient Egypt.
Don’t forget to add gems or stones. Pendants or rings such as turquoise, emeralds, obsidian, onyx and rock crystal. Pearls were also extremely common as they were native to Egypt.Avoid wearing silver, as it was not available in ancient Egypt., Ancient Egyptians often wore these items for either protection or power. Amulets contained carved images of animals, gods, solar deities, other humans and a variety of other figures., One of the most recognizable aspects of ancient Egyptian wear is the adornment of sewn together beads, stones and metals which draped over the shoulders, collarbone and upper back.Keep in mind when searching for or making collars that those made of precious metals and stones were often made for the upper classes and royalty, whereas collars made from shells, wood and bone were often made by the lower or working classes. Be sure to find the appropriate-style collar for your ensemble.
Authentic Egyptian collars can be found at many artifact and antique stores or can be handmade with customized amulets and charms.

, Use bronzer or apply a gold, shimmery foundation to the skin. Try using shades of copper and brown blushes to highlight the cheekbones.Use a foundation brush to start applying foundation to the center of the face and blend outward.Apply brown, deep red, nude or gold tinted lipstick.

, Using jet black liquid eyeliner or eyeliner pencil start in the corner of the upper eyelids (near the bridge of the nose) and apply eyeliner right along the edge of each eyelid.


At the outer corner of the eyelid, wing the eyeliner horizontally, bringing it out to about ½ inch past the eyelid. Wing the eyeliner slightly upward toward the very end of the pencil stroke.Apply eyeliner to the bottom eyelid. Starting at the bottom corner, directly above the eyelashes and draw to the outer corner of the eye.

, Use shimmery blue, emerald green or gold eyeshadow to dab the upper and lower eyelids.


Use a small makeup brush and apply a liberal amount of eye shadow on the entire upper eyelid, brushing from the inner corner of the eyelid to the outer corner. Extend the eyeshadow to cover the top of the wingtip you’ve created.Add a smaller amount of eyeshadow directly underneath the bottom eyelashes and extend to cover the bottom of the wingtip you’ve created.
Add a lighter shade of eyeshadow right underneath the brow line for a more dramatic effect.

, Liberally apply mascara to the upper and lower eyelashes to lengthen them and darken the eyes. Use the brush to pull and extend the eyelashes

, Start from the inner corner of the eyebrow and fill in the eyebrows with black or dark brown eyebrow pencil all the way to the outer corner. Try to ensure that the eyebrows appear smooth and even all the way across.

, Expect to make some pattern alterations, as modern patterns have evolved considerably from ""old timey"" clothing patterns.

, This may entail finding a craftsperson who still weaves with a loom if you are determined to be authentic. Many costume designers draw the line here... they will use modern weave and sewing machines to create a costume from an old pattern...

Secure the sheet on your left shoulder.,
Wear the right undergarments.,
Wear the right footwear.",How to Put on an Authentic Roman Toga," Roman togas were traditionally made out of wool. If you want to be completely authentic, start with a single piece of woolen cloth in the shape of a semicircle.


Rich Romans chose the best forms of Italian wool, especially the wool from Apulia or Tarentum. The wool can be hot, but it helped the fabric stick together. Strive for between 5 and 6 yards. A child’s toga should take only 4 yards (3.7 m). You will need a lot of cloth. The authentic toga is 18 feet (5.5 m) long and 12 feet high.The toga originated from an Etruscan garment called the “tebenna.” The word toga comes from Latin “tegere,” which means “to cover.”Only free men wore togas in ancient Rome; The basic female garment was a long tunic that reached to the ground and was called a stola. Children were more likely seen in belted tunics.
Togas are meant to be worn loose as an outer garment without sleeves, open from the waist up. Typically, togas are draped around the body, with one edge on the left side of the body, and then wound around the back and beneath the right am. The loose end of cloth is thrown over the left shoulder.;
, In ancient Rome, regular togas were spotless white. The toga’s white color was required by law.Go to a fabric store. You can purchase fabric pretty cheaply.Some politicians used chalk to whiten their togas so they would stand out more. Candida means white, and candidates were called “the white ones.”
If you don’t choose white, try purple because that color denoted higher status in ancient Rome (usually indicated through a purple stripe on the toga). Sometimes black togas were worn during periods of mourning.
Winning military commanders did occasionally wear brightly colored and embroidered togas. Ceremonial togas were fully purple or included the purple stripes. Kings, augurs, and some priests wore them. In ancient Rome, purple dye came from the glands of sea snails found in the Mediterranean. The purple stripe ran across the straight edge of the toga.

, If you don’t have wool, you could try using a regular white bedsheet. Many people have gone this route for costume parties.


A twin sized sheet can be too small and short. A King sheet might get too bulky. A full or Queen sheet is the best choice, in most cases, unless the toga is for a child or someone the size of one.
Togas should look dignified. Romans considered it improper to be seen in public without a toga. Eventually the toga became formal wear seen in legal courts, the theater, or at the imperial court.
Slaves, non-citizens, and women were not allowed to wear togas in ancient Rome., Make sure that you are folding it lengthwise. Fold the cloth just short of the halfway mark if you want the toga to drape longer across your body.


Take one end of the toga, and drape it across your left shoulder. You will want to adjust the cloth so that its bottom lands above your left ankle.
Hold the toga in place with the left arm and body. Wrap the cloth around your back. Stop when it reaches across the back to the right side of your body.
When wrapping the cloth around your back, wrap about three feet of the fabric about 1.5 times around your waist.

, Take the rest of the cloth’s width in hand, and create folds or ripples in it. Some describe this as an accordion-like texture.


Wrap the cloth the rest of the way around your body, under your right arm and then across the body’s front.
Drape the remaining part over your left shoulder. This is the most important look of the toga: It must be draped over one shoulder, usually the left.
Alternatively, bring both of the fabric ends up to one shoulder, and tie them. Then take the extra materials from the knot area, and fold it down under the rest of the fabric.

, Folding a bedsheet into a toga is very similar, with the exception that the sheet is likely to be rectangular in shape instead of a semi-circle.


Take a corner of the sheet in hand. Hold it in front of the top of your left shoulder. Drape it across the chest. Tuck it under your right arm.
Wrap it around the back. Tuck it under the left arm and in front of your chest. Take the second corner. Bring it across your chest under your arm and around your back.
Bring the corner up over your back. The toga should be about knee length. All you will need is bed sheet, some safety pins, and a decorative pin.

, You may want to use a safety pin to do this, but you could also use a decorate pin or brooch.


Pin the brooch on the shoulder or chest. Or fasten the two ends of the cloth or sheet with a brooch, safety pin or knot. The brooch can be in any color, and could even contain bright jewels. Romans were not supposed to pin or sew their togas. If you use a more slippery fabric, though, you will have to do so or it will fall down.
The woolen fabric of a traditional Roman toga did not have much stitching or sewing. There also weren’t button holes. Finish off the look with a cord or rope belt. Usually, this belt should match the color of the toga, most commonly white.

, Only free Roman citizens could wear the toga. In the old days, togas were worn over naked bodies, but later they were worn over tunics and tied at the waist with a belt.


Roman undergarments consisted of a simple loin cloth that was knotted on both sides. The undergarments had different names.
Women also wore a band that was tightly tied across their bust. Undergarments were generally made of linen.
As undergarments, it’s best to wear a plain white T-shirt and white or flesh colored underwear. The Romans wore short-sleeved wool tunics under their togas., You’re not going to look very authentic if you pair your Roman toga with a pair of high heels or sneakers!


Roman men wore leather boots or sandals. The boots were designed to outlast the rigors of marching, and the sandals were commonly worn for comfort in the summer. You can find Roman sandals or boots for purchase on many sites online.
Roman sandals typically had lacing up the calf. Leather cords or braids attached the sole of the sandal to the leg. There were many different kinds of sandals.Roman shoes were generally made out of leather and sometimes out of pigskin. Romans who were very wealthy or high in status would dye their sandals red. You could carry a shield. Some people have used hub caps!

, Measure the head size, height, waist size, arm and leg length, and any other needed measurements for the person that will be wearing the armor. These measurements will help determine the necessary dimensions that you will need to make the helmet, breastplate, shoulder armor, or any other miscellaneous coverings. Though these won’t be your primary means of sizing the armor, they will be useful to reference whenever you’re making a cut, connection, or alteration that you can’t accurately test.

, The fastest way to do this is to have a friend hold pieces of flexible, sturdy paper (such as poster board) against you and draw each piece of the design individually, creating a rough outline that you could then modify as necessary. A more accurate method would be to make a form (or a mannequin) to build the paper template around.

, Make sure all the pieces have been accounted for and adjust their sizes or proportions as necessary. Whenever you have matching pieces (e.g.: two shin plates, gauntlets, etc.), choose the nicer version and scrap the other one; that way, you can use the nice one as the pattern for the other to keep your armor symmetrical. When you’re happy with your pieces, clean up and smooth out the lines, label both your original sketch and the corresponding pieces (making note of any that will be duplicated), and cut all the shapes.

, Trace each piece to the craft foam with a ball-point pen (which will glide smoothly over the material without snagging or tearing). Making duplicates of pieces where necessary. Label the undersides and then cut the shapes out.


To make very large pieces, you may need to patch two pieces of foam together. Preferably, attach the pieces where it is inconspicuous, or can be integrated into the design. For example, creating a seam down the center of a breastplate.
You can use a number of other materials to create your costume armor, such as cardboard, Wonderflex or anything else that suits your means. The same steps can be applied to any material.
To make your foam go further, trace large pieces first and then fit the smaller ones in around them.

, Lightly sketch the designs with a ball-point pen or a dull knifeand when you’re happy, go over them several times while pressing hard to engrave them into the foam. It’s much easier to draw on the foam while it’s flat and not yet assembled. Just be sure not to tear the materials.

, Since it’s flexible, this will simply be a matter of gluing it into curves in many places. In some places, however, you will want to mold the foam into shapes that hold on their own. This is done by holding the foam near a steady, safe heat source (such as a heat gun or stove) to soften it and then manually bending it over another object such as a liter bottle or rolling pin.


You will only have a few seconds to do this, so work quickly. It’s best to test your technique on a few scrap pieces beforehand so that you learn how to heat the foam without causing it to scorch, shrink, or bubble.
If you want you can also try using a hair dryer on high heat or an iron to heat the foam.
If you don't have a heat source you can try wrapping the armor around a rounded object for a couple days to create the desired curves. You can create arm or leg pieces around a Pringles can and use a rubber band to hold them in place., White school glue is fine for this.In some cases (ex. in places with lots of overlap or dramatic curves), it will make sense to do this after the pieces have already been heat-molded to keep from putting undue strain on the material. However, when you’re dealing with pieces that require minimal molding or don’t overlap in a way that constricts their movement too much, you might want to glue them together before molding them.

, Flip joined pieces over, paint them with glue, and smooth a gauzy fabric (ex. cotton crinkle gaze or cheesecloth) over them, making sure to work into creases and curves with a pointed edge. After it dries, cut away the excess and apply one more coat of glue.

, If you are dealing with lots of pieces, you might have to assemble a number of them just to make one section of one part of the armor. Think about where it makes the most sense to join subsections together before connecting them to make larger pieces.

, Since the foam is flexible, you will have quite a bit of leeway with this: a well-placed seam that you can force your way into and out of would be no problem for craft foam. For traditional-style armor, however, you will want to mimic the way that real armor is assembled by connecting various pieces with leather or fabric straps that you can untie/unbuckle as necessary.

, Unless you’ve made a full, one-piece suit, you will likely have to attach separate sections differently. Wearing a tight-fitting outfit underneath the armor and attaching Velcro to a number of places as anchor points would work well provided that you line everything up correctly.


You might, for example, stick double-sided Velcro to the necessary parts of your under-outfit. Press the armor onto these points in front of a mirror until the look right. Then more firmly attach each Velcro half to its respective part of the ensemble using thread or a strong glue to hold the pieces in place.

, If you embossed a design into your armor, simply draw over it with fabric paint from a squirt-tube to create a raised design. You might have to do this more than once to make it more visible. Since the results will be thick, allow this to dry overnight.

, Since the foam is spongy, you will need to seal it before applying any glue. One suggested mixture is 1 part school glue or Sobo glue, 1 part flexible fabric glue, and 2 parts water. Apply and dry thin coats until sealant no longer forms holes where air bubbles from the foam pop through. This may take as many as 7 or 8 coats, but because the layers are thin, the dry time shouldn’t be unbearable. Don’t allow debris to stick to the glue or it will produce bumps in the armor.

, If the armor sticks out in places (leaving the underside exposed), painting the back will give it a more professional look., Because the foam will bend and move with your body, ordinary paints will crack. On a piece of scrap foam, experiment with flexible craft paints (ex. fabric paint) to see what will work for your design. Be sure to apply the paint evenly to prevent streaking and work it into and cracks or crevices.

, This can be done by brushing dark acrylic paint (ex. a mixture of black and green for a tarnished copper look) over your armor and wiping most of it away before it dries so that hints of it remain in the cracks.

Cut the 1” satin ribbon based on the wearer’s neck length, plus two inches.
It’s important to buy ribbon based on how high you want the ruff to be. This example will create a 2-3 inch ruff.
You can also use an online calculator to determine just how much ribbon you are going to need for the ruff.;
, Crease the ribbon so you have a neat edge.

, Do this on a gridded mat to ensure the pleats are spaced evenly. Or, use a ruler to mark out 1 inch sections on the ribbon with a pencil.


As you work, try not to crease the wire too much. You want to bend it, but not break it.
Make the pleats 1.5 inches if you are working with 1.5 inch ribbon instead of 1 inch ribbon.
Do not cut the wired ribbon off the spool. Always work from the length on the spool. This way, you won’t accidentally make the wired ribbon too short.

, The wired edge of the ribbon will hold the pleats in place.


Go back with a pencil if they get a little out of shape while you are working on them.
Be sure the fold the cut end of the wired ribbon under so the wire doesn’t poke out. You want a nice folded under edge. It should appear neat and clean.

, Thread the needle and start at one end of the wired ribbon. Hold the pleats in place if the wire is springy. Be patient and work carefully so you don’t crush any of the pleats as you sew the ribbon.


Sew down one side of the ribbon and then go back and sew down the other side.
Make sure your stitches go around the wire on the edge of the ribbon.
You can also try working in stages. Pleat the wired ribbon and then sew on a few inches of ribbon. Then, pleat more of the wired ribbon, and sew on a few inches more of ribbon.

, Just sew the wire and ribbon pleat as best you can. The wired edge will be hidden in the ruff and won’t be visible.


But if the wire pops out on the outer edge of the ruff, it is going to look unpolished and sloppy. This is why it is important to get the sewn-in kind of wired ribbon.

, At the end of the measured ribbon, fold the wired ribbon under so you have a nice, neat end.

, This will help the wearer tie on the ruff and secure it.


Elizabethans wore their ruffs tied in the back. Women sometimes wore their ruffs open in the front, particularly if they were wearing an open partlet with a low cut bodice., The wearer will likely sweat when wearing the ruff band. So keep it looking clean and nice by washing it after use.


Hand wash it in the sink with a little warm water and mild soap. Let it air dry on a towel.
Store the ruff in a sturdy flat box, also known as “band boxes”. This will keep the ruff clean and shaped.
If the ruff gets crushed, it can easily be reformed into an accordion shape with a dowel or pencil.

Wear undergarments.,
Choose your material.",How to Tie a Toga1," You can wear a traditional tunic, if you have one. But wear something under your toga. For men, a white T-shirt works well. For women, a tube top or strapless bra is a good choice. Both genders should wear shorts. You will want these undergarments to pin and secure your wrapped toga to when done, and prevent any unwanted exposure if the toga slips.

, A cotton twin flat bed sheet works well. Most use a white sheet but there s no need to stay traditional. Considering standing out by using prints or an unexpected solid color like purple.

Determine how much linen you will need to buy.
Look for evenweave handkerchief-weight linen. Go to your local fabric store and ask for samples of linen. For the best looking ruff, try to buy the most tightly-woven fabric available. Fabrics of this quality range from $12-$80 per yard, so buy linen based on your budget.
Be wary of Chinese linen, woven from a very short staple fiber and prone to wrinkling.
Irish, German, and Italian linens are all good options.

, Wash it in hot water. Let it dry and then press it with an iron., You’re looking for the true grain of the linen. You don’t want to cut strips from the length-wise grain, as these strips won’t spring up from the neckband of the ruff properly.


Draw the thread and then cut along this line. Continue to pull the thread with the needle to get it started.

, A 3” wide strip produces an average 1570s ruff with a finished depth of around 2 ½”.

, Hold them so the edges meet. Thread the needle. The, use a whip stitchto attach them. Try to catch the smallest amount of thread possible at the edge of each piece of linen.


If you do the stitch properly, the stitch should be barely visible from the exposed side of the linen pieces.
There should be a slight ridge on the back side of the linen pieces.
Continue to attach pieces of linen together with whip stitches.

, This will stop them from unraveling. Try to use the least amount of thread possible as you do not want to add bulk to the ruff.


Avoid using a zigzag stitch to finish the edges. The ruff will look less authentic.

, Use a gathering stitchto form the pleats of the ruff.


Run the first line of gathering stitches about ⅛” from the unhemmed edge.
Run another line of gathering threads about ¼” away from the first line of stitches.
Create two to four lines of gathering stitches total. Keep the fabric flat as you make the stitches.
Leave a 10” to 12” tail on either end of the linen.

, Always make the neckband a bit bigger than necessary as the ruff can be bulky. You don’t want the neckband to be too tight, but it should fit snuggly.


It may help to gather up the ruff and loop it around your neck. Then, use a measuring tape to measure the length. Don’t be surprised if the measurement is larger than you thought, as the bulk of the ruff can add up to 2” to your neck measurement.
For a 15” x 2” neckband, start with a rectangle that is 16” x 8”. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, and press it with an iron.
Unfold the fabric and then fold the two long edges toward the center crease line. Press this fold with an iron. The fabric strip should now be 4” wide.
Unfold the strip and then fold it under ½” on the short ends, towards the inside. Press the folds.
Refold the two long edges down toward the center fold line and then bring the two long folded over edges together. The neckband should now be 15” x 2”.
Press the neckband well. You can use some starch to hold the creases, if desired.

, Use your needle and thread. Divide the ruff into workable units.


For a 15” neckband, for example, mark three 5” sections on the neckband.
Gather the ruff to 15” and adjust the pleats so they are even.
You can hit the finished, gathered ruff with a shot of steam from an iron to keep the pleats in place. This will make the ruff easier to attach to the neckband.
Whipstitch the neckband to the pleated ruff. Work from the center of the neckband to the short ends.
Make sure the end of the ruff stops just shy of folded under the short end of the neckband.
Once you have completed all the stitching, tie a square knot to the gathering threads. Clip them to about 1” and tuck the tails back into the neckband. Finish the short ends by whip stitching them as close to the edge as you can.

, Sew 12 to 18 inches of narrow ribbon or cord to each end of the ruff. This will help the wearer tie on the ruff and secure it.

, Be warned that the ruff will likely collapse when it gets wet. So wash linen ruffs in hot water. Then, dry the ruff by rolling it in a dry towel. Linen absorbs a lot of water, so you may need to use a large towel.


Don’t wring out wet linen. Instead, hang dry the ruff.

, There are two methods of starching:Cold starch: dissolve raw starch in water and apply it to the fabric. The starch is then “cooked” (turns into a gel) when the linen ruff is ironed. This produces a nice stiff finish, but requires skill so you don’t scorch the fabric or end up with cloth stuck to the iron.
Using boiled starch: Mix two tablespoons of starch (corn, wheat, or rice) in 1 cup of water. Either microwave the starch on high or heat it on the stove. Stir it until it becomes thick and transparent.
Regardless of the method, starch should always be applied to damp, not dry, linen, so it can penetrate the fibers.
Work the starch into all of the folds. Then, gently shake out the excess starch. But make sure there is a rather thick coating on the ruff.
Let the ruff dry. Open up the pleats as the ruff is drying so they don’t stick together.

Roman togas were typically white, but politicians and important people wore off-white togas with purple accents. You need a large amount of fabric to use for making an authentic Roman toga.Buy a piece of fabric that is four to six yards long. Four yards is a good length to make a child’s toga and six yards is recommended to make an adult male’s toga.;
, You need to cut the fabric into a semicircle shape to be able to wrap your toga correctly. Lay the fabric out on a table or the floor. Use a pencil to make a small mark near the edge at the center of the fabric., Cut an arc from one corner of the fabric to the center mark. Fold the fabric in half, and then lay it back out on the table or floor with the cut side up. Cut the bottom side to match the arc of the top side. Unfold the fabric and the fabric should have one straight edge and one semi circle edge.


Your toga should be approximately 18 feet long with a semicircle radius around 7 to 8 feet.

, Fold the edges of the fabric over 1 inch to create a hem. Use straight pins to attach the folded fabric over. Use a straight stitch on a sewing machine or a hand stitch to create a hem around the entire edge of the fabric. The hem will prevent the fabric from unraveling.


You can add a decorative edge of colored fabric as you create the hem by sewing a thin colored strip to the edge of the fabric along the curved edge of the semicircle.

, Drape one end of the semicircle over your shoulder in front of you. The long end should be in behind you.The end of the fabric hanging over your shoulder in front of you should come to just above your ankles.
The remaining length of the fabric will be behind your body.

, The toga will wrap around the front of your body to cover your back and right side., The toga will now wrap around your entire body. The fabric will be open on the left side, but the bulk of the fabric will come together to cover you completely.


Pull any remaining fabric that is hanging on the ground around the left side of your body to the front.
The fabric should wrap around your body snugly so it doesn't slip off when you move. Ideally the fabric will still be loose enough to appear full and flowing.

, Secure your toga in place with the rope as a belt. The toga should cover your entire body except for your right shoulder.You can attach a safety pin where the fabric overlaps on your left shoulder to help hold the toga in place. Conceal the pin under the fabric to maintain the authenticity of the look.

, A large costume jewelry broach can add flair to the toga. Consider golden or jeweled broaches to pin on the left shoulder to help hold the toga in place.

, Braided ropes such as decorative curtain pulls can make a great belt for a roman toga. Double the rope to wrap it around your body twice to get a fuller look., Strappy leather sandals such a gladiator sandals are a good addition to a Roman style toga. Sandals fashioned from rope also provide an authentic look.

, Fashion a headband from thin tree branches by twisting the branches around each other to form a circle. You can also use a decorative fabric like a golden lamé to create a headband by adding some elastic to a thin strip of fabric.

, If you are wearing the toga on a cold night, consider adding a purple or golden velvet shawl or stole to cover your shoulders.

, The only jewelry worn by Roman men was rings. Women also wore necklaces bracelets and earrings, however men kept their jewelry more simplistic."

Talk to your friends.",How to Write an Artist's Statement1," Before you can write your statement, you should ask yourself some important questions. Your statement is your chance to discuss your art process, your ideas, and how your art fits in the field. Be honest with yourself as you answer these questions:What are my influences (e.g. personal, historical, theoretical, cultural)?
What themes, ideas, and subjects are in my art?
What do I do?
How do I do it?
Why do I it?
What do I want other people to understand about my art?
Is there anything about my art that I do not want to discuss? Why?;
, Set a timer for 15 minutes and write down your responses to these questions. If your responses lead you down another path, write about those things as well. This exercise helps you move your ideas from your head to a piece of paper. You can incorporate drawings into this writing process as well.It may be helpful to target your writing to one specific question instead of trying to answer multiple questions. For example, you may choose to write about why you use oil to paint.
You can also write on multiple pieces of art paper instead of a notebook so that you can rearrange your ideas and make them more visual.

, A mind map is a visual diagram that lets you connect information to once central idea. Think of it as an idea tree.Write the answer to one of your questions in the middle of the page. The you can use arrows or dotted lines for all of the answers to your questions.All of the arrows and/or dotted lines do not have to connect to the center of the diagram. Some of them may connect to each other.
You can also use pictures or drawings to communicate your thoughts and answers.

, Reading examples of good and poorly written artist's statements can help you craft your statement. Pay special attention to artists whose work is similar to yours and artists that you admire.You may want to read examples after you have finished brainstorming. This will help you format your ideas without being influenced by others.


Check out books, exhibition catalogs, and periodicals to find examples. If you are in school, ask your teacher for examples or talk to a librarian.
Take note of the phrasing that people use to describe their work.

, It can be hard to write about your art. Display your art and invite some of your friends over. Video and/or audio record the conversation so you can listen to it later. You should also take notes during the discussion.Pay special attention to any questions and critiques about your work. These things are often what people really want to know about your work.
Consider discussing your work with both artists and non-artists. This will allow you to see your art from multiple perspectives.

Print the template at home, your local library, or send it to a print shop.If you are searching for a template for a princess crown, look for templates with softer shapes and curves. The more delicate, the better.
If you are looking for a template for a royal crown, look for templates with jagged shapes.;
, Find a pair of scissors. Follow the lines and carefully cut out the template. If the template has two parts, line up the edges and staple or glue them together.








If you are doing this project with kids, assist and supervise with this step.

, Cardstock, cardboard, or even poster paper are great options! Set the paper “wrong side” up, the side that won’t be showing when you wear it. Lay the template on the piece of paper you will be using. Use a pencil to lightly trace the template onto the paper. Once complete, remove the template and cut out the crown.








If you want to use thinner paper, such as scrapbook paper or wrapping paper, glue it down onto a stiffer paper (such as cardstock) first.
If you want your crown to be a special color (such as silver or gold), paint it first using spray paint or acrylic paint. Let the paint dry, then trace it, then cut it out.

, Measure the length of the crown. Cut out a strip of cardboard or fabric that is the length of the crown and 1 to 1.5 inches wide. Line up the bottom edge of the strip with the bottom edge of the crown. Adhere this strip to the “wrong side” of the crown with glue. The cardboard or fabric will reinforce the crown and prevent it from ripping. Allow the glue to dry.







, You can decorate your crown any way you choose! Use markers, crayons, or colored pencils to make cool designs. Bedazzle your crown with your gems and sequins! Sprinkle glitter on the crown. Let your creativity flow! Allow your decorations to dry.








To create a princess crown, use silver or gold glitter glue, and pink or purple gem stones.
To create a royal crown, use gold glitter glue, and blue, red, green, or purple gem stones.
To make a crown fit for an ice queen, use lots of silver or iridescent glitter glue. Use lots of blue and silver gem stones.
If you want to make a creepy crown, consider using black glitter glue, and glueing on some plastic spiders and black or purple gem stones.

, Circle the cut out crown around the wearer’s head. The edges of the crown should overlap. Make a pencil mark where the two edges overlap. Remove the crown from the wearer’s head. Line up the edges at the pencil mark and staple or glue them together. Let the glue dry before wearing your crown!"

Select and prep the flowers.,
Cut, fit, and loop a piece of twine covered wire.,
Arrange and tape mini floral arrangements.,
Wrap the first mini arrangement around the twine.,
Wrap the remaining floral arrangements.,
String a piece of twine or ribbon through the loops.",How to Make a Crown3," For this project, you will need a pair of garden shears or sharp scissors, floral tape, and floral wire. You will also need a roll of pliable twine covered wire and a roll of plain twine or ribbon., Choose 2 or 3 types of flowers for your crown. Roses, daisies, violets, tulips, and lavender are great options! Select 1 to 2 filler flowers. Try baby’s breath or fresh pine. Cut 8 to 12 sprigs of each flower and filler flower. Make sure each stem is approximately 3 inches long., Wrap the twine covered wire once around your head. Place a finger where the pliable twine meets and remove it from your head. Grab the shears or scissors and cut the twine several inches longer than you need it. Form a small loop at each end of the wire. Twist each loop closed. You will slip a piece of ribbon through the loops to tie the crown shut.








Consider wrapping floral tape around the twisted part to hide it and keep it from catching onto your hair.

, Combine 4 or 6 stems of flowers and filler flowers together to form a small bouquet. Make sure the mini arrangement looks good from multiple angles. Start wrapping your arrangement at the base of the flowers. Tightly wrap the tape downwards to the ends of the stems. Create 6 to 7 more unique mini bouquets.The mini arrangements don’t all have to look alike. Put together unique combinations!

, Grab the piece of pliable twine with the loops on the ends. Place 1 mini arrangement parallel to the twine—the end of the stem should be located at the base of the left loop. Wrap a piece of floral wire around the stems of the small bouquet and the pliable twine.








In order to make the floral tape sticky, you have to stretch it a bit.

, Working from left to right, slide the stems of the next mini arrangement under the flowers of the secured mini bouquet. Wrap a piece of floral wire around the stems of the small bouquet and the pliable twine. Continue adding mini arrangements to the pliable twine until you have reached the right loop.







, Cut a 2 foot piece of twine or ribbon. Thread the ribbon or twine through the two loops and tie a loose bow. Place the crown on your head and adjust the crown’s size. After adjusting the crown to the proper size, tie the ribbon or twine in a double knot. Enjoy your fresh floral crown!

You may choose any kind of silk flowers that you would like. Roses, baby’s breath, peonies, poppies, daisies, dahlias, and lamb’s ear are all great options!


Consider going with a seasonal theme. For example, for a Fall-themed crown, use lots of reds, oranges, and yellows. Try to include some maple leaves, sunflowers, and marigolds.
Consider going with a holiday theme. For example, if you want to create a Halloween themed crown, consider using dark purple and black flowers. Roses, mums, and dahlias.

, Unwind the spool of floral wire. Gently wrap the floral wire around your head. The end of the wire should overlap the wire by 3 to 4 inches. Remove the wire crown from your head and cut the wire. Wrap the ends of the wire around the circular frame.


Consider wrapping a piece of floral tape around the seam to hide it, and to prevent it from catching your hair.

, Grab a pair of wire and your silk flowers. Cut the heads of each flower off, leaving 3 to 4 inches of stem. Leave the greens or smaller flowers, like the baby’s breath, in bunches.









Consider saving the leaves off of some of the larger flowers. These can make great fillers.
Do not use scissors to cut the silk flower stems. Many silk flowers have wires inside the stems, which can ruin a good pair of scissors.

, Place and wrap each flower around the wire crown with floral tape one at a time. Work counter clockwise around the circle. Place the head of one flower on top of the taped stem of the attached flower. Try to make all of the flowers face in the same direction. Here are some ideas on arranging your flowers:









Place the largest flowers in the front, and use smaller flowers towards the end.
Alternate large and small flowers.
Consider looping long pieces of ribbon at the back of the crown.

, Place the crown atop your head. Enjoy the silk floral head piece for years to come!

Collect your materials.,
Once this step is complete put the shirt on and pull across one side of the shirt as if your doing up a bathrobe.,
Grab your red ribbon and with many pins, pin down the ribbon mimicking the pattern that is on asuna's costume.,
If you have a dress, cut out the front of the dress where desired to create asuna's half skirt leaving the front hanging so you can create the arrow front.,
For your shield, use white fabric (all you need to do is draw the flattened shape of the shield on an A3 sized piece of paper).,
Draw the top of the shields armour plate on to a separate piece of paper and pin to white material.,
For asuna's socks, take one pair of your knee high socks and with your red ribbon sew it in a circle around the top of the sock.,
To create the arm bands, take your second pair of socks and cut off the toe part of the sock only.,
For the shoes - if possible you can purchase kids school ankle boots (flat ones) and spray paint them white and with the fabric paint paint on the design of asuna's shoes by eye.,
Purchase a wig for Asuna's hair unless you already have hair similar to hers.,
For the bit that hands of asuna's arms- to create this we laid out a flat piece of paper proceeded to draw the flattened version of it on the ground.",How to Make a Cosplay Costume for Asuna Yuuki from Sword Art Online,"


Take your white dress and cut off the collar. Later re-attach this using a sewing machine to achieve Asuna's high collared top. If you couldn't find a white dress that is sleeveless and button up - two white business shirts will also work for this. With the business shirt pup up the collar and cut it off - reattaching it to achieve the high collar yet again and cut off the skirts sleeves leaving you with what looks a bit like a vest.;
, Once it is fitted across your body the way you want it to be , mark where it lines up with a lead pencil. Where you mark this put Velcro on the underside of the shirt here and the shirt so you can hold the shirt in place.

, Once pinned down and you are happy with your arrangement, sew the ribbon onto the costume using a sewing machine, ( be careful not to sew the costume together in any unnecessary places.)

, Just fold the material cut the access and sew the front of the material to create the small arrow. Hem the dress if it is too long.


If you are using a business shirt proceed to grab your white material and sew this on to the bottom of the shirt to create the half skirt that is attached via a sewing machine to the top of the costume.

, To achieve this, hold the piece of paper up to your chest and shape it against this, trying to crease the paper against your curves- or take a pencil and draw a light curved outline around your chest area to create the armor plate.


Once you are happy with the shape cut this out of the piece of paper, pin it to your material and cut it out. You may need to use stiffer white fabric for this to achieve stronger armor.

, Also cut this out and layer with several other pieces of material and sew together. Once this is complete take your silver fabric paint and paint around the outside of your armor plate and in pencil draw on the crosses and then paint those also.

, Repeat this beneath this first circle leaving a gap. This is simplest way of recreating asuna's socks.


If you wish to recreate her socks perfectly pull the socks on and look carefully at pictures of the character in her costume. Use pins as a guideline and pin the ribbon in the patterns you see on to your socks.
The way to do this is on the side of the socks the tops are almost a semi circle the sides of which come down at the front and back of your leg giving that angled look. For the top of the socks do half a semi circle shape above the semi circle on the stocking that has been pinned on with the ribbon.
Sew the ribbon on and then proceed to cut the excess sock into the desired shape leaving room to fold over the top and sew in order to hem the sock and prevent any fraying.
To hold the socks up you could use elastic beneath the tops of the socks and securing it around the tops of your legs or there is available at some craft shops spray on adhesive. You can spray this (skin friendly glue) to your stockings and they should hold. otherwise- double sided tape of the likes that is used on bra's isn't a bad idea also.

, The part where your heel sits can be pulled up and directly placed over your elbow.


Hem the socks by turning them inside out folding the tops over where you've cut them and sew them to prevent fraying. Cut the opposite end of the sock into a circular V almost so the top of the V reaches the knuckle of your index finger and opens at your wrist underneath.
To the part beneath the V sew some of the lace- and to the top of V using fabric paint, just paint the outer parts of the V on the top so they look like asuna's arm sleeves. to the tops of the sleeves using your sewing machine sew the lace completely around the tops of the arms.
If the lace is too long you can turn the sleeves inside out, fold the lace in a zigzag pattern (not the top!) kind of underneath itself and sew this to make the lace shorter- when the turn the sleeves back the right way out the lace should be shorter and hold itself up easily.

, It's quite simple. Otherwise you could for comfort purchase a pair of canvas flat shoes and paint these instead.

, Purchase an orangish blonde colour- or whatever you see fit. The color of asuna's hair is debatable.

, It looks for reference when flat - a bit like the union jack. this isn't too difficult to work out. Place your pattern onto the piece of red material and cut it out twice. Sew the pieces of material together, once shaped spray with fabric stiffener only after sewing gold ribbon around the outer edges. - using Velcro you will attach this to the upper part of your back and to the fronts of your chest one on either side. for the arm loops connect them using Velcro also.

It's best to be wearing the shirt already when adding the mask. That way, you can check that the pantyhose length is adequate.

,, It needs to be secure, as the fabric will unravel once cut and the knot prevents this from occurring to the mask part.

, They can be used for some other pantyhose craft, so add them to your craft box.


The knot should be as unobtrusive as possible - perhaps tape it down with clear tape to help achieve this.

, Done!

, Wrap two to four white feather boas around the body of one leotard. Start in the center back of the neck and secure the boa to the fabric with safety pins.


Make sure that the boas are wrapped with a few spare inches in each parallel, so that the costume can be filled with batting.
Meanwhile, spiral the boas as closely as you can to each other so that you can get full coverage in your costume.
For a more durable costume, sew the feather boas to the leotard.

, Choose sweater tights or lined tights so that your skin doesn’t show through.

, Wrap several layers of white wool batting around your torso to make a plump chicken. Then, pull the feathered leotard over the wool batting., You can also find and wear a novelty chicken hat in place of this homemade model.

,, Trace around the template with a fabric pen. Cut through both layers of red felt around the template.

, Sew the perimeter of the top edge of the comb together. Turn the shape right side out.

, Sew the remaining edge shut, while sewing it onto the white pilot cap. You should attach the chicken comb from the center front to the center back of the cap, like a mohawk.


Once attached, the wool batting will keep the comb stiff. Tuck more into the comb before you finish sewing if it falls to the side.

, For a child’s costume, you can find a small pair. For an adult costume, you will need to find extra large rubber gloves.

Glue the back piece to the mask.,
Poke tiny holes into the eye area.,
Make the neck cover (dickey or false shirt front).,
Cut off one leg from a pair of white pantyhose.,
Put it all together.,
Done.",How to Make a Slender Man Mask2," Use the kind that can be found in costume stores and dollar shops what covers your face but has eye holes, mouth hole and nostril holes. This mask will keep the fabric away from your face, helping you to keep breathing and seeing okay.


Try the mask on for comfort. If it isn't comfortable, make any adjustments needed before gluing the fabric to it, as it's harder to do afterward.

, Lycra, spandex, etc. are good choices but if you're not sure, check with the fabric retailer who might be able to offer some options once they understand what you're trying to do.

, Attach the fabric to the mask by gluing it all the way around, overlapping the fabric edges to the back of the mask, going from the top of the mask down. A hot glue gun will make this easier but take care not to melt the plastic if it's a plastic mask.


As you glue, keep the fabric taut (stretched) so that it doesn't bunch up. Check that the fabric is smooth - wrinkles will spoil the end look.
Be sure to work around the elastic part that holds the mask to your head––it needs to be able to stretch normally still.

, This is the piece that hides the back and sides of your head and joins to the front mask, completing the mask piece.


Place the mask down on a wider and higher piece of material.
Trace a wide oval or circle around the mask, leaving at least 4 inches/10cm space between the edges of the mask and the circle or oval circumference, with slightly longer for the portion that goes down your neck (the part that tucks into the shirt). The back piece fabric needs to be large to ensure a good fit. Use your own head size to guide the final measurements.

, Overlap the top edge of the back piece (opposite end of the part you've designated as the neck end) to the back of the mask behind the forehead.


Continue gluing down the sides of the mask to the chin. This completes the back piece; the remaining unglued length at the base will tuck into the neck cover when assembling the mask.

, This part isn't essential if you find that you can see through the fabric but test it to see. Only do this if you can't see through the fabric. If there is any risk of the fabric running once pierced, seal the circle edges with glue or sew around the border with invisible thread (a very fiddly job).

,


Cut a length of fabric from the stretchy white fabric that is wide enough to roll around your neck and cover the neck into the shirt collar. Glue this piece into a stretchy tube.

, This piece covers the other two pieces for smoothing over the whole look.

, For wearing, simply add the separate items as follows:


Put the face mask on first. Adjust for comfort.
Put the neck cover or dickey on next. Push it down to the neck zone and tuck the ends under the shirt.
Finish with the pantyhose leg. This should cover both the mask and the neck cover, to provide a smooth finish.

Purchase or make swim fins.,
Make your pattern.,
Cut the fabric.,
Sew the tail.",How to Make a Mermaid Tail1," Swim fins are similar to diving fins but are designed to enforce and enable the dolphin-kick style of swimming. They provide greater resistance and thus a greater workout, making them an excellent exercise method. Monofins are swim fins with a single blade, which hold the feet together to encourage proper swimming form.


It will be easiest to purchase a monofin style swim fin but a monofin can also be created by duct-taping together single swim fins or making a monofin completely from scratch. The latter two methods are not recommended but are certainly possible if a monofin is not available.






Monofins and other swim fins can be purchased at swimming and sports stores, as well as online. make sure to buy from a brand that can insure that they can are good to not break when you swim in them as cheap fins can fall apart or be uncomfortable or simply not work for swimming.
Try it on. The foot pockets come in two styles: one with a single pocket and built-in heel and one with no heel and a strap to secure the fin to the foot. Either style should feel secure when you kick but it should not pinch or chafe. Your feet should feel comfortable and flexible.;
, With the monofin on, you can simply trace the shape of your legs and the fin onto cardstock or cardboard or you can measure yourself and create the pattern from the measurements. If tracing, get help from a friend. Making a pattern from measurements will require more math but will also be more accurate.


In order to make a pattern from measurements, measure the circumference (in other words, all the way around) your waist, hips mid-thigh, knees, upper calves, and ankles, as well as take the dimensions of the monofin. Then measure the length between each section (knee to upper calf, upper calf to ankle, etc.). Divide the circumference numbers in half and then draw your pattern, ensuring the width of each section is the same as the halved width measurements as well as ensuring that the distance between each section is the same as the length measurements you took. The monofin can probably be traced directly onto the pattern separately from your legs, once you know where the feet will be.
You may wish to take measurements at more points along your body to ensure a more accurate shape, however, the swim fabric used to create the tail is usually stretchy and will generally conform to your shape so it does not need to be perfect.
For the pattern, you can draw it with a seam allowance or without. If you do not draw it with the seam allowance, make sure that when you cut the fabric you do leave room for the seam. Normally, it is better to not make a pattern with the seam allowance, as you can use the lines as a guide when sewing.
There are multiple ways to do the fin. The easiest method is probably to leave a few inches of fabric at the bottom, along the bottom edge of the fin, and to leave the bottom open. This will allow you to put the material on like a skirt and then the fins, stretching the fabric over the fins once they are on. The excess fabric at the bottom can be cut to look like the uneven edges of a fish fin. Another method would be to have a zipper along the bottom fin edge, and a clean line. The last method would be to have a single seam all the way around, but this will make it more difficult to get in and out of the tail, as well as creating the difficulty of getting the monofin inside the fabric. This will only work if you have a fin that is in two sections and is fairly flexible. Decide which method is best for your needs and skills and make sure your pattern accounts for the method you have chosen.

, First, you must buy fabric. Try local sewing and craft stores or look online to find fabrics. Use stretchy material suitable for going in water, namely nylon spandex. Look for fabrics labeled as swimsuit material. Thicker material is better than thinner material, as it will give a more flesh-like appearance.


Fold the fabric in two, so that the sides you want visible are touching, then trace the pattern onto the fabric using sewer’s chalk. A marker or pen can also be used if you do not have chalk, but be aware that the lines may be visible once the fabric is flipped right-side-out. Pin all along the traced line using straight pins so that the two fabrics are solidly joined.






Now, cut the fabric. As stated above, make sure that there is a seam allowance when you cut the fabric. A generous 1” allowance is best with this type of fabric. Cut the fabric using very sharp scissors, preferably sewing shears, or any tool designed for cutting fabric.






Make sure to leave an extra inch or two at the top, where the waist is located, in order to make a hem for the waist. You should also be sure that you cut your fabric appropriately for the method you chose for enclosing the fin.







, Leaving the fabric open at the waist, sew down one side and then the other, following the drawn line of the pattern. Be careful of the straight pins and remove them when they are no longer needed. If you are going to completely enclose the monofin, simply start at the waist and go all the way around until you reach the other side. If you are leaving it open or are using a zipper, do not sew along the bottom edge.


Since the fabric is stretchy, you will need to account for this in how you sew it. Use a ball-point needle on your machine and set the machine for a stretch stitch, if possible. If your machine does not have a stretch stitch, use a zigzag stitch. You do not want to use a straight stitch, since this stitch will break when the fabric is stretched. Make sure you also have the tension on the foot set a little bit looser than normal.When you are done with the sides, put in the zipper if you are using one. Sew the hem of the waist and the flip the fabric right-side-out. Now you are done!

Make your pattern.,
Cut your fabric.,
Sew the skirt.,
Make the fins.,
Make the waistband.",How to Make a Mermaid Tail2," Make a pattern for a long tube skirt on a piece of cardboard of heavy cardstock. This skirt can be more form-fitting or it can be a looser tube. It just depends on your needs and how much measuring you want to do. The bottom should be just above the ankles and the waist can go wherever you want it to.


Measure the circumference of your hips. Leave the waist the same size as the hips. An elastic waistband will serve to create the appropriately sized waist. If you want the skirt to be more form-fitting, you can measure at more points as well. Your thigh, knees, upper and lower calves are also good places to measure. Remember that the closer together your legs are when you take the measurements, the more close-fitting and difficult to walk in the skirt will be. Certain cuts may only be possible if using very stretchy fabric. Also measure the distance between the different sections (waist to hips, hips to thigh, thigh to knee, etc.)
Draw a center line on your pattern, the same length as the distance between your waist and your ankles. Using the measurements you took earlier between the sections, mark these distances along the center line. Then, take the circumference measurements and halve them. Mark the halved measurements at each section line. Now draw the pattern for the skirt.

, Cut the fabric using the pattern you have created. Use a similar method and tools to the those described above for the swim tail. You will want to leave extra fabric at the top near the waist in order to make the waistband and, as above, you will want to leave extra room when cutting the fabric for a seam allowance.

, Using the pattern, sew the skirt in a way similar to the method described for the swimming tail above. Leave the bottom and waist similarly open, but also the last few inches of the sides as well as the top inch. At the bottom, cut from the center of the panels up to the point on the side where the seam stops. This cut should be at an angle in such a way as to create an upside-down triangle shape at the bottom of the skirt.

, This flared section of the skirt should be made out of a different and contrasting fabric to the one used to make the rest of the skirt. This will give it the appearance of fins. The same fabric will be used to create the waistband. Using a lighter colored fabric is recommended but use whatever color combination you like best.

Take a long rectangular piece of fabric, the length of which should be roughly 1.5 to 2 times the distance from the point at the front of the skirt to the point at the back of the skirt, though it can be longer. The longer it is, the fuller the bottom of the skirt will be. This fabric will form one fin. A similarly cut piece will be necessary to form the other side, meaning you will need two pieces total.






Sew these pieces front-to-front with the rest of the skirt, doing one side and then the other, in such a way that it creates a ruffled or pleated effect. This will make the fins appear full and hide imperfections.






Cut the corners of the fin fabric so that they are rounded where they meet in the middle. Depending on the fabric you use, you can give the fins very different looks. If using organza, you can cut a wavy edge onto the fabric and finish it with fray-stopping solution. If using a more solid material, you may wish to hem the edges.







, As stated above, elastic will be used to create a fitted waist. Get a length of elastic and cut it to the size of your waist at the point where the band will be. Then, cut this in half. You may wish to leave a very small amount of slack but it is not absolutely necessary. The elastic should not be stretched when it is measured and cut.


With the skirt inside-out, flip the top of the fabric down about an inch or two to form the waist band. How far down will depend on how much fabric you left when you cut it and what your personal preferences are for the appearance. The open inch at the side seam should allow you to form two tubes. Pin the fabric and sew it so that the tubes are formed.






Now, thread the elastics through the tubes, pinning them at each end. Close the tubes by sewing them together. You should now have a closed, stretchy, complete waistband.






Use the remaining contrast fabric to sew a long, wide tube. It should be equal in circumference to the ungathered waistband. Close the tube and then attach it to the waistband. Pinch and gather the fabric and attach it by sewing a few stitches and a decorative item such as a pearl or shell button at the center and again at the back of the skirt. The fabric can then be gathered and tucked into the waistband or left in a draped appearance. Now the skirt is done!

Bikini top.,
Shell top.,
Custom top.",How to Make a Mermaid Tail3," You can use any bikini top with your new mermaid tail. This can be either a bikini you already own or you can buy one just for the occasion. Stores like Victoria’s Secret and Macy’s often sell bikini tops separately. The color should be chosen to match or complement the tail you have made, in order to give it a natural appearance.

, You can buy or make a shell top. These are easily made by glueing large craft shells to a bikini top. The shells can be painted or left to look natural. If you plan on swimming in this top you will want to use water-resistant glue. You can make a top from just shells and string by drilling holes into the shell but this is uncomfortable and it is easy to break the shell.

, You can use leftover fabric from making your tail to create a top which matches exactly. Many patterns and instructions are available for free online. The style will depend on your needs, personal preference and skill level.

Adding extra fins.,
Adding scales.,
Pearls and starfish.",How to Make a Mermaid Tail4," You can add all sorts of extra details to both the swim tail and the walking tail. Extra fins can be added to both, using contrasting fabric or the same fabric used for the fin. These can be placed along the sides or at the back. Decide in the beginning if you want to place extra fins, as these will need to be accounted for while you are sewing. Look at pictures of fish for inspiration.

, You may wish to paint scales onto your mermaid tail. If your tail is for swimming, make sure a water-resistant paint is used. You can paint the scales with a brush or with a stencil and spray paint. Keep in mind that this can be time consuming and will require some skill in order to look realistic. It may be easier to use a fabric that is pre-printed with a scale pattern.

, You can sew a string of pearls around the waist of your tail or sew craft starfish anywhere that you think looks appropriate. These can be difficult to attach, depending on the materials, but can really serve to complete your look. Both pearls and starfish can also be added to your top or your hair as well.

Know the two things that affect wig price.,
Don't order a size-specific wig.,
Check for quality above all.,
Don't be as accurate as you think you should be.,
Identify where you will purchase the wig.",How to Find a Cosplay Wig," There are two important things that affect the price of a wig. They are:

Wig length: The rule is: The longer the wig, the more expensive it is.
Wig specifics: If the wig is designed for one specific character, it will probably be more expensive. One way to find a cheap wig is to be general. For example, if you're cosplaying as Grell Sutcliff from Black Butler/ Kuroshitsuji, don't search ""Grell Sutcliff Wig."" Instead, search ""Long Red Wig."";
, Buy a wig with straps and hooks that can adjust to the circumference of your head. Failing to do this can run the risk of a wig being the wrong size and you having to send it back., ""Cheap"" shouldn't mean ""bad-quality"". Sure, you're searching for a cheap wig so that you can save money, but don't buy one that is so cheap that it turns out to be a horrible wig. Most cosplay wigs are made out of synthetic hair, which, if bad in quality, can shed, tangle, and tear., A lot of characters have crazy, unrealistic hair. The wigs for these characters can also be crazy and unrealistic. Buying a wig like this just for the sake of accuracy can be a hassle to maintain. For example, Miku Hatsune has thick, blue, floor-length hair. Buying the same wig will be hard to take care of. A similar wig that gives the impression of such hair will work fine., If you're lucky enough to live near a store that sells wigs that are suitable for cosplaying, then take advantage of the convenience and buy your wig there. However, if you don't have this luxury, your next best option is to order the wig online. Some suitable websites include: eBay, Amazon, AliExpress and Happy Cosplay."

Wear the right size.,
Look at a variety of picks.,
Choose metal for a louder sound.,
Go for plastic if you want a softer sound.,
Use a thin finger pick at first.,
Wear a thicker pick for a fast playing style.",How to Wear Finger Picks1," Finger picks usually come in a small, medium, or large size. Wearing a finger pick that is too large or small can be uncomfortable and affect the way you play. It’s ideal to go to a music store to try on the finger pick. If that’s not an option, look for a sizing chart online.You should look for picks made for left hands if you are left-handed.;
, Some finger picks are as cheap as a dollar, but some can be as expensive as $35. It may seem tempting to go for the expensive one to assure a great sound, but that is not always the case. Cheap picks can often be just as good as expensive finger picks.You may want to pay more if you’d prefer handcrafted metal finger picks.

, It’s okay to use metal or plastic picks, but metal picks are ideal if you are going for a specific sound. A metal pick will help you produce a louder and more precise sound. Metal may also be more durable if you play hard and very often., Plastic is softer than metal, so naturally it creates a softer sound with more ease than a metal pick would. Plastic is also a good idea if you plan to make adjustments to your finger pick because they are fairly malleable.It’s also an option to combine plastic and metal fingers since people often wear three picks as they play.

, Thinner picks are great for beginner players because they are lighter. This is good for people that aren’t used to having picks on their fingers. They are also good because they are more flexible than thicker picks, and the flexibility makes it easier to play. Thin picks aren’t just for beginners though. They are good for achieving a delicate sound in your music., Thick picks are great for more advanced players that feel confident with controlling their finger picks. They are also ideal for the faster strumming that is common with banjo playing. You can also use thicker picks if you want a heavier sound."

Take a look at your banjo.,
Notice that the string nearest to you does not run all the way up to the top of the fretboard with the rest, but has its tuning knob in the middle of the neck.,
REMEMBER that string through the tuning process, because otherwise you will get confused and turn the wrong knob for the wrong string.,
It's time to start tuning.,
Look at the five strings at the bottom, and find the center string.,
Follow the middle string to the top of the Banjo, and find its corresponding tuning knob.,Use the same method to tune the adjacent, slightly thinner string to a B (below middle C)

,
The next and last string in that direction is thinner still; tune it to a D.

,
Go back to that first half-length string.,
Finally, grab the adjacent string, (It's the final remaining string you haven't touched; the fattest one).,
Strum a chord.",How to Tune a Five String (American) Banjo," Hold the ""neck"" (the long, narrow part with the strings) in your left hand, with the fat part across your stomach, and look at all five strings.;
, This strange ""5th string"" placement is unique to the banjo, is used to give the Banjo that unique ""roll"" and ""bounce"" to its sound.

, The SECOND string your hand plucks will in fact be the FIRST string on the tuning board, and so on. Follow the strings from bottom to top, and you'll understand.

, The banjo, when tuned, will play an open ""G"" chord. This means, unlike most string instruments, you can just strum without holding any strings, and it will still make a pleasant, ringing harmony.

, This is the first one to tune. You can use many different tools to tune with. The easiest is any mechanical ""tuner"" that tells you when you are above/beneath the pitch. If you don't have one, though, a piano, pitch-pipe, or any other fixed pitch instrument (like an accordion) will do. All you need is a constant, even pitch, plus an half-sensitive ear.

, Keep plucking the string and twiddling the knob, until it is tuned perfectly to a G below middle C, using any of the above methods.

,,, Tune this to a G, a full octave above the first G you tuned.

, This gets tuned to a low D.

, You are DONE!

Place the pick on the end of your index finger.,
Form the pick to your finger.,
Try to bend the blade if you want the pick to curve with your finger.",How to Wear Finger Picks2," You will typically have to adjust the finger pick or picks before playing. To do this, first put the finger pick on the end of your index finger. The collar of the finger pick should be between the end of your finger and the first joint. The part that picks the instrument should be facing down. Musicians will often wear three picks at a time. If that’s the case, put the other two picks on your thumb and middle finger.If you’re wearing three picks, it’s a good idea to use two metal picks and one plastic pick to get a range of sound.
The collar of the pick should not actually be on the joint of your finger.

, First, hold both sides of the collar of the pick with your opposite index finger and thumb. Give the finger pick a squeeze. Squeeze the pick until the pick is snug, but not too tight on your finger.The finger pick should extend slightly past the end of your finger.

, You don’t have to do this if you are happy with the way the pick fits. If you want the pick to bend with the curve of your finger, you will need to bend the blade. You can do this by pushing the end of the pick on a hard surface, like a table, while wearing it.It may be more difficult to bend the pick if it is pretty thick.

"

Move the pick to fit at a slight angle.,
Keep the metal pick clean to avoid scraping sounds.,
Reduce scraping noises in a plastic pick by heating the tip.",How to Wear Finger Picks3," This will allow you to hit the strings of your instrument at a straighter angle. A straight angle will give your music a fuller sound. If the pick isn’t too tight, you should be able to move it to a slight angle. The pick should cover half of the tip of your finger if it is angled correctly., Scraping sounds will happen with metal picks, but you can reduce how often this happens by cleaning them. Use a soft cloth or chamois, which is soft leather. Use the cloth to rub the surface of the pick to keep dirt from building up.It’s also good to keep the strings clean so the pick doesn’t hit a dirty surface.

, This works best with the pick you wear on your thumb. Hold the pick with a pair of pliers. Dip the flat edge of the pick in boiling water, and hold it there for 10 seconds. Then, take it out of the water and twist the edge slightly while it’s hot. This will make the edge of the pick flat against the string, reducing the scraping noise."

Listen to different banjo music to select what type of banjo you'd like to play.,
Select a clawhammer, or frailing banjo, if you like the old time banjo sound.,
Choose a Bluegrass banjo if you want to play bluegrass music.,
Pick a plectrum or tenor banjo if you want to play with a flat pick.,
Decide on a hybrid banjo if you like the combination of banjo and uke (banjo-uke), banjo and mandolin (banjolin) or banjo and bass (banjo-bass).",How to Buy Your First Banjo1," When buying a beginner banjo, you want to purchase the right style of banjo. There are basically 4 types of banjos, and each has a unique sound and playing style.;
,


Clawhammer banjos have 5 strings and an open back. They weigh less than other banjos because they do not have a resonator.
Frailing banjo style is played with the thumb and back nail of your first or middle finger. The banjo strings are spaced wider than other banjos so you can pluck the individual strings with the back of your finger or thumb.
Clawhammer banjos have a higher action, the distance between the strings and fret board, than other banjos.

, A Bluegrass beginner banjo has 5 strings and a resonator, which makes them heavier and louder.


Bluegrass banjo strings are closer together and the action is lower than a clawhammer banjo.
Bluegrass banjo style is played with 2 finger picks and a thumb pick. Picks slip onto your finger and produce a louder sound than a fingernail.

, Flat picks are the type of picks used with a guitar or mandolin.


Plectrum and tenor banjo style is used to play jazz music or rock and roll.
Plectrum and tenor banjos have 4 strings and come with an open back or with a resonator.

, Basically, these banjo styles provide the drum head of the banjo with the string count, tuning and neck length of the other instrument.

"
"
Play as many banjos as you can before you decide on buying one.,
Look for a banjo that has strings that push down without much effort.,
Pluck the strings near the bridge to judge the tone quality.,
Buy a beginner banjo that you can afford.",How to Buy Your First Banjo2," If you can't play at all, ask the owner of the banjo to play it for you. Every beginner banjo has a unique sound quality.

, You shouldn't have to apply too much pressure when you make a chord.

, When buying your first banjo, you want an instrument with a pleasing sound. You should not have to hit the strings hard to hear it.

,


There are many banjos on the market, ranging from $150 to $10,000.
You don't want to spend a lot of money on an instrument and then decide you don't want to play. On the other hand, when buying your first banjo, you don't want to purchase an inexpensive banjo that is difficult to play and sounds horrible.
Student style banjos range from $250 to $500. These are good instruments to learn on, and as you get better on the banjo, you can upgrade to a more expensive banjo later on.

"
"
Choose the number of strings.,
Decide on an open-back or resonator banjo.,
Find the best action and scale for you.,
Consider other styles.",How to Play a Banjo1," Banjos are a versatile instrument available in multiple flavors. Among the string-options for banjos are a 4-string, 5-string, or 6-string. Choose which one fits you best based on the style of music you are interested in playing and how advanced of a player you consider yourself.


The 4-string or tenor banjo is often associated with dixieland/jazz or Irish music. You can certainly play more than just these styles on a 4-string though. They offer a great choice for beginners, because of the simplicity of the instrument.
The 5-string banjo is the most popular, and most traditional, of all the banjo styles. It is most closely associated with bluegrass and folk styles of banjo-playing, but can be used to play most styles of music. The 5-string banjo is known for its odd fifth string which attaches near the halfway point of neck, a characteristic it inherited from its African predecessors. This is the best option for beginning banjo players, as it offers ease with an extended range of available notes.
The 6-string banjo, or banjo-guitar (banjitar or guitjo) has a banjo body with a guitar neck. It is the least common of these three styles and is most often used by experienced guitar players who want to produce the sound of a banjo while continuing to use their familiar guitar fret positions. It offers the widest range of notes but is also the most difficult to play and is inconsistent with 'regular' banjos, making it a poor choice for first-time students.;
, Banjos come in two main builds, either with an open-back or a resonator attached. The open-back banjo is exactly as it sounds: the drum like cover of the banjo has no back, so it makes a bowl-shape when upside down. A resonator banjo has an attached back and ring of wood which amplifies the sound.


It is best to make the decision on which build of banjo you want after playing both at a local music store. They each offer slightly different sounds because of their construction.
Open-back banjos are most often used by beginners, as they are typically the cheapest option and not as loud. Since they are lighter and quieter, they are often a good choice for learning and practicing. Some traditional banjo songs and playing-styles favor open-back banjos. If you want to play in a bluegrass band, however, an open-back banjo may not be the best choice.
Banjos with a resonator produce a louder, fuller sound, with longer sustain, but are heavier and more expensive. If you are ready and willing to commit to playing the banjo for a long time, you may consider investing in a resonator banjo.
It is said that the heavier a banjo is, the better the quality of the instrument. However, don’t let that deter you from selecting a banjo that might be lighter., The action of the banjo is the distance of the strings to the fingerboard, while the scale is the total length of the strings from the nut to the bridge.


Choose a banjo with a low action to make playing easier. If the action is too high, you will have to press down on the strings which can push the notes out of tune and put uncomfortable pressure on your fingers.
The scale on a banjo can range anywhere from 23”-32”, but the easiest one for beginners to start on is the 26 ¼” banjo. This is neither overwhelmingly long or uncomfortably short, but sits happily in the middle.

, Although the aforementioned items are important to consider when you are looking into buying a banjo, there are a few more options to contemplate. You may consider purchasing a plectrum banjo, which is played with a special pick, or possibly a banjo with a tone ring which enhances the sound. Meet with a local banjo enthusiast or employee at your favorite music store to find out which style fits your preferences.

Figure out the basic materials you will need.,
Decide how large you are going to make your banjo.,
Mark two circles the diameter you want the banjo's body to be.,
Scribe a line about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) inside your first cut, so the finished plywood will form a ring.,
Sand or otherwise fit the two plywood rings so that they match closely.,
Attach two stacked spacer blocks at 5 or 6 locations around one of your rings, then place the other ring on top, and fasten through the top ring and spacers into the bottom ring using wood screws, and preferably, wood glue.,
Cut a piece of finished grade plywood to fit one side of your sound box.,
Cut a piece of 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) Masonite composite sheeting or other material to wrap this assembly.,
Cut your banjo's neck from a piece of 2X4 lumber.,
Cut out the end piece for the banjo neck, tapering it from about 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) in with, 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in thickness, 4 or 4 1⁄2 inches (10.2 or 11.4 cm) long.,
Stretch the drum material over the face of the sound box, tacking or screwing the material you use to side.,
Attach eye screws at the end piece of the neck for the number of strings you intend to use.,
Cut lengths of string for stringing the instrument.,
Cut blocks of wood about 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) wide and 2 inches (5.1 cm) or so long, for frets, tapering them so the tops will be narrow when they are attached to the banjo neck.,
Cut an extra block in the previous step to attach to the diaphragm .,
Sand or use a block plane to smooth and/or round any rough edges that will be exposed, then finish the wood with stain and varnish, paint, plastic decals, or any other method you choose.,
Tune and play around with your banjo, keeping in mind that the original instruments were made from gourds and bamboo limbs, with animal skin thongs for strings, fashioned with hand tools, and evolved into the chrome and lacquer descendants you see in professional musician's hands today.

",How to Make a Banjo for Fun," The one in the photographs uses 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) scrap plywood, 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) Masonite composite board, and 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) Lauan plywood.;
, Since you need to be able to scribe a pretty neat circle, you may want to use an inverted 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket, as in the photograph.

, Cut these with a jigsaw, following the line as closely as possible, since these will be mated pieces.


Other approaches:
Cut the circle with router or bandsaw instead.
Make or purchase a circle-cutting jig for better accuracy.
Use a plastic bucket or a tambourine as the banjo soundbox.
, Leave some wider places on opposite sides for attaching the instrument's neck. Cut these with your jigsaw, as well as some blocks about two inches long and 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) wide on roughly the same radius for spacers.

, If they are not very round, make marks on their edges, so they can be refitted in the same position when they are fastened together permanently.

, Note that this forms a structural round box (the banjo's sound box) so it should be solidly assembled.

, You can scribe it with the box itself, or the bucket or other item you originally scribed the first rings with, and if you like, allow it to be slightly oversized so it can be sanded to fit nicely.

, Attach one end near where you think the instrument's neck will be attached, then wrap it around the frame, securing it will glue and small wood screws.

, Make it about 24–26 inches (61.0–66.0 cm) long, tapered from 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) on one end to about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) on the other. Attach this to the sound box through one of the blocking spacers you have previously added, using heavy wood screws pre-drilled through the sound box. Bevel the last two inches of the opposite end to attach the end piece.

, Attach this with two wood screws, keeping it aligned with the neck.

, Plastic, fabric, or even natural animal membrane can be used for this. In the example in the pictures, a faux leather was purchased for this purpose. Note that the material must be stretched very tightly.


Materials Pros and Cons:Clear plastic: Bright, loud, thin sound. Can make it yourself by cutting a large PET-01 plastic bottle.Frosted top plastic: Common choice for bluegrass. Crisp notes with less sustain than clear plastic.Fiberskyn: warmer, old-time ""plunky"" sound, but fairly versatile.Calfskin: the original old-time classic, but expensive and vulnerable to humidity.
, Attach a simple block on the end of the sound box opposite the neck, and attach eye screws here, also. Do not tighten these screws all the way down, as they may need to have space on the screw thread to turn for tuning the banjo (tightening the strings).

, You will need to cut them a few inches longer than the distance from the eye screws on each end, allowing for tying a simple knot to secure them. Use varying sizes of string, for example, if you use nylon monofilament fishing line, use 100 pound, 60 pound, 30 pound, and 15 pound test lines, to vary the pitch of each. Larger diameter (higher pound test) lines will produce a lower pitched sound, and adjusting the tightness of these strings by twisting the eye screws allowing the strings to wrap the shank will fine-tune the pitch.


Store-bought alternatives:Metal: Banjos use plain metal for most strings, so the material advertised is only a wrapping on the fourth string. Phosphor bronze is warmer, while stainless steel and nickel-plated steel are brighter.Nylgut: a synthetic imitation of gut strings; warmer and quieter than other materials. May snap if they hit a sharp edge.
, These can be spaced depending on your preference, but experiment to locate a convenient fingering location, which will depend on how you grip the neck when playing.

, This will bridge the gap between the strings and the diaphragm, transmitting vibrations from the strings, which are acoustically modified and amplified by it.

, Keep in mind, this is intended to be a fun project, so limit the amount of rules you impose on yourself.

Tune your banjo.,
Adjust your body.,
Get your hands in the right place.,
Learn how to pick.,
Learn some basic rolls.,
Practice your rhythm.,
Learn more advanced music.,
Practice daily.",How to Play a Banjo2," Before you can begin to play the banjo, you need to make sure it is in tune. Twisting the tuner knobs at the headstock of the banjo changes the length and tension of the string, which alters the sound (the tighter and shorter the string, the higher the pitch, and vice versa).


Use an electric tuner. Banjos require a chromatic tuner, but these are easy to order online or purchase from a local music supply store.
If you have a piano or keyboard, play the key on the piano of the string you are tuning and twist the tuner counterclockwise if it is flat, and clockwise if it is sharp. This might be more difficult for beginners as you are essentially playing by ear, but it can help you to know what sound the banjo should make when it is both in and out of tune.

For 5-string banjo: the most common tuning is Open G (g,D,G,B,D).

For tenor banjo: the most common tunings are GDAE or CGDA.

For plectrum banjo: the most common tuning is CGBD

Use an online banjo tuner to hear what these sound like., It is very important that you have the correct posture before playing the banjo. Sitting in the wrong pose can greatly alter the sound of your music, increase the difficulty, and make it more likely that you will hurt yourself.


Always keep your shoulders up and back, without slouching. This applies if you are sitting or standing.
Hold the banjo at a 45 degree angle or higher (many players hold the neck at what is called the eleven, or one-o-clock position, as shown in section 8 below), with the bottom-side being perpendicular to the ground, or slightly rotated upward so you can clearly see the strings.
Be careful not to grip the neck too tight because unlike a guitar, a banjo has a rather sensitive neck. Holding it too tight can make your notes go out of tune.Use a banjo strap. Banjos are heavy and often have longer necks than guitars. You want the strap to carry the weight of the banjo. If your left hand or thumb is busy supporting the weight of the banjo, you will find it difficult to correctly fret the instrument, and it will be forever trying to slide away from you.

, Your right hand should be resting above the strings near the bridge, while your left hand is holding the neck.


Your pinky and ring finger on your right hand should be resting against the head of the banjo, just past the first string. If you have difficulty keeping them there while you play, try adding a piece of double-stick tape to help hold your fingers in place.
The image above shows left-hand placement for guitars. The weight of a banjo should be carried by the strap- not by your thumb. A banjo neck should maintain its position when you release both of your hands. Keep your thumb straight and positioned on the 'crown' of the backside of the neck, then reach your fingers around to the fingerboard on the front. Hold this position of your wrist while you play., When you pick at the strings using bluegrass style, sweep your fingers downwards using your nail or pick to pluck the strings. For a banjo, you will generally use your thumb, index, and middle finger for picking. Some people pluck with all three fingers (except the pinky), but this is considered an advanced technique that you may keep in mind for the future. Your ring and/or pinky finger should remain on the head of the banjo.


You can buy finger picks to slide on the tips of your fingers. They are like metal guitar picks with rings attached that you slide onto the ends of your plucking fingers, and are responsible for creating a louder sound.
Don’t worry about pulling or pushing the strings to pick, as it is unnecessary. The banjo will create a good sound just by softly hitting each string with a lateral, downward or upward stroke.

, Rolls are a term that describe a basic banjo-picking pattern performed in eighth notes. There are many basic rolls to choose from, and they all work by having only your right hand pick at a few strings in a repetitive pattern.


A forward roll is the most basic, and is played by hitting the strings in this order: 5-3-1-5-3-1-5-3. The numbers refer to the string: fifth string, third string, and first string. You see that there are eight notes to be played, so that the roll takes up exactly one measure of music.
Once you have learned a basic roll, work your way up into more difficult rolls to practice your picking and timing.

, Although you might have some rolls down, keeping time while playing them for an extended period can be very difficult. Practice your timing by using a metronome. A metronome is a gadget that emits electronic clicking noises at a certain, consistent rate. Have one going while you practice so that you can rate yourself based on the metronome’s timing., Once you feel you know several rolls, have your timing and rhythm down, and are ready to move forward, look into learning some songs. It may take a few weeks of practicing before you play anything recognizable, but don’t let that discourage you.


Look up famous banjo songs online to learn how to play them. Many music books are also available which teach you how to master some basic songs.
You can search for banjo tabs to get music for many popular songs. A tab is like music for a banjo, telling you what string number and fret creates the notes you need. Search the name of your song with the word “tab” to get the music for it.

, The most important part of learning to play any instrument is to put in regular effort. To become a good banjo player, it is important that you spend at least thirty minutes a day practicing your skill. It may be frustrating or discouraging at first, but over time you will grow to love playing it on a daily basis.

Understand standard tuning.,
Use a note generator.,
Play the base note on a well tuned piano.,
Tune your first string.",How to Tune a Ukulele by Ear1," The ukulele is typically played in its standard tuning of GCEA. The best place to start tuning the ukulele is with the leftmost, G string. There are different types of ukuleles that are tuned to a different sequence:


The baritone ukulele is tuned in DGBE.
Soprano ukuleles are tuned to ADF#B.
Concert ukuleles are similar to the soprano ukuleles’ tuning. Many also like to play the concert ukulele in CGDA.;
, The best way to train your ear is to hear the note you’re tuning to. For this example, use standard tuning, GCEA, and seek out tuning the G string. If the generator is electric, select the G note. It will produce the G tone without any tonal decay. Listen to the note for a few moments, turn it off, and then playback the note again. This will reinforce the tone into your brain.


There are free websites that have note generators and tuners available.
Note generators can be found on most tuners and can be bought at music stores. Sound generators are good tools to train your ears and are often used by choirs.
A chromatic tuner with a note generator is the most resourceful tool for training your ears.

, If you have access to a well-tuned piano, you can use this instead of a note generator to find a base note. The piano is one of the most common tuners through music history. You can play any note on the piano and match it on the ukulele. If you are completely unfamiliar with the notes on a piano, use a different system.


You’ll need to be able to locate the G on the piano.

, Take some time listening to the notes from either the note generator or the piano. Compare that sound to the pitch of your G string. If it doesn’t sound right, you’ll need to spend time matching the notes. The best way to get a good start is by tuning the string too low. It is easier for your ears to match the note while tuning higher.


Once your G string is tuned you can tune the rest of the strings based off this tuning using your ears.
Feel the notes and the rhythms they are sending off. The tuned string shouldn’t produce any dissonant vibrations."
"
Understand tuning the ukulele.,
Tune the C string.,
Tune the E string.,
Tune the A string.,
Test each string.",How to Tune a Ukulele by Ear2," You can tune the ukulele with nothing but the instrument and your ears. Each string contains all 12 notes. You can use one tuned string to tune another string. It is all about knowing where the notes are on the frets.


Frets are the metal wires that go along the neck. You create different notes by pressing your fingers right above the frets., Once you’ve tuned the G string, you should be able to tune the rest of the ukulele to match the G string. Play the fifth fret on the G string; this is a C. Play both the fifth fret on the G string and the open C string. Tune the C string downwards and then tune upwards until the two strings are in tune.


Take some time and use your ears to help you determine what sounds identical.
You aren’t using your ears to make the strings sound good together, but instead matching the strings., Play the 4th fret on the C string. This is the E string. Play both strings as you did with the C string. Listen to determine if the strings are in tune. If not, adjust the open E string until it matches the other string perfectly.


Pluck the fourth fret on the C string and then pluck the open E string. It helps to pause between plucking the two strings to hear the distinction.

, The final string will also be tuned in the same fashion. The A note is located on the fifth fret of the E string. Play the fifth fret of the E string and then play the A string. Again, it will help to tune down, or lower in pitch, a ways and match the note while tuning upwards., The best way to test the tuning is by playing a chord, such as a C major chord. The only note you need to hold down with your fingers is the third fret of the A string. Play the chord once and decide if it sounds in tune.


If something sounds off, play each string in the chord position until you isolate the out of tune string.
You can also use a tuner to double check if everything is in tune.

Use a tuner.,
Practice the ukulele often.,
Match a pitch with your voice.,
Play with other musicians.",How to Tune a Ukulele by Ear3," Not everybody can start off by using their ears alone. Once you have trained your ears, tuning by ear is faster than using a tuner, but you need to work your way there. Use a chromatic tuner to tune the ukulele to the standard tuning.

, Attempt to play the ukulele everyday for at least 15 minutes. You don’t need to spend an hour everyday, but it will help you out if you do. Once you commit yourself to playing the ukulele regularly, you’ll develop a keener sense of what the ukulele ‘’should’’ sound like.


Use a chromatic tuner before practicing.

, The ability to sing a melody or rhythm will help your mind be able to play an instrument better. Listen to the notes of your ukulele on a tuner, or tone generator, and try to sing them. Spend a couple minutes everyday matching your voice to the pitch until it sounds perfect. This type of practice will improve your ears over time., Once you get into the habit of playing with other musicians, you’ll be forced to stay in tune. You can even tune to the other musicians instruments by asking them to play a note, and then tuning to their instrument. Playing with others increases your ears ability to hear out of tune notes.


Start a jam session by tuning to your chromatic tuner and see if you can tell, after thirty minutes of jamming, if you are still in tune.

Tune the C string.",How to Tune a Ukulele," The most common ukuleles, the soprano and tenor ukuleles, have their 4 strings tuned GCEA: the G below middle C (low G), middle C, E, and A. Each string is tensed or loosened with a tuning knob at the top of the fretboard.;
, To refer to the strings on your ukulele correctly, hold it with the fret board pointing up. The lower left of the 4 tuning pegs tunes the G string, the peg above it tunes the C string, the upper right peg tunes the E string, and the peg below it tunes the A string.


The pegs are what you will turn in order to change the pitch of the strings. Which direction you turn them can often vary between instruments, so experiment. Directionality is usually the same for the pegs on a single side of the instrument.
Tighten the strings to raise the pitch. Loosen the strings to lower the pitch.
Absolutely do not tighten the strings too much. This can break your instrument, and the strings may snap off.

, The strings are numbered from the furthest away to the closest to you, assuming you play the ukulele right-handed. The first string is the A string, the second the E string, the third the C string, and the fourth the G string.

, Frets are numbered from the tuning knobs to the sounding board, with the fret nearest the knobs labeled the first fret. Pressing a string against a fret when you pluck it raises the pitch of the string.

, The easiest way to tune your ukulele is to tune its strings to match the pitch of another musical instrument. You have several options: a piano, an online tuner, an electronic tuner, or a pipe tuner. You can tune just a single string this way (and tune the rest based on that string) or you can tune all the strings using a tuning instrument.

, You press the keys and strum the corresponding strings, adjusting the knobs until the ukulele string pitch matches that of the key.

, You can use either a round chromatic pitch pipe or a pitch pipe made especially for the ukulele, which resembles a small pan pipe. Blow into the pipe or opening corresponding to the ukulele string, strum the string, and then adjust the knob until the string's pitch matches that of the pipe.

, If you have a tuning fork for each string, you can strike each fork and adjust the string until its pitch matches that of the fork. If you have only 1 fork, use it to tune 1 of the strings and then tune the other strings against that one.

, Electronic tuners come in 2 types. One type of tuner plays a tone you have to match; the other analyzes the pitch of the string and tells whether the string is sharp (pitched too high) or flat (pitched too low). This is probably the most helpful tuning method for beginners, who have a hard time telling the difference between pitches.

, Tune the G string (the closest string to you) until it is in tune.

, Place your finger on the second fret (second open space from the top) on the tuned G string. This note should be an A, and the same pitch as the string furthest from you.

, Tune the A string according to the note you found on your G string.

, Place your finger on the third fret on the E string. This should be a G note and match your G string. If they don't match, your E string is probably out of tune.

, Tune the E string until it matches the G string.

, Place your finger on the fourth fret on the C strong. This should be E.

, Tune the C string until it is matched to the E string.

Get access to a didgeridoo.,
Find a peaceful location.,
Choose a playing position.,
Establish your hand grip.,
Adopt a calm mindset.",How to Play the Didgeridoo1," Many players begin with a plastic didj. They are relatively inexpensive and you can find one online to purchase very easily. Others prefer to go directly to a wood didj. Even then you will want to consider your budget and the type of wood that you would like, such as agave. Wood didgeridoos are less likely to break and create a deeper, richer sound when played.Some music stores rent didgeridoos and, if you take a class, you may be able to borrow one during the sessions. Be aware, however, that most serious didj players recommend purchasing a personal instrument to make regular practicing easier.;
, It is best to play and practice in an area where you will not be disturbed. This is especially important if you are practicing breathing techniques. You also need to be able to hear yourself play. This sounds easier than it is. The vibrations from the didj will muffle your hearing making it more difficult to identify particular notes or sounds.Some say that the bathroom is the ideal place to play the didgeridoo due to the amplified acoustics. The tile etc., helps to magnify the sound., You can stand or sit in a chair or on the ground. Most people prefer the sitting position as it is easier to maintain for long periods of time. If you are sitting on the ground you can rest your didj on the top of your bare foot. Try to avoid resting your didj directly on the ground. This helps to keep the sound clear and undistorted.In all positions, make sure to maintain proper posture. Keep your back straight and your shoulder back. Slumping over can hurt your ability to move air effectively up from your lungs into your instrument.

, Not matter which position you choose, your grip remains the same. Cradle the didgeridoo in the upturned palm of your dominant hand. Your index finger should be pointing away from you, leaving your thumb and remaining fingers to curl around the didj. Slide this hand down until it is a relaxed arm’s reach out. The other hand can be used to balance the didj close to the mouthpiece, if needed., Playing the didgeridoo is often compared with meditation or spiritual experiences. Keeping your mind clear and focusing on playing the didj will allow you to reap all of the possible mental benefits. Tell yourself, “Be calm,” before sitting down and playing. And, if other thoughts intrude, put down your didj until you can re-focus.It might help to say, ""This is my time to play,"" aloud if you feel distracted. You can also ask your fellow players to keep you on task by having them alert you if you seem unfocused.
You can also lower the lights a bit and maybe light some candles or incense to create a calming environment for playing your didj.

Develop and practice your base drone apart from your didj.,
Place your lips on the didj.,
Tighten or loosen your lips.,
Engage your tongue and cheeks.,
Involve your diaphragm.,
Experiment with unique vocalizations.",How to Play the Didgeridoo2," The base drone is the foundation upon which all didj sounds are built. You will keep droning, even as you add other sounds into the mix. Relax your lips and blow through them causing them to vibrate. Some would liken this to “giving a raspberry” or imitating a horse blowing air out of its mouth.


This will be similar to, but not exactly, like a brass musician preparing to play. Your lips will need to be a bit looser than a trumpet player's.
It may be helpful to practice in front of mirror.

, When you feel like you can hold your drone for 20 seconds or so, go ahead and put your mouth against the opening of your didgeridoo. Your lips should lay firmly, but not inflexibly, against the mouthpiece. They’ll need to move without letting any air out.


You don’t have to directly align your lips with the mouthpiece. Some people prefer to play from the side of their mouth.You can add beeswax to your mouthpiece to make it softer and to create a better seal. Warm up the wax until it is malleable, add it to the rim, and adjust to create an opening hole. Keep in mind that the larger the hole, the more air that is required to play. Most people learning using a 3cm diameter center hole.You can continue to adjust the wax as you play., Once you begin your drone, you can alter the sound by consciously altering the tension in your lips. The sound will also give you feedback. For example, if your lips are too tight then the didj will emit a higher, trumpeting sound. Drop your jaw and move away from a smile to hear a more soothing tone in a lower register., Tap your tongue on your teeth. Quickly push your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Roll your tongue as if you are trying to say an extended “r” in Spanish. Wave your tongue from side to side in your mouth. Allow your cheeks to puff out a bit with extra air. Alternate cheeks for additional sound changes.


Be careful to continue your base drone as you make these adjustments.
Make all of these movements quickly and methodically. If you linger too long on any one movement, you could possibly kill off your drone by stopping the air flow.Puffing out your cheeks will result in a more even sound whereas tightening them with sharpen it., The diaphragm is a muscle that helps to push air in and out of your lungs. The diaphragm is powerful and can create short bursts of air that will, in turn, create a pulsing sound in your didj. To do this try making a “ha…ha…ha” or laughing noise without using your actual voice. You can do this softly or forcefully., Keep a steady drone and then get creative with your tones and sounds. Form your mouth as if you were about to say a letter, such as “A,” then keep the drone going and see how that changes the harmonics. Try repeating various vowels combos, like “AOE.” This will require that you carefully monitor your breathing.It is also quite common to make animal sounds on the didj. Try a bark for dingo. Or, maybe a more complex “kuku” noise for the Kukubarra."
"
Pay attention to your current breathing patterns.,
Understand the mechanics of circular breathing.,
Practice circular breathing with water.,
Practice circular breathing with inflated cheeks.,
Find your breathing rhythm with the didj.,
Enhance your lung capacity.",How to Play the Didgeridoo3," Sit down and take a handful of deep breaths. Focus in on how the air flows through your body and how you exhale. Do you naturally inhale with your mouth? Do you automatically exhale through your nose? As you head toward a nose-centered breathing technique this will help you to identify your strengths and weaknesses., The goal is to maintain a continual, uninterrupted air supply while playing the didgeridoo. You will pull air in with your nose while simultaneously pushing air out through your mouth into the didj mouthpiece. You will also continue to drone throughout this process.With circular breathing you consider the air that you breath in and the air in your mouth as two different entities. They should both feel as if they are never empty and consistently in motion. Establishing a rhythm is important here.One of the keys is to resist blowing the air out of your mouth. That will empty your lungs and stop the drone. Instead, slowly push the air out of your mouth mimicking the same motion as you would when spitting out water., Before you are ready to hit the didj, you need to practice. Get a straw and a glass of water. Place the straw in the water and put your lips the tip of the straw. Inhale through your nose while blowing bubbles in the water. Try to keep the bubbles constant as they represent the constancy of your drone. Repeat this multiple times a day until it becomes easy.Another way to practice is to drink and hold water in your mouth until your cheeks puff out. Then, slowly spit the water out of your mouth. Inhale through your nose as you do this. Your tongue should keep you from gagging or swallowing the water. It is easy to practice this one in the shower., Without the didj, simulate your breathing movements. Breath in until your cheeks are full. Keep inhaling through your nose as you push the air out of your mouth. Be controlled in these movements., Apply your circular breathing techniques when playing the didgeridoo. Keep up the inhale/push out rhythm while maintaining your drone. Avoid incorporating any extra sounds until you have a good handle on the breathing. If your breath is holding steady, the didj will sound steady and full of air as well.You should not expect to master circular breathing right away. It is generally one of the more frustrating parts of learning to play the didgeridoo. Keep working on your breathing but recognize that you can still play the didj without holding long notes., Inhale in a controlled manner until your lungs feel full. Hold this air in for one second before exhaling slowing until your lungs feel totally drained. Pause for a second and repeat. Do this exercise for 10-15 minutes every day and you will see results.You can also improve your lung capacity by avoiding smoking and regularly exercising.

"
"
Keep practicing.,
Record yourself.,
Take a class.",How to Play the Didgeridoo4," As it is with any instrument, practice is key when learning the didj. Play as often as you can. Challenge yourself with new sounds and holding positions. Gather up an audience and play for them and get feedback. Once you gain the confidence even an open-mic night becomes a possibility., If you are not comfortable playing for others face-to-face, you can record your sounds and place them online at a didj forum. Find a forum such as this by entering “didgeridoo forum” into a search engine. If you post a clip you could receive feedback from other players. Or, you could record your playing simply for yourself as a way to self-critique., To receive more in-depth instruction, enroll in an online class or take a course at your local college, if offered.Some of these classes are offered by musicians for free and others require a fee so investigate before signing up. These classes often incorporate the history of the didj as well, which can add another layer to your experience."

Buy a length of 1-1/2"" PVC pipe from five to six feet long.,
Buy a Female-Female 1-1/2"" coupler piece, and a 1-1/2"" to 1"" bushing.,
Clean the cut edges of the PVC pipe.,
Assemble your instrument.",How to Make a Didgeridoo out of PVC Pipe," The length will determine the pitch of your didgeridoo. It's easier to estimate longer, you can always cut it down. A length of 51.5"" (including the mouthpiece) will tune your didgeridoo to a low C.;
, This will make the mouthpiece.

, These tend to send off ribbons and hangnails that will only impede your airways. A wire brush is ideal for this task, but you can shave off excess PVC with a pocketknife if need be.

, Place the coupling firmly onto the end of the pipe. Fit the bushing into the coupling. You now have an assembled didgeridoo!

Play a chromatic scale.,
Listen for fuzziness.,
Notice if there’s extra resistance.",How to Identify Leaking Pads on Your Woodwind Instrument1," You can sometimes tell if your instrument has a leaky pad from the sound quality of the notes that you play on it. Playing a chromatic scale can help determine if there is a problem because they contain 12 pitches that are each a semitone apart. That provides plenty of opportunity to listen for abnormalities with the notes., While you’re playing the scale, pay careful attention to the sound of each note. On a woodwind without leaking pads, they’ll sound clear and crisp. However, if there is a leak, the notes will have a fuzzy, almost blurred sound even with very little finger pressure.Not all leaky pads will lead to fuzzy-sounding notes, so it’s a good idea to check your instrument using an additional method to ensure that your instrument is in proper working order.

, In addition to changing the sound of your instrument, leaky pads may make it feel differently when you’re playing it. You may suddenly notice that your instrument seems to play with greater resistance, which means that you need to blow harder into it to generate enough air pressure.Greater resistance in your woodwind instrument can also be indicative of other issues, so you should check the pads using another method to ensure that they’re the problem.

Get a flexible LED flashlight.,
Place the light inside the instrument.,
Press down on each key.",How to Identify Leaking Pads on Your Woodwind Instrument2," You need a light that will travel down inside your instrument, so a tube flashlight that you can easily bend works best. Look at your local hardware or home improvement store, or search online at sites such as Amazon to find one that will work. Streamlight offers a variety of models that make good leak lights.A length of rope lighting, which is typically used for decorative purposes, can also make an effective leak light.
Using a leak light is an especially effective method for finding leaky pads in woodwinds that don’t break down into separate joints, such as the flute and saxophone, because it allows you to examine all the way down into the body of the instrument.

, Make sure that you’ve turned your leak light on, and gently being threading it down into the instrument. You can either allow it to move all the way to the bottom keys and carefully pull it up as you go to examine each pad, or set it near the top keys and slowly move it down into the instrument as you go., To test each pad, you’ll need to close each key and form a tight seal with the pad. Your leak light should be directly behind the pad that you’re testing. Once you’ve pressed down on the key, look around it to see if you observe any light shining through. Light indicates a leak.It’s usually easier to see if there’s light around a pad if you do the test in a dark or dimly lit room.
While this method can be very effective in identifying significant leaks, it may not alert you to smaller issues. It also won’t help you determine if the pad is seated evenly around the tone hole.
Using a leak light won’t work if your woodwind instrument has translucent pads because the light will be visible even if there isn’t a leak.

Cut a strip of thin paper.,
Place the paper under the pad.,
Pull on the paper.",How to Identify Leaking Pads on Your Woodwind Instrument3," You want to use paper that’s as thin as possible, so tobacco rolling paper works well. When you’re cutting the paper, the strip should be very narrow, approximately ¼-inch wide. It’s a good idea to taper the strip, though, so you’ll have a thicker portion that’s easier to grip with your fingers. You don’t need to make it too long -- 3 to 4 inches is sufficient.If you don’t have tobacco paper on hand, tissue paper, cellophane wrappers from food or other products, or store receipts are effective alternatives.
If you want to make it even easier to grab the paper, attach a thin stick, such as a chopstick, to the end of the paper to create a handle., Make sure that you set the thinner end of the strip over the tone hole, and gently close the pad over it. The paper should be sandwiched between the pad and tone hole, but the wide edge should hang over the edge so you can grip it with your fingers., Grasp the wide end of the strip, and carefully tug on it. As you pull, pay attention to the amount of drag or resistance that you feel. If you can pull the paper out easily, you’ve identified the leak.You should repeat this process at four different spots around the pad to check for a leak all the way around.

Separate the joints of the clarinet.,
Seal bottom.,
Release your hand.",How to Identify Leaking Pads on Your Woodwind Instrument4," You’ll need to check each one separately to test for leaks. Because it requires separating the pieces, this method obviously won’t work for saxophones or flutes. Take the upper joint first, and close all of the keys., You need to make the joint airtight, so seal the far end with your free hand. Remove the air that’s already in the joint by sucking it out through the near end. Try to get as much air out as possible, so you create a suction effect inside the joint., When you let go of the bottom of the joint, you’ll hear a crisp popping sound if the pads are leak-free. If you don’t hear a pop or you need to apply extra pressure to achieve the sound, then there is a leak in the joint.You should repeat the process on the lower joint to check it for leaks.
Because this process doesn’t identify the specific pad that’s leaking, you’ll want to follow up by using a leak light or feeler paper to find it.

Make or buy a Cross Academy day class or night class uniform (in the latest chapters, she finally got a night class uniform).,
Get the jewelry.,
Attain Yuuki's hair.,
Yuuki has an average-sized chest.,
Wear burgundy hued contact lenses if you don't have brown eyes.,
Have somebody cosplay as Zero or Kaname and hang around them.,
Be cheerful, kind, and act slightly air-headed.,
Smile and be nice to people.,
Be a little indecisive.,
Have a strong attachment with your close friends.

,
Yuuki is super protective over Zero, so if you have someone you're extremely close to, exhibit protectiveness over this person.

",How to Cosplay As Yuuki Cross from Vampire Knight," You can do so by looking at some pictures of Yuuki and sewing it yourself. If you aren't keen on sewing, ask a friend or family member who is proficient in the skill to make the costume for you. You can also buy it online at a cosplay shop. If you want to cosplay Yuuki in her academy dress, her multiple artwork dresses, or her winter cloak, buy it or sew it after seeing reference pictures. Remember that she likes to dress in soft pastel colors.;
, Yuuki is seen wearing a necklace with the crest of her school. Also, she wears a small metal bracelet that allows her to control Zero. You might also want to get her staff/scythe, Artemis. Otherwise, she is seen with detailed jewelry and clothing in several artworks.

, Have medium-length, brown hair or get a wig. Unless you want to cosplay Yuuki as a vampire, then you need long brown hair down to your lower back. You can also buy a wig for that as well. Remember that she likes to wear cute ""Alice bands"" in her hair, mostly in pastel colors.

, If you have very large breasts, you may want to bind them but it's not really necessary. You could use thin cloth to bind. Don't use bulky cloth because that would make it obvious.

, If you have brown eyes, no need to wear burgundy contacts, but you might like it, though, since her eyes are more reddish brown. To emphasize eyes, wear MAKEUP! Yuuki is a bit of a tomboy, so she's not the type to wear a full face of makeup, but to get those big anime/manga eyes, wear black or brown eyeliner in a anime/manga shape on the upper and lower lash-line, some mascara, and false lashes if you are up to it. Use pictures of Yuuki online for ideas.

, Also, you might like to hang with some Yori or Kaien cosplayers, the people dear to Yuuki. As Yuuki is a very social and talkative person, cos-playing with some others will let you look more like her.

, Yuuki is very naive, comedic, and optimistic, but also very indecisive. Learn about her character and her traits, like being not able to cook something eatable or enjoying parfait.

, Yuuki is known for her kindness and caring nature toward everybody, especially her friends.

, Yuuki's is from time to time fairly insecure due to her missing past so it may help to act this way but don't overdo it. If your going more for vampire Yuuki then don't act indecisive or insecure for that she looses this trait later. Also, be more authoritative.

Choose a vampire you are attracted to and could see yourself dating.,
Embrace Goth culture.,
Get used to seeing your date drink blood.,
Be yourself and share your interests.",How to Date a Vampire," Dating someone who is into the underground vampire culture is like dating the ultimate “bad boy” who lives by his own rules. You need to really feel the attraction in order to take a leap of faith. Several elements to consider include:


Physical appearance: although film and television vampires are undoubtedly the hottest creatures around, make sure you feel a physical attraction to your real life vampire before agreeing to go out for a bite.
Personality: even though he or she may be hot, you will want a vampire who has it all--charm, intellect and a sense of humor. Typically those who dabble in vampirism are pretty open-minded and like to experiment so chances are your date will have something interesting to bring to the date.
Mutual interests: if you are not part of the human vampire world, find common ground with your potential date. Perhaps you both go to the same school or hang out at the same clubs--look for similarities that you share, which can act as a springboard to developing the relationship.;
, Most vampires gravitate toward the entire Goth movement. From dark clothing and brooding music to hanging out in dangerous areas of the city; vampires love to head to the dark and daring side. Ways to assimilate include:


Purchase and learn to appreciate music by Goth bands such as Marilyn Manson or some of the retro groups like Bauhaus, Depeche Mode or The Sisters of Mercy.
Check out Goth fashion. Generally dark, sweeping clothing with almost a medieval appeal meets Goth fashion approval. Doc Martin boots, black nail polish, ripped fishnet stockings, heavy black eyeliner and shiny black hair are also appropriate.
Consider piercings. A big part of vampirism is achievement of pleasure through pain. Piercings allow your vampire date to experience ecstasy through the pain of being pierced in numerous areas of the body. If you consider a new piercing for yourself start slow and be deliberate about which area of your body you pierce. The good news about piercings is if you don’t like it, you can always let the hole heal.
Avoid the sun. In line with fable Dracula, modern-day vampires avoid the sun as much as possible. Slather up with SPF 50 when you go outside during the day and consider carrying a black-fringed parasol with you for extra protection. The upside to ditching your summer tan is that being pale reduces your risk of skin cancer.

, A huge part of the vampire culture is actually drinking blood. Human vampires will use a clean scalpel or a knife to make a small incision on his or her “victim’s” body before actually drinking the blood that is oozing from the wound. While most likely neither safe or sanitary, if your date wants to drink your blood:


Politely decline. Numerous deadly diseases, like HIV and Hepatitis B can be transmitted through cutting yourself and then allowing another person to drink your blood (and vice versa). Instead of putting yourself in harm’s way, tell him or her that you would rather not partake in this aspect of vampirism, but are o.k. if he or she wants to find someone else to snack on.
Excuse yourself from the room. Unless you are completely fine witnessing someone drinking blood from another person, you may want to leave the room to avoid passing out or looking disgusted. If blood drinking is the only aspect that turns you off about your vampire date, politely excuse yourself and wait in the other room until he or she finishes--then go back to your date.
Watch and take notes. If you think blood drinking looks cool, ask your date if you can remain in the room and watch as he or she performs the ritual of cutting another person and then drinking blood.

, Just because you are dating someone who is into vampirism, it doesn’t mean that it has to be a one-sided relationship. While you can learn to appreciate Goth and tolerate blood drinking, it doesn’t mean that you have to lose yourself in the relationship. Bring your personality and quirkiness to the table and introduce your date to activities that hold your interest. A true gage of whether your date could turn into a steady is how he or she reacts to learning more about what you like to do.

",How to Fix a Crack in Your Ukulele," If it wasn't a mechanical damage and one day you just discovered a crack or a few on the surface of your uke having no idea what happened, it's likely due to a lack of humidity.


If you've got a solid wood ukulele, it requires special treatment, like all solid wood instruments. Get a uke case (if you don't have one already) and a case humidifier ASAP.;
, Cover your working surface with an old newspaper or something to protect it from accidental drops of glue.

, If the crack is on the side, then you'll have to use your knees as such.

, Wipe away any dirt, oil, or whatever might have stuck to your uke during its use with a clean, slightly wet piece of cloth. Wipe again with a clean dry cloth.

, Some people use a special wood glue that is widely used for the musical instrument repairs; you can look the brands up online. Some prefer hide glue, but it's a lot of work to make it. It comes in dry crystals and you have to actually ""cook"" it.

, Extend it a bit further on both sides. Make sure it coats the crack well, but don't pour too much.

, All the way down the crack and back, and repeat a few times. That will allow the glue to get into the crack even if it's very small.

, Then remove the remaining glue from the surface of the instrument with a wet (and well-wringed out) piece of cloth. Make sure to wipe the uke well, because the remaining glue might leave slight traces when dried.

, Then put it in the case with a humidifier. It's usually recommended that you don't touch the glued details for 12-18 hours, so just leave it in the case.

, It is important to get and keep the entire edge in contact with the stone at this stage. You may need to angle the handle somewhat in relation to the stone in order to achieve this.

, If your knife has previously been sharpened, you may need to tilt the blade a significant angle (45+ degrees). While an angle of about 20-25 degrees is the preferred bevel for knives, the critical angle is determined by the current status of your knife's bevel.

, Try to keep the angle of the knife constant. If you are trying to reduce the angle of your knife's bevel, you made have to spend some time (30-40 minutes) grinding the blade in this manner until the front part of the edge starts to make contact with the stone. Only then will a burr begin to form.

,, You may have to repeat steps 5 and 6 one or more times if your knife needs serious attention.

,,, Tilt the back of the knife up slightly and very lightly draw the blade diagonally toward you along the length of the stone about 3-6 times so as to allow the entire edge to come into contact with the stone. Lift the blade each time you retake a stroke. Adjust the angle of the blade until you feel the burr ""pull"" against the stone. **I cannot emphasize enough how lightly you must lay the blade on the stone for this and the following steps. No pressure beyond virtually the weight of the knife is required.

, **Remember, use only the weight of the knife and be careful not to sharpen at an angle higher than necessary: the burr will ""pull"" slightly.

, There are treble recorders for any budget, both plastic and wooden. A wooden one will have much nicer tone, but it will cost a lot more money. If you're starting out, it's probably best to buy a plastic one, in case you decide at a later date that you don't like it. An additional concern when buying is that a plastic one will remain to be useful when you upgrade (it's very good for practicing on), whereas a cheaper wooden one will not. It's always best to buy the best you can afford, but a good plastic will be a better option than a cheap wooden one.

, Unlike the descant (soprano) recorder, the treble will invariably come disassembled in a case. It comes in three parts: the the head joint (into which you blow), the body (which contains most of the fingering holes), and the foot joint. Ensure that the foot joint is skewed slightly to the right, so that when your fingers cover all of the holes, your little finger rests easily over the final hole.

, Your left thumb should cover the hole on the underside of the body and your middle three fingers should cover the holes on top. Your little finger should be free. The thumb of your right hand should balance the recorder and the remaining fingers should cover the remaining holes.

, This is the note E. Try getting someone to play that note on the piano. If you're higher than the piano, you're blowing too hard and if you're lower then you're blowing too softly. Experiment until you find the right amount to blow.

, Before playing any note, pronounce a ""doo"" sound, so that your tongue touches the roof of your mouth. This produces a much clearer note.

, Once again, check if you're blowing the right amount by testing the note on a piano.

, Check if you're blowing the right amount by testing the note on a piano again, but you should be starting to get a feel for the amount you need to blow to play a note in tune.

, Play a C, then put the forefinger and middle finger of your right hand on their holes. You should have 5 holes (and the underneath hole) covered.

, This note requires less air pressure than previous notes, so make sure that you don't blow too hard.

, This note requires still less air pressure than G, so make sure that you don't blow too hard. This is the lowest note on the treble recorder.

, Moving from E to F (as is common) takes some getting used to, and is quite difficult to get smooth. Practice it. You will learn an alternative fingering for E later to accommodate this, but if possible, always try to use the E fingering above. High F is also known as F' .

, You may have wondered why B was missed out earlier. This is because Bb makes up the F major scale, and is therefore taught before B (since the treble recorder is an ""F"" recorder). Further, it is more difficult because it is a ""forked note"", meaning the middle finger is off the hole, but the forefinger and ring finger are on the holes. So, play a low F and remove the middle finger of your right hand.

, Simply play F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F' and then back down.

, This will take some practice to make sure that the recorder is properly balanced and that you get a nice even tone. Try playing it against the piano, to check tuning. High G is also known as G' .

, Play a High G and then add your forefinger, remembering to keep your thumb off its hole. A very common trill is F# to G, and on recorder, this is exceptionally easy. Just quickly take your forefinger off the hole and put it back, without tonguing each time. High F# is also known as F#' .

, Play a note G and remove the forefinger of your right hand. You can trill between C and B really easily by just pulling your middle and ring fingers up and down quickly without tonguing.

, Simply play G, A, B, C, D, E, F#', G' and then back down.

, Play a note E and add the middle finger of your left hand and the forefinger of your right hand.

, Play G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F#', G' going up and G', F', Eb, D, C, Bb, A, G going down.

, To get high notes, one must employ a technique called ""pinching"", which involves your thumb. Simply slip the tip of your thumb inside the thumb hole. Practice moving your thumb in this way, between pinched and non-pinched, because you will have to do this a lot.

, Play an A, but instead of covering the hole with your thumb, pinch it, as explained above. It should sound an octave higher than the lower A. Practice moving between A and High A (A'), remembering to tongue every time. Check your tuning on the piano.

, Play a G but remove your thumb and the forefinger of your left hand. This note is quite difficult, but necessary for the next two scales.

, Play A, B, C, D, E, F#', G#', A' going up, then A', G', F', E, D, C, B, A going down.

, Play an A and remove the ring finger of your left hand. Then, notice that there are two holes under the ring finger of your right hand. Cover the rightmost one of these. This will take some practice. Try moving from C# to D. Check your tuning on a piano.

, Play A, B, C#, D, E, F#', G#', A' and then back down again.

, Play a High A, remove the middle finger of your right hand and add your right hand's ring finger. Remember not to add your right hand's little finger as you did with regular Bb.

, Play Bb, C, D, Eb, F', G', A', Bb' and then back down again.

Purchase a recorder.,
Assemble the recorder.,
Learn how to hold the recorder.",How to Play the Recorder1," If you are a complete beginner, you can start by purchasing an inexpensive plastic recorder. Plastic recorders are usually used for teaching school children, as they require very little effort to maintain.


Once you have mastered the basics and you are still interested in playing, you can consider upgrading to a more expensive, wooden version. Wooden recorders tend to have a more pleasant tone than their plastic counterparts, but are considerably more difficult to care for.
Both wooden and plastic recorders can be found at good musical instrument stores, or online.;
, Recorders usually come in three parts, the top part which has the mouthpiece, the middle part with finger holes and the bottom part which has a bell shape. Gently twist the pieces together.


The bottom piece should be turned so the hole is slightly to the right when viewed as you would play it.
Some recorders, typically those used in schools, are only one piece.

, Pick up the recorder and place the mouthpiece on your lips. Gently hold it between your lips and balance it with your fingers. Remember to put your left hand at the top.


The back side with one hole should face you. The front side should face away from you.
Do not bite the mouthpiece or allow it to touch your teeth.

Decide when to change the strings.,
Pick the right length:

If you have a Soprano (Standard) ukulele, you should buy a 21"" string.,
Consider your material.,
Knot the string.,
Wind the string knot around itself one to three times.,
Pull the end of the string toward the head of the ukulele and pull it through the metal pin of the tuning peg.,
Tune your ukulele.",How to Change a Ukulele String," You'll want to change the strings on your ukulele if one of these apply:

The tuning accuracy down the neck differs.
The strings buzz when they didn't before.
You run your fingers under the strings and can feel dents where the frets have damaged the strings.
The string has snapped.
The strings are peeling.;
,
If you have a Concert-sized ukulele, you should buy a 23"" string.
If you have a Tenor ukulele, you should buy a 26"" string.
If you have a Baritone ukulele, you should buy a 30"" string.

, There are many different types of materials used to make ukulele strings.

Nylon is often used because of its round and warm sound which mimics the sound of gut strings. It also provides tuning stability and resistance to humidity.
Fluorocarbon strings provide an even fuller sound than nylon string and reacts less to temperature change.
Titanium strings offer strength and durability with a louder and brighter sound.
Steel strings can be used on the ukulele, but it not recommended as it may cause damage to the bridge and neck of the instrument.

, Before tying the string to the ukulele, you need to create a knot in the string.

First, make a simple knot in the string.
Make a loop.
Overlap the loop on the knot, pulling it downward.
Tighten the loop on the knot.

, The number depends on how your bridge was made. Larger tie blocks can take up to three loops on the thinner strings while narrow tie blocks usually take only two. The fatter strings on the ukulele usually only wrap around once or twice., Then pull the string taut and set it into the notch in the nut., You can check out How to Tune a Ukulele for how to do that."

Practice blowing into the recorder.,
Learn the correct tonguing technique.,
Play your first note.,
Understand the fingering chart.,
Learn the left hand notes.,
Learn the right hand notes.,
Practice playing simple songs.",How to Play the Recorder2," Blow into the recorder to get an idea of how it will sound. You will need to blow gently. Think about blowing bubbles as you do this. Blowing softly with a steady stream of air is one of the most difficult but important techniques as you begin to play recorder.


If you blow too hard, you will produce a sharp, unpleasant sound. Blow more gently in order to produce a musical sound.
Breathe from the diaphragm and make sure you blow evenly. It will help to keep the sound consistent.

, When playing a note on the recorder, you should start and stop the sound with your tongue. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth behind your teeth. The sound should start and stop there.In order to do this, try saying the word ""ta"" or ""too"" as you play the note. This technique is called tonguing and produces a clear start and end to the note.
Be careful not to vocalize the ""ta"" or ""too"" sound when you're playing. These words should just be used to help you master the correct tonguing technique.

, The first note that people usually learn is B. This requires that you cover the back hole with your left thumb. Now take your left index finger and cover the first hole on the uppermost side under the mouthpiece. Use your right thumb to balance the recorder. Now blow gently into the mouthpiece, remembering to say ""ta"" or ""too"". Well done! The sound you just made was a B note.If the note does not come out, or it squeaks, make sure that your fingers are fully covering the holes, and that your fingers stay flat.
Another reason it might squeak is because you're blowing into it too hard.
Keep practicing B until you are comfortable with it.

, A simple fingering chart is used to represent the notes on a recorder. The fingering chart consists of numbers 0 through 7, with 0 representing the left thumb, 1 representing the left index finger, 2 representing the second left finger, and so on.


For example, the B note you just played would be represented on the fingering chart as follows:

0 1 - - - - - -


The numbers represent the holes that are being covered, while the dashes represent the holes that remain uncovered. In this instance, the 0 indicates that your thumb is covering the hole on the back of the recorder, while the 1 shows that your left index finger is covering the first hole. , The first notes that you will learn to play using your left hand are B (which you just played), A and G. The next two notes that you will play with your left hand are C' and D'. The apostrophe at the top right hand corner of these notes indicates that they are high notes.



To play A: Use the same positioning as for a B note, but this time place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for an A note is: 0 12 - - - - -

To play G: Use the same positioning as for an A note, but this time place your left ring finger on the third hole from the top. The fingering chart for a G note is: 0 123 - - - -

To play C': Cover the back hole with your left thumb, then place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for C' is: 0 - 2 - - - - -

To play D': Leave the back hole uncovered and place your left middle finger on the second hole from the top. The fingering chart for D' is: - - 2 - - - - -

, The first notes that you will learn to play using your right hand are E, D and F#. The next two notes that you will learn to play with your right hand are F and C. These two notes can be a little tricky for new players as lot of holes need to be covered at once when playing them.



To play E: Cover the back hole with your left thumb, cover the top three holes with your left index, middle and ring fingers, then place your right index finger on the fourth hole from the top and your right middle finger on the fifth hole from the top. The fingering chart for an E note is: 0 123 45 - -

To play D: Use the same positioning as for an E note, but this time place your right ring finger on the sixth hole from the top. The fingering chart for a D note is: 0 123 456 -

To play F#: Use the same positioning as for a D note, but this time remove your right index finger from the fourth hole from the top, leaving all other fingers in place. The fingering chart for an F# is: 0 123 - 56 -

To play F: Place your left thumb on the back hole, the index, middle and ring fingers of your left hand on the top three holes, the index finger of your right hand on the fourth hole, the ring finger of your right hand on the sixth hole, and the baby finger of your right hand on the seventh hole. The fingering chart for an F is: 0 123 4 - 67

To play C: When playing a C, all seven holes are covered. Your left thumb will cover the bottom hole, the index, middle and ring fingers of your left hand will cover the top three holes and the index, middle, ring and baby fingers of your right hand will cover the bottom four. The fingering chart for a C is: 0 123 4567

, Once you have mastered all of these notes, you can put them together to play a few simple songs:Mary Had a Little Lamb:

B A G A B B B
A A A
B D' D'
B A G A B B B
A A B A G



Twinkle Twinkle Little Star:

Practice playing high notes.,
Learn the semitones.,
Work on vibrato.,
Use glissandos.",How to Play the Recorder3," These can become a bit tricky. To play notes above D', a technique known as ""pinching the thumb hole"" must be used. Cover 2/3 to 3/4 of the thumb hole using the tip of your thumb. Tighten your lips slightly and blow a little harder than usual.

, A semitone is a sound that's halfway between one note and the next, like the sound made by the black keys on a piano. You have already learned one of the most popular semitones - that is, F#. Two more semitones that you should learn are Bb and C#'.The fingering chart for Bb is: 0 1 - 3 4 - - -
The fingering chart for C#' is: - 12 - - - - -
You can practice these semitone notes by playing a little ditty called Baa Baa Black Sheep:

D D A A B C#' D' B A, G G F# F# E E D



, Once you have mastered the notes, you can work on your vibrato technique. A vibrato allows long notes to resonate, creating a nice dynamic effect. There are several ways to accomplish this:


Use a diaphragmatic vibrato. Control the flow of air into the recorder by tightening and contracting your diaphragm. Say, ""heh heh heh"" but do not cut off the flow of air entirely.
Use a tongued tremolo. Say, ""yer yer yer yer yer yer"" using your tongue to control the airflow.
Use a finger vibrato. While not being a very practical choice for a sustained vibrato, this method is commonly referred to as a trill. Alternately finger the note and the next higher note. Do not tongue each note, but rapidly play an A B A B A B A sequence.

, These are created by sliding the fingers off the recorder in quick succession to create a sliding sound.

Clean your reorder after each use.,
Keep your recorder in a case.,
Protect the recorder from extreme temperatures.,
Learn how to deal with clogging.",How to Play the Recorder4," It is important to keep your instrument clean both for hygiene reasons and to keep the recorder in good playing condition.


Plastic recorders can be washed in the dishwasher or in a sink with warm soapy water. Take the pieces apart before washing and be sure to rinse all the soap off.
The mouthpiece can be cleaned with an old toothbrush or pipe cleaner.
Let your recorder dry completely before playing again.
For wooden recorders, disassemble the recorder and carefully wipe the moisture off the inside with a soft cloth.

, Keep the recorder in its case when not in use to prevent chipping or damaging the whistle-like hole at the top, because damage there can render the whole recorder useless.

, Protect your instrument against sudden changes of temperature or direct sunlight, and never leave it in a warm car or near a source of heat. This is particularly important for wooden recorders, but is good practice for any instrument., Condensation of beads of moisture in the windway of the recorder can cause clogging. You can minimize clogging in both plastic and wooden recorders by warming the head joint up to body temperature in your hands, under your arm, or in your pocket before playing.


If water has accumulated in the windway, completely cover the window at the top of the recorder with the one hand and exhale forcefully into the windway. This should clear out any excess moisture.
If clogging persists, you can clean the windway by mixing one tablespoon of unperfumed dishwasher detergent with three tablespoons of water. Pour this cleaner into the recorder, either through the window or at the bottom, and leave it to sit in the windway for a moment before draining. Allow the recorder to dry completely before you play it again."

See if you can comfortably reach your left thumb to the speaker keys (A, C and D) and the whisper key, without uncovering the note of C.Bassoons equipped with hole covers for “E” and “C” can help smaller hands.There are models specially made to accommodate small hands, although these may not be as readily available.;
, You’ll need ready access to a bassoon and bassoon reeds, both of which are costly. Even the lower cost bassoons are thousands of dollars, so many students start on school-owned instruments.A bassoon uses a double reed – two pieces of bamboo tied together that vibrate when blown into.The reeds cost about $10-15 each, and you should keep a supply of at least three to four quality reeds on hand.Reeds can break easily. If you care for them well and handle them gently, a good reed can last about a month. If you take a reed out carelessly, it can chip before you ever get the chance to use it. You want to make sure that you keep your reeds inside a special bassoon reed case so that they can be protected from being bumped but still dry out. Also when you use a reed it's good to alternate between 2-3 reeds so that they have time to dry out before their next use.Bassoons come in wood or plastic material. You may be able to achieve a warmer tone with a wood bassoon. Plastic versions tend to be less expensive., Depending on your age group, your peers might view the bassoon as odd or comical.It has a large, interesting shape and can emit humorous sounds. This can especially be an issue in secondary school. However, the bassoon is not a commonly recognized instrument and therefore people of various age groups may crack jokes about it.If you plan to love your instrument regardless of other people’s comments and opinions, the bassoon may be right for you.

, The bassoon is one of the hardest instruments to play – even music teachers struggle with it.Learning to play a complex instrument requires a lot of effort. For instance, expert bassoonists practice one to three hours a day or more.You may want to split up your practice time. For example, two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening.

, The right instrument for you should be enjoyable and practical for you as an individual. There are many other instruments you can choose from! You may even experiment with various instruments until you find the one that resonates with you the most.

, Having good reeds is one of the most important considerations when playing the bassoon. You can save money by making your own reeds, but it is a time-consuming process. Your reeds should not have cracks in them. All of the wires should be intact.You should look for professional, handmade reeds rather than machine-produced reeds.Try premade reeds when you’re just starting out. You don’t want to invest the time it takes to learn about making your own reeds (and invest in the necessary equipment) if you end up deciding not to be a bassoonist.
If you’ve decided to stick with the bassoon, consider making your own reeds. You can purchase reed making kits. Alternately, you can gather the materials for finishing your own reeds by acquiring a reed knife, mandrel, reamer, plaque, small rat-tail file, fine flat file, fine sandpaper, small pliers, small block of hardwood, and cane. Some of these items can be found in hardware stores, and others you can look for at local music stores or online., Your reed case should be ventilated with holes to prevent mildew. If your reeds came in an airtight plastic container, don’t use that for storing your reeds. Avoid cases with plastic foam or cotton cushioning, which can promote mildew.Look for a reed case that can store at least three reeds and has mandrels for mounting them.
Wood or tin cases that hold reeds securely work well.

, A reed soaker is a sealable container that you fill with water and use to soak your reed before using it to play your instrument. You can purchase a container for soaking reeds, or repurpose a container you already have that will suit the purpose. If you don’t want to get a reed soaker, you can use a faucet to wet your reeds instead.


For example, a small lidded plastic container, an empty pill container with a lid, or an empty film canister will all do the job.
If you’re playing in a school band, you might be required to have a reed soaker on hand. Check with your instructor.

, You should use a swabbing cloth to clean your bassoon every time you finish playing it. You will need a pull through swab, so that it can remove the moisture from inside your bassoon. Get a small brush for dusting under the keys. Pick a brush with natural bristles, not synthetic.Avoid wool swabs which shed fibers and can get stuck in parts of your instrument.Silk swabs are a good choice. Don’t use long “pipe cleaner” swabs.For instance, a paint brush that is one inch wide will work as a dusting brush.

, You will need a seat strap to play the bassoon sitting down. If you want to play it standing up, you’ll need a neck strap also. If your bassoon didn’t come with a seat strap, you can either buy one or make one using an old belt.Cut the buckle off the belt. Use pliers to insert a metal coat hanger through one of the belt holes. Bend the wire until it is the shape of a hook.

, Having a hand rest is optional, however you may need one depending on the length of your hand. If you’re going to use a neck strap, you will need some type of hand support. Select a hand rest with a size and shape that is comfortable for you., The tenons of your bassoon will need to be lubricated. Get paraffin canning wax if you have thread wrapped tenons. If you have corked tenons, get cork grease., Always have a pen or pencil with your music supplies. You will want to mark your music as needed. For example, you can mark upside-down arrows at the points where you should breathe in.

, If the instrument has issues, have it checked by a repair person. The instrument may or may not be repairable, depending upon how long it’s been since the instrument was used, and how severe the damage is.Check for cracks in the body or pieces missing.
Ensure that all of the pads seal, particularly the pads close to the bell.
Check the bocal for dents and fissures.

, Rest the boot on the floor. Be careful not to bend any keys while you are assembling your bassoon. Place the tenor joint into the boot. Line up the bridge post on the side with its mate. If there is a pin attaching the tenor and long joints, unpin it if necessary. Then, carefully slide the long joint in.Make sure to align the bridge key mechanism well or the lower register won’t function.

, Press and hold down the low Bb key. Slide the bell onto the top of the long joint. Then release the key.

, If you have a hand rest, attach it to the boot joint on its female receiver. Situate it however is most comfortable for your hand., Don’t hold the bocal at the end with the reed. Hold the bocal at its curve. Use careful back and forth turns to insert the bocal. The whisper key should align with the bocal vent hole., If you’ll be sitting, connect the seat strap to the bottom of the boot joint. Place it so that the bassoon’s weight is resting on the strap.It’s important to position the seat strap two inches from the front of your chair.If you’ll be standing, use a neck strap instead of a seat strap. Connect the neck strap to the hook at the top of the boot joint., Have firm and upright posture. If you’re sitting, your back should be straight against the back of your chair, with the seat strap beneath you and the boot on your right side.Whether you’re using a neck or a seat strap, adjust the strap so that it supports the reed entering your mouth with your head facing forward. You shouldn’t have to bend to reach the bocal., Soak the reed in water for a few moments. You can do this by submerging it in a reed soaker full of water, or by running it under a faucet. Remove the reed and let the water penetrate it. Carefully place the moist reed at the tip of the bocal and attach it., Don’t wear any type of balm or cosmetics on your lips. Either brush your teeth first or gargle with mouthwash before you play your bassoon. Otherwise, food and bacteria residue can build up on your reeds and affect how they play., Keep your instrument at a 45 degree angle across your body. Holding it straight up can interfere with fingering and playing the lower register., Embouchure refers to the placement of your mouth, lips and tongue when playing an instrument. Place the reed in your mouth. Cover your teeth with your lips, keeping your lips relaxed. Don’t bite down on the reed or flatten out your lips. Imagine that there is a drawstring in your lips, and someone is pulling the string towards the back of your mouth, forming a cushion over the reed with your lips.Your upper lip should almost touch the first wire. Keep your chin muscles stretched downward and your cheeks smooth.Practice in front of a mirror to make sure your embouchure is correct.

, Use the tip of your tongue for articulating; for example, accent and staccato. Think of the way you would move your mouth to say the word “dough.”If you are playing very fast, there is a special method for that called “double tonguing.” Repeatedly make the noises of the letters “d” and “g” in succession inside your mouth, up against the reed.

, Breathe in with your diaphragm and out with your abdominal muscles. To better grasp this technique, try relaxed breathing by lying on your back on the floor (without your bassoon). This is a simple way to observe how you properly breathe with straight posture., Consult a fingering chart and keep it nearby for reference while you are still learning. The whisper key is your left thumb’s home base. Don’t rest your right thumb on the bassoon.If you want to play sheet music, you’ll need to learn music notations. You can learn how to read music and play the bassoon simultaneously by taking lessons.

, Practice fast and slow air flow. This will help you to observe how air stream effects pitch. Blow into the bocal slowly. Then increase your air flow without changing your embouchure.Practice vibrato. Vibrato is when you add pulsing to notes. Try not to use pressure from your jaw to make a vibrato effect. Use your abdomen primarily and your larynx secondarily to create vibrato pulsations., Use a damp cloth to clean the keys after every use. Dust under the keys with a small brush. Wash saliva off the reed with water or by using light sandpaper on it. Every week, wipe down your bassoon with a damp cloth, without wetting the pads. Dry your instrument with a swab cloth. If your bassoon has a wood finish, polish it every two months with furniture polish.Polish silver keys monthly. You should have a professional repair person buff nickel keys annually.
If your instruments’ keys frequently tarnish despite regular cleaning, discuss it with the manufacturer of your bassoon. The climate you play in and the way you play your instrument may be contributing factors.
For bassoons with a plastic finish, you can also use soap and water.

, If there are strings on your tenons, you can grease those as well.Cork wound tenons require a bit more maintenance than thread wrapped tenons. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons.For cork wound tenons, wipe off any old coating of grease. Then apply a thin layer of cork grease every two weeks.
For thread wrapped tenons, warm a cake of canning wax in your hands until it softens. Then add a thin coat of wax onto the threads. Never use cork grease on thread wound tenons.

, Occasionally you will need to adjust your reed when it isn’t sounding right. If the sound is flat, buzzy, or the reed responds too easily, the reed is too soft. If the sound is sharp, muffled, or the reed doesn’t respond well, the reed is too hard.Fix a soft reed by opening the first and second wires carefully with needle-nose pliers. Gently slide the reed through 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper lightly on both sides of the front half.
Fix a hard reed by slightly closing the first and second wires with needle nose pliers. Gently sand both sides of the reed with 600 grit sandpaper. Then use 240 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the back third of of the reed on both sides, while focusing on the reed’s center.

, Every two weeks, apply heavy key oil to pivot screws, and light key oil to long screws. Every week, make sure all screws are tight."

Buy a recorder.,
Familiarize yourself with the things that came with your recorder.,
Learn the basic notes.,
Start with note B.,
Learn notes A and G. Drop your middle finger on the next hole and blow.,
Use both hands now.,
Learn the High C, High D, High E, and Low C.

,
Learn high C. For high C, put your pointer finger on the second hole, leaving the first uncovered, and place your thumb on the back hole.,
Learn high D. High D is played by removing the thumb on the back hole.,
Learn high E. High E is just playing a E, but not blocking the back hole.,
Search on Google Pictures for a song to play.,
Use YouTube to learn by listening to others play.",How to Play the Soprano Recorder," This step may seem simple, but you must chose the correct type. In your music store, there are lots of recorder types. Be sure to buy the one labeled ""Soprano"". You do not have to buy a very expensive one, since it will not create a better sound as a cheap one. A simple plastic recorder with a cleaning stick is what you want, not a super expensive bamboo soprano!;
, You should have a recorder bag to keep your recorder; if not, you can find a substitute at home, or even sew one. The store also should provide you with a ""plastic stick"". That is the cleaning stick, which you put tissue on top of the rounded side and push the stick in to clean your recorder. Keep your stick in your recorder bag. If the store did not supply you with that, use water to clean it by running it through the bottom round hole and blowing from the mouthpiece to dry it.

, You will learn the notes B, A, G, F,E, and D in this category. When you play any note, be sure to cover the whole hole or else the note will be different!

, This one is the most simple note. Simply use your left hand thumb to cover the hole on the back of your recorder and cover the first note in front with your pointer finger. Check for any part of the two holes uncovered, and blow. The note should be high, but not extremely high that it squeaks. If it does, cover the holes again and try again.

, The sound should be a bit lower. For G, let your ring finger fall on the next hole and blow. The sound should decrease to form a lower sound. If it squeaks, don't give up, just try again.

, Don't fret, it's not that hard. Put your right thumb behind the recorder and let your left pinky hang off the recorder. Put your pointer finger on the next uncovered hole and blow. If the F is too high, check  all the fingers. After you are done move onto E; just drop a finger and blow. Repeat to play D.

,, The sound should be high, but not yet squeaky.

, Use your other hand to keep the recorder from slipping out of your fingers. This sound should be even closer to squeaky.

, That sound should be almost the same as a squeaky note, but not yet one.

, Simply type the name of your favorite song and after that, type ""recorder notes"".

, After you have practiced, you could even play with the video!

Start by practicing with a straw.,
Practice next with a head joint.,
Put masking tape over the lip plate.,
Start playing the flute again.,
Work through all of your scales, and if you are able, take them up an extra octave.,
You may have to adjust your embouchure (the hole between your lips when playing) as well as tuning beforehand.,
Practice.",How to Play a Flute with Braces," This can help give you the feel without chomping down on the flute and helps you to gain the needed flexibility with your lips.


Can you draw a circle around the straw using your lips? Give it a try many times.;
, Once the tone is back, practice on a B and extend.

, You can add up to five layers, as needed. This will work wonders to help you.

, Move your upper jaw forward a little, you will have to adjust.

, This will help your range get back to what it used to be if not even higher.

,


Since braces tend to make you loosen the corners of your mouth, a common adjustment is to make sure that the corners of your mouth are turned down and are not loose.

, After your lips adjust a bit to having bulky metal in your mouth, try to practice more than usual. Even if you can't get a good sound, practice, practice, practice! This helps get your lips used to playing again.

Blow into the instrument.,
Place the precorder between your lips, and some people like the mouthpiece half inside their mouth.,
Put the precorder the way you like it and whisper the word ""Too"" into the instrument.,
Play any note except for High D, you need to look on the opposite side of the side with holes and then put your thumb on the one hole there.,
Read your music and get ready to play with the precorder!

",How to Play the Precorder," One way to blow into the instrument is to say the word ""Too"". Then whisper the word ""Too"".;
, Lightly blow into the instrument. If you blow too hard you A. can't hear it or B. Makes a really loud annoying sound. Plus it's a waste of breath.

, Lightly. Or you can hear the T so loud it will ruin the sound of the music. Or, you can just blow regularly into the instrument but remember to keep it light.

, You can't play any notes without your thumb behind there except for High D. Here is how to play all of the notes on a precorder:


High D No holes covered. Just put your thumb in the bump area on the side with the C hole and then you can hold the sides with your other hands.






High C One hole covered. Just cover the one hole on the other side.






B Cover the hole on the other side and the first hole on the side with lots of holes.






A Same way you play B, with another finger on the hole below B.






G Cover the High C and the first three holes.






F Cover the High C and four holes.






E Cover the High C and five holes.






D Cover the High C and all holes covered except the one on the very bottom.






Low C Cover all the holes including the High C hole.

Allow your reed to soak in warm water for at least 3 minutes in a cup.,
Before the reed is inserted into the instrument, blow into it for a few seconds to get the spit/water out, make sure your lips are completely covering your teeth to prevent damage to the reed.,
Place the reed in the center of your lower lip and roll your lip over your teeth so they are just covered.,
If this is your first time playing the oboe, there is an exercise you can do to get used to the reed.,
Continue by inserting the reed into the upper joint.,
Get into a good position to play, as good posture is important for a good sound.,
Place your left hand on the upper joint.,
When you're done playing, you will have some water condensed from your breath left in your instrument.,
And remember, the oboe isn't for everyone.",How to Play the Oboe," Saliva is not good for reeds. Be careful not to soak the reed for too long because then it will be harder to play. While the reed soaks, grasp the bell of the instrument and attach it to the bottom of the main part of the instrument.;
, Crowing it will help warm it up too: this is where you put the reed in your mouth, lips at the top of the string, and blow. After that, take the reed and insert it into the top of the main section of the instrument. Blow into the reed for a few seconds and follow that by a few short bursts of air.

, Close your lips around the reed. The tip of the reed is where you should place your lips. The tip of the reed is a little bit above the middle of it. It is thinner than the rest of the reed.

, Place the tip of your tongue over the opening of the reed. To blow, think of pronouncing the syllable ""doo"" (of course, with your lips still around the reed). If steps 6-8 are performed correctly, a high pitched note will come from the reed. If not, refer to those steps again.

, Apply cork grease, if needed, though don't put too much on or the joints will slip off while you are playing. Obtain a fingering chart from a beginner's oboe book or on a trusted website. An easy note to start with is a middle A or B. For an A, put your right thumb underneath the thumb rest on the lower-half of the oboe. This hand does not push any keys. Your left hand goes on the upper-half of the oboe. The thumb rests on the wood, not the octave key, and the first two holes are covered.

, Put your feet flat on the floor, a straight back and have your oboe facing outward, and away from your knees. The oboe should form an approximately 45 degree angle with your body.

, Your index and middle fingers cover the first two keys that have holes. Make sure the holes are covered. Your thumb goes under the key that is on the back of the instrument, for now.

, Take a weighted swab and pull it through the the top and the middle joint sections of the oboe. The bell, as it as at the end, can look after itself. Then put everything back in your oboe case.

, You must tune with your mouth and reposition your mouth to get the proper sound.

Practice every day (outside of band class) for at least fifteen minutes to develop your basic flute skills.,
Clean the spit out of your flute after every time your practice.,
Take your flute apart and put it away in the case.",How to Play Flute in Elementary School," Some of the schools might provide you with a flute, but if you feel uncomfortable using that, you can always buy one for yourself.;
, Insert the open end of the head joint into the wider end of the body (usually closest to the printed brand name of the instrument). Align the embouchure hole with the first key on the body. Don't push the head joint in all the way, keep it out a little bit; it will be more in tune. Take the foot joint from the case and connect it to the other end of the body. Align the main rod of the foot joint with the last key of the body. Adjust the alignment if needed.

, Glass or plastic works equally well. Blow across the opening to produce a sound. Make sure the opening is not too big. An easy way to learn the flute embouchure is by making an mmm sound, and then a p sound while pursing your lips. However, when playing the flute, you should be making more of a ""too"" sound--not literally saying ""too,"" but blowing with your mouth set as if you were saying, ""too."" You should also be blowing slightly downward in order to make a note. Blow the flute as if you were cooling a warm soup. The less liquid in the bottle the lower the pitch and the more liquid the higher the pitch. This blowing technique is the proper way to ease notes from a flute.

, Try with the head joint only, at first. Place the lip plate just below your lower lip, purse your lips, take a deep breath, and blow as if you were saying ""too"". It will not happen straight away so be patient. Try moving your embouchure hole around. Practice in front of a mirror and look at the shape of your lips. Your embouchure should be about the size of a drinking straw and shaped like a circle or teardrop.
Here's a neat way to work on producing sound:


Press your lips together. Roll the lips inward, so that there is no pink showing.
Kiss your flute--place the embouchure hole completely against your pressed lips, so that you can feel the full circle around your mouth.
Roll the flute away from your lips approximately 90 degrees, so that the embouchure hole is now level with the ceiling.
Pretend to spit out a watermelon seed!(Try not to spit into the bottle or flute if you are using it) This may assist you in finding a good embouchure shape. If you achieve a sound using this method, try adding a stream of air after your initial ""spit"".Make sure you don't roll the flute in or it will sound out of tune.

, This way you will be able to recognize the correct embouchure, and what your mouth looks like when you successfully produce a sound.

, Hold the flute with the your mouth on the lip plate and the remainder of the instrument pointing to the right. Your left hand should be nearest the mouthpiece and should be facing towards you from the other side of the flute. Your left thumb should rest on a key. Your right hand should be further down on the flute to the right and should be facing away from you. There is no key for your right thumb. Balance your flute with your right thumb and left index knuckle and not with both thumbs.

, Sit or stand up straight and hold the flute a little below parallel. Your arms should feel relaxed, but they may ache after extended playing. Crossing your legs will often affect your tone if you allow you posture to collapse as well. So keep your feet planted a little apart and flat on the ground. Make sure you keep your chest and head in an upright position to keep your lungs open.

, On one side you might right the note ex. D and the flute fingerings. On the other write the 5 lines and place the note where it should be. For example, D would be on the 4th line.

, For lines remember Every(e), Good(g), Boy(b), Does(d), Fine(F); these are the note names of the lines in ascending order. The spaces spell out F-A-C-E, in ascending order, which is easy to remember because ""space"" rhymes with ""face.""

,, If you can't remember note names for now you can write the letters above notes. (Your book may do this for you to begin with.) But eventually you will need to recognize notes without letters above them.

,, If you never practice, you will never get better.

, (Flutes can grow mold.) First you will have to take your flute apart. Attach a cloth (not your polishing cloth--part of an old t-shirt will do) to your tuning rod--the long metal, wooden, or plastic needle that came with your flute. Push the tuning rod though each part of the flute: head joint, body, and foot joint. You can also buy a swab for this purpose.Cleaning the joints also makes it easier to assemble the flute.

, Twist off the head joint, body, and foot joint gently and put them in the case. Latch the case closed and put it in a safe place, preferably where it will stay at a steady room temperature.

Warm up as you normally would.,
Work on your scales, especially chromatic scales.

,
Examine the music.,
Play a chromatic scale from the first note of the glissando to the last note.,
Play the glissando.,
Keep in rhythm.",How to Play a Glissando on the Flute,";
,, A glissando is indicated by a squiggly line traveling downwards or upwards diagonally. See what note the fall starts on and what it ends on. How long is the starting note?

, Start out slowly and eventually speed up. If you are not as experienced, a simple scale in whatever key the piece is will work, but you should still start and end on the same notes.

, Start on the first note of the glissando and play a chromatic scale down to the last note. The glissando should last as long as the first note is notated. So, if the first note is a half note, the glissando would last two beats. Then play the last note of the glissando for as long as the music indicates.

, You should attack the first note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. You should arrive at and release the second note at the same time as if you were playing no glissando. That means you don't have a lot of time to dwell on all the notes in between. It's more important to keep the notes at either end in time, than to clearly hit every note on the chromatic scale in between.

Use an electronic tuner.,
Tune both piccolos separately first.,
Have both piccolo players play A at the same time once they are tuned.,
Listen as you play and support the air.",How to Tune Two Piccolos," Hardly anyone's ears are good enough to tune a piccolo. They are very accurate and last a long time.;
,


Warm up and try to get your piccolo to the temperature it will be while you are playing it. If the piccolo becomes cold or warm its pitch will fluctuate.
Play your A in both octaves. Make slight adjustments according to the tuner. If you are flat, push in. If you are sharp, pull out.

A slightly unorthodox thing to do is tune to a lower octave D as well.



, Try to adjust to where a straight tone, without pitch wavering, is heard. If there are flute players tune them with the piccolo players as well.

, Piccolos are notorious for going out of tune, and the majority of the time they are flat. This doesn't hold true all of the time, but if you can hear that you are out of tune, especially in higher notes, lip the note up so it is sharper. One way to make yourself do that is to raise your eyebrows. It sounds silly, but it works!

Make sure your flute is working correctly and that all your pads are sealed.,
Play in a medium register to warm up.

,
Drop the corners of your mouth, as if you were frowning.,
Start higher up, and descend on any scale until you reach the desired note.,
Practice and experiment with tone on the lowest notes you can play.,
Work your way toward lower notes a little at a time.

,
Practice playing low notes, starting with a full breath, and maintaining an even tone until the breath is almost gone.,
Consider attending private lessons.,
Pressing the flute closer to your mouth makes low notes clearer.

,
Make sure you are blowing more and slower air that is pointed downward.

,
Make your embouchure is more of an oval shape than a round shape when playing lower notes.,
Practice.,
You should be relaxed at all times, whether you are playing low notes, middle notes, or high notes.

",How to Hit the Lower Notes on a Flute," A friend, teacher, or music shop employee can find out if your flute is fully functional. An instrument repair shop can help identify and correct leaks.;
,, You are always blowing into a flute when playing a note and you need to blow at a steeper downward angle for lower notes.

, Try to crescendo into the note. Also try slurring down from a note a step or so above the note you wish to play.

, Notice what makes them sound fullest and what makes the attacks cleanest.

,, Listen to the sound! Is it full and rich? Thin and metallic? None of these are ""good"" or ""bad"", but thinking about the quality of tone will help you learn to get the sound you want.

, Ask your band teacher or a music shop in order to find a private lesson teacher.

,,, The embouchure for middle range notes should be a bit more circular and high notes should be a small circle.

, Low notes are difficult and you probably will not get them just right on your first try.

Sit or stand in an upright, relaxed position.,
Hold the pan flute with both hands.,
Relax your arms.,
Form the correct embouchure.",How to Play the Panpipe or Pan Flute1," Hold your body upright and stand tall. If you decide to sit, make sure your back is straight so that you will be able to hold the flute in front of your body comfortably.Keep your body relaxed.;
, Hold the long tube end of the flute in a handshake grip with your right hand. Position the flute vertically so that the tubes are parallel to your body. Use your left hand to gently hold the end of the flute with the short tubes.The pan flute is typically curved. Position the flute’s curve toward your body.
Keep the pan flute horizontally aligned with your head. So if your head tilts one way or the other, the flute should also tilt to remain aligned with your head., Keep your arms relaxed as you hold the pan flute. This will allow you to easily move it back and forth so that you can blow into different tubes.

, Your embouchure is the positioning and shaping of your mouth and lips in order to control your airflow when you play a pan flute. To form your embouchure, first make a slight smile and purse your lips a bit.Make a small opening between your lips. Position the pan flute against your bottom lip and direct air into the pipe’s tube, just like you would if you blew into a bottle.


Move the bottom of the flute slightly away from your or closer to you to adjust the direction of the air flow into the tube.
Adjust the position of the tube’s top higher or lower depending on your mouth and lips to produce a good quality sound.Tighten up your lips/embouchure when you are playing the higher notes (shorter tubes). Relax your embouchure when you play lower notes (longer tubes). "

Blow air into the pan flute.,
Pronounce different letters to make different sounds.,
Play half-notes on your pan flute.,
Bend notes on your pan flute.,
Play staccato notes.,
Create a vibrato sound.,
Flutter your tongue while you play.",How to Play the Panpipe or Pan Flute2," Once your body is positioned correctly, you are ready to play the flute. Blow a steady, strong stream of air through your embouchure into one of the pan flute’s tubes.


Make minor adjustments to your embouchure and the flute’s positioning so that you achieve the sound you want.

, When you blow air into the flute, you can alter the resulting sound by moving your tongue to pronounce different consonant letter sounds. The primary letter sound you use when playing a pan flute is a T sound. You can also make B, P, or D sounds to subtly change the pan flute sound., A musical scale has full notes (such as C, B, A) and half-notes (such as C sharp, E flat, and so on). The tubes on a pan flute produce full notes, but you can use different playing techniques to achieve half-notes and therefore expand the repertoire of music you can play. To play half-notes, try one of these techniques:



Tilt the flute: Tilt the bottom of the pan flute away from you so that your lower lip covers part of the tube opening.Draw the flute down slightly against your lip at the same time.

Retract your jaw: You can also retract your jaw to play half-notes. Pull your chin backwards while directing air into one of the tubes., Bending notes are a way to add musicality and depth to your playing. A bent note is one sound that starts as a flat note sound and moves upward to land on the correct note, or a sharp note sound and moves downward to land on the correct note. To bend a note:


Tilt flute away from your body to bend a note downward. Keep the airflow constant., Staccato notes are short, almost sharp sounding notes. These are helpful especially when you are playing fast music. To play a staccato note, pronounce a sharp T sound, bringing your tongue to touch the back of your front teeth quickly., A vibrato is a wavering sound that adds dimension to your playing. Change the strength of the air flow into a tube from strong to weak over and over to add a vibrato, or wavering, sound., You can also get a vibrato sound by moving the pan flute towards and away from your mouth just a slight distance. Do this quickly while keeping the air flow consistent and strong., Fluttering your tongue will create a trilling sound when you play. To do this, vibrate your tongue like a purr or a rolling R. Maintain a strong stream of air across the tube of the pipe."
"
Practice playing scales.,
Practice playing simple songs.,
Practice frequently.,
Practice in front of a mirror.,
Play with a group of pan flutists.",How to Play the Panpipe or Pan Flute3," A musical scale is a set of notes that ascend in order. They can vary depending on the key in which you play. A common scale starts with C and goes up to the next C (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C). Play each note as a separate, clean note.

Practice different techniques while moving up and down the musical scale, working on staccato sounds and vibrato sounds.
Practice a scale with half-notes. On each tube, play the regular note and then play the half note by tilting the flute toward or away from your body.

, Simple songs such as “Mary Had a Little Lamb” will help you learn how to move between different notes and practice different techniques. Playing on a panpipe with 8 pipes, imagine every pipe is numbered 1 to 8. With the pipe up to your mouth, imagine each pipe has a number. The longest pipe is number 1, with each successive pipe as 2, 3, and so on. The shortest pipe is number 8.

Play “Mary Had a Little Lamb” by blowing into the pipe that corresponds to each number: 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, The most surefire way to improve your technique is to practice playing the pan flute frequently. Playing for 30-60 minutes every day will help you grow accustomed to shaping your embouchure

, Use a mirror to observe your technique as you play. Pay attention to the shape of your mouth as you play. Practice changing your embouchure to see what different tones this produces., A good way to improve how you play the pan flute is to play with a group of people who also play. You can learn techniques from other people and they can give you feedback on your technique.

Clean your pan flute after playing.,
Store your pan flute in a padded case.,
Protect your pan flute from sudden temperature changes.,
Smooth the mouthpieces.,
Repair any cracks in the tubes.",How to Play the Panpipe or Pan Flute4," When you play your pan flute, some moisture can build up inside the tubes. After you have finished playing, swab the inside of each tube with a damp soft cloth. Allow the flute to dry before putting it away., Once the flute is dried after playing, store it in a cloth padded case. The cloth should be decently breathable so that any residual moisture can escape. Storing the pan flute in a case will keep it from being exposed to dust and potential damage., Wood instruments are highly susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity. Try to keep your pan flute in a consistent temperature environment. Don’t leave it in a hot car, for example.

, Periodically, the mouthpieces of the pan flute might become rough from frequent playing. Use a tuning rod to smooth down the mouthpieces. Rub a tuning rod across the top of the tubes; this will help smooth down any fibers that are standing up., Cracks and hairline fractures can alter or compromise the sound of a pan flute. Check your flute periodically for cracks or fractures. Patch them up with adhesive tape for a quick fix. Use beeswax to seal up the crack for a long-term repair.Alternately, take the pan flute to a musical instrument repair shop for professional repair.

Understand the order of the notes.,
Start with the fingering of the lowest F. On your left hand, have the first three fingers on (and covering the holes if you have an opened hole flute) and your left hand thumb on your left hand.,
Proceed to G. the fingering is the same as with F, except that you remove your right hand index finger.

,
Play the A.,
Play B-flat, the only flat in the scale.,
Play C. Place your index finger on your left and pinky finger on your right.

,
Play D. Place the second third finger and thumb on your left hand and all four digits on your right.,
Play E. Use your first, second, third fingers and thumb on your left  hand, and first and second fingers on your right hand

,
Come back to F again, but this time one whole octave up.,
Play higher.,
Play G. This is fingered the same and will be just one octave up.,
Play A.,
Play B-flat.,
Play C. This is the same, look above.

,
Play D. This is the second and third fingers and thumb on your left hand and the pinky on your right hand.,
Play E. Make sure that you blow enough air for this E. It can be difficult to master.,
Play F. This is fingered as for the other F except that the second finger on your left hand is up.",How to Play the F Scale on the Flute," The pattern of a major scales is whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step,whole step, and half step. The F major scale notes are F, G, A, B-flat, C, D, E, then F again. You can play this as two octaves, but start with the first octave, the lower one.;
, On your right hand, put down your pinky and your index finger.

,, The same as G except that your third finger on your left hand is up as well.

, Index and thumb down on your left hand and index and pinky down on your right. Make sure that your left thumb is on the lever closest to your right hand. You don't use the other one much, only in specific circumstances.

,, Make sure your first finger is up for D because it only sounds barely different with it down, but it does change the pitch.

,, The fingering is the same, but streamline the air a little more and blow it faster over the mouthpiece.

, The notes are the same as above, just you play them one octave up. Most of them have the same fingering but a few of them are different. If it is the same, the step will mention ""look above"", in reference to the first part above. The F that you start with is the same one that ended the last scale in Part 1.

, Look above.

, This is also the same fingering. Look above.

, This is the same, look above.

,, It can be made using the aforementioned fingering for D but it is hard to do and almost never in tune.

, The fingering is the first two fingers and thumb on your left hand and the first two fingers on your right hand and no pinky.

, Like the D, you can play this as a normal F but it is easier to do with this finger up, and typically more in tune.

Learn to assemble your flute properly.,
Warm up the flute by playing or blowing warm air through it before tuning.,
After each and every playing session, take your flute apart, so that the three pieces are separated.

,
Thread a soft cloth through the needle-like slot in the end of your tuning rod and flip the cloth over the cleaning rod, then wrap it around the rod so that there is none of the rod showing at the top, otherwise, you will scratch the inside of your precious flute.,
Carefully polish the flute with a different cloth - clean all the keys and the bodywork until it's free of fingerprints and other possible gunk.,
Carefully clean the lip plate with the cloth, as this is the most fragile part of the flute.

,
You can use a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove dust and buildup between the keys in those hard to reach spots, but it's not recommended to do this too often.,
Clean your pads if they are sticky from water build up.,
Store and carry your flute in its case, avoiding moisture and temperature extremes.,
Keep your springs in their places and do not mess around with the mechanisms and screws unless you know what you are doing.,
Check your tuning cork periodically.,
Pay attention to your pads.,
Have your flute serviced periodically by somebody who specializes in flutes, or woodwind, at the least.,
Remember: Take care of your flute, and it will take care of you.

",How to Clean and Maintain Your Flute,"


Make sure that the mating surfaces are free of debris and grit.
Line up the joints so that they are straight and gently push them together with a twisting motion. Never force.
If you start having trouble lining them up, gently take off the end that has the problem and clean the joint with a soft cloth, which you should be doing frequently anyway. Never use lipgloss or vaseline to ease the joints of the flute together. It will give you a quick fix, but later down the road will give you much more trouble than it's worth as dust/dirt and grime will build up much quicker when they have something to adhere to.
If you will march with this flute, make sure that the joints are snug enough to prevent parts from flying off when the instrument is snapped up or down, and definitely think twice about joint lubrication. Marching is hard on instruments, so it makes sense to march with a spare instrument if you have one, especially if there is any chance of rain.;
, The pitch will change somewhat with the temperature. If the flute cools off between playing passages, you can warm it up by closing the keys and softly blowing warm air straight into, not across, the hole. Feel free to play scales or some music to make it interesting.

,, Remove the moisture by gently sliding the cleaning rod through each of the sections in the same direction ""without"" using a twisting motion. By twisting the rod and cloth, and if pushing/pulling it back and forth inside your flute, the cloth and rod run the risk of snagging a pad or even getting stuck inside! If you use a cleaning swab or stick, do not store it in the body of the flute; the moisture in it will be absorbed in the pads. Also, never store the cleaning cloths inside the case of the flute, as the pads could, again, absorb the moisture.

, Make sure to always handle the flute by the barrel when cleaning, as to not bend the keys and/or rods. Pay extra attention to the areas between the parts of the flute, as this is where the most gunk usually builds up, but be careful not to damage the keywork when trying to reach these areas. Don't worry if there's still some dust etc., when your flute is professionally cleaned, they will sort this.

,, They also sell small tools for doing this.

, If sticky, they will make a little noise when they lift up. Slide pad paper or a piece of clean cigarette paper under a key, then close the key firmly. Never used the gummed edge of the cigarette paper. Do not use dollar bills--they are filthy! Do not pull the paper out while the key is pressed down, as this will create friction in the pad and bladder of the key. Instead, open the key and then slide the paper out. It will be just as effective and pulling the paper from under the keys, but not nearly as harmful to the pads. The stickiness is due to moisture, so make an effort to keep the flute dry. Use this technique gently and sparingly, since it could damage the thin membrane that makes the seal when you close a key.

, The case is the safest place, but if you play frequently enough and have a safe corner, you might also consider getting a stand for any occasional breaks from practice.

, If a key fails to lift when released, look to see if a spring (one of the tiny wires along the rod) has popped out of place. You may be able to push it back into place with the eraser end of a pencil or some similar, soft instrument. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, take it to a music shop or to an instrument repair shop.

, If your flute is consistently out of tune, check the cork at the top of the head joint. Take the head joint off of the flute, insert your cleaning rod carefully into it upside down. The end of the rod should have a line towards the bottom of it which should appear directly or close enough to the centre of the embouchure hole. If the line is not in the center of the embouchure hole, then it means your cork is slightly out of alignment. Corks that are out of position will cause your flute to not properly play in tune. Do not attempt to solve this yourself by pushing in or pulling out on the cork, as you could cause damage.

, Misaligned keys or deteriorating pads, especially, can mean leaks, which can affect your tone. If you find that you need to press down harder on the keys to get the notes to speak best, you probably have a leak and need some pads replaced at the repair shop.

, There are some problems that develop over time and simply require professional care.

Handle the flute parts with care.,
Swab and clean your flute regularly.",How to Assemble a Flute," A disassembled flute is divided into three pieces of different sizes. You’ll need to learn which is which before you can put your flute together.The headjoint is the top part of the flute, which has the lip plate.
The body of the flute is the central portion, and the largest, with several keys on it.
The footjoint is the smallest part, forming the bottom of the flute.;
, Take the parts of your flute out of the case, one by one. Lift them by their ends only, to avoid damaging them. As you take the parts out of the case, give them a quick wipe down with a polishing cloth to clean them so they’ll fit together properly.


Pay special attention to the ends of the pieces--making sure they are free from dirt will help the flute fit together properly.

, Gently hold the headjoint in one hand and the body in another. Insert the end opposite the lip plate of the headjoint into the end of the body that is bare metal, not covered by keys. You'll want to bring the pieces together with a slight twisting motion.If you're having trouble bringing the pieces together, don't force it. Wipe the joints of the pieces with your cloth and try again.
Take care to hold the pieces gently, by the ends, not by the keys. If you forcefully grab them as you twist, you might damage your instrument.

, If you have a beginner’s flute, you might see that it has little arrow markings where the pieces come together. If you see those, just gently twist the body and the headjoint until the arrows line up. Even if your flute doesn't have markings, it's not difficult to line the pieces up: just gently twist until the hole on the lip plate is centered with the keys on the body., Bring the foot joint and the body together at their joints, again with a slight twisting motion. Gently turn until the first key on the foot joint is slightly to the right of the keys on the body.


Keep the pieces straight as they come together. Attaching them at an angle may damage your flute.
Some flautists find it helpful to gently press the low C and C# keys with their thumb as the attach the footjoint to the body., Once all the pieces of your flute are assembled, play it a bit to make sure it is in tune and put together properly. If something looks, feels, or sounds off, stop and make adjustments as needed.



Use a tuner to help determine if you are hitting notes correctly. There are many convenient electronic tuners you can try., When you are done playing your flute, you should first give it a quick wipe down with your cloth to help keep it clean. Next, take it apart by using the same gentle twisting motions as you did when assembling. Holding each piece by the ends, place them one by one back into the flute’s case., If you are ever unsure if you are assembling your flute correctly, ask your teacher for more guidance. They can give you pointers and watch as you assemble your flute to make sure you are doing it correctly., The joints of a flute are designed to fit snugly for proper tone and intonation. You might think that adding some kind of lubrication will make it easier to assemble the flute, but this can actually cause your flute to play and sound incorrectly. Avoid putting any kind of oil or other lubrication on your flute when assembling it., Always be gentle when assembling your flute. Don’t put your fingers on the moving parts when putting the joints together (unless you are lightly pressing the C keys when putting the footjoint and body together). Use a light touch and gentle twisting motions to fit the joints together, rather than grasping the flute pieces in your hand. Following these guidelines will prevent you from damaging your flute., Keeping your flute clean is important for maintaining the instrument, and it’s convenient to do so when you’re assembling it. Use a polishing cloth (sometimes called a “silver cloth”) available from a music store. Gently wiping the flute and swabbing moisture from the insides when you disassemble it will be sufficient for everyday cleaning."

Clean your flute Your flute should have come with a wood/metal/or plastic rod that looks like an over sized threading needle.",How to Play the Flute," When first starting to play an instrument, you should consider renting to be certain that you enjoy it enough to purchase.









If you're sure you are going to enjoy it, rent-to-own or buying are good options. If you are taking lessons, it's a good idea to consult with your teacher about the right type of flute for you.
Flutes can cost from 100 to 1000+ dollars, but good quality student flutes sell at around the 500-700 dollar mark. Beginners should get an open-hole student flute that has removable plugs. Over time the student should remove plugs. The flute produces a better sound as the vibration hit skin than plastic. Try to research and purchase/rent a reputable brand, as many cheap flutes are poorly made, and hard to play as a result. You can also rent a flute from a a music store that is recommended by your music teacher.
Also some flutes have an extra key at the end. This is called the B foot flute. It is slightly longer. When a flute player becomes more advance, they should think to purchase a step up flute with a b foot.
Expensive, professional flutes are for more experienced flute players. These can range from 1000-10,000+. These tend to be hand made with different precious metals added on. Including gold, platinum and the most common silver. This is for players that want a career in music.
Before you buy, get some advice from other players and/or teachers to help select the right instrument for you.;
, Ask your band director or a music shop employee about it (towards the beginning of the school year, if you are in school). This resource will be very useful as you learn to play and advance to higher levels.








, Before you can play your flute, you will need to learn how to assemble it. You can do so as follows:










The flute has 3 parts. The top part is the headjoint and has the mouthpiece or lip-plate. The part with most of the keys is called the Body at the top of the body (where the headjoint goes into) is called the barrel or tenon, and the end is called the footjoint.
When putting the parts together one must be very careful to not grab the rods and keys of the flute. This can bend the rods and keys and cause the flute to not function properly.
First put the foot joint on by holding the barrel of the flute. Hold the end of the foot joint where you are not grabbing the keys and then do a twist and push motion, and the footjoint should slide right on! Now align the rods of of the footjoint to the middle of the keys of the body

, It is the same thing, grab the barrel and the headjoint. (don't grab the mouthpiece! you can bend it!) Same motion, twist and push. Now align the bore (or the mouth hole) to be aligned with the first key of the body.

!!!This is for beginners!!! The top of the flute is called the cap.Which holds and adjusts the cork. This adjusts the tuning of the flute. Do NOT keep twisting it and DO NOT take off and take cork out! If you feel the flute is out of tune ask a teacher or someone who works at an instrument store.
For those who do not have a lesson teacher and would like to check if the cork is in the correct position take your cleaning rod and flip it around. The bottom of the rod should have a etched line, stick this into the headjoint and look in the hole of the mouthpiece the etched line should be right in the middle.

, At first, producing a sound from your flute can be a little tricky, so you should practice the correct blowing method first, before you attempt to play any specific notes.









BREATHING!! This is one of the most important aspects of playing the flute! Keep your shoulders relaxed and head up, breath from your stomach. By that, just imagine a string pulling from your belly button. Ladies especially young ladies. Your stomach is going to stick out, but this is the correct way to breath.
Deep breaths, not shallow!
Don't just blow, one must have the correct embouchure to play correctly. Think of spitting out a sunflower seed! Try it! Try it again and freeze after you spit the seed out. That is how small the hole of your mouth needs to be while you blow. Now, say the word ""poo"" and freeze your face. This is the general facial position. Now add those 2 together and you now have the right embouchure to play.
Now onto making a sound. Blow across the mouthpiece like blowing across a bottle. The sound is produced by the breaking of your airstream on the edge of the embouchure hole. Half your breath should travel above the hole, and half should travel down through the flute.
Try to keep the corner of your lips firm but not tight!! You will know when they are too tight when you practice and the corners of your mouth is tired and sore. Remember to say ""poo"". This keeps your corner relaxed yet firm!

, Hold the flute with your mouth on the embouchure (lip hole) and the remainder of the instrument pointing to your right hand side, in a horizontal fashion.









Lets start with the right hand. Shake your hand out and let it relax naturally by your side. Bring it up it should be naturally curved. Now make a duck/dinosaur. Notice where you thumb rests naturally on your hand. Some thumb rest between the pointer finger and middle, or under the pointer finger, or under the middle. Just make note of where YOUR thumb lands. Now, open the ""mouth"" and feed it your flute. Remember where you thumb landed naturally? Well place it on your flute and you fingers should be hover above. Now place your pointer finger down on the first key this will be called 1, the next key is where you middle finger is placed, this is 2, you ring finger is the next key, this is 3, and you pinky will rest on this flat half circle key. 9 times out of 10 this pinky will be pressed down and you learn different notes and fingerings.
The left hand is the awkward position. Same as the right hand shake it out and let it drop naturally to the side. Then bring it up and make the duck/dinosaur, then turn the duck/dinosaur to face you. Open the ""mouth"" and feed your hand the flute. Rest your thumb on the circle thumb key (for now, the rectangle key is also a thumb key it is the B natural key, you will learn this as you get a fingering chart) Now skip the top key and place you pointer finger on the second key, this is called 1 as well. Skip the next key and then place you middle finger down that is 2, and you ring finger goes on the key next to your middle finger, that is called 3. Now you pinky will hover over the key sticking out of you flute.
Keep you LH pinky hovering over the key! Get into this habit, don't let hang below or press down. As you learn fingerings you will press this key for certain notes.Bear in mind that this finger placement will feel awkward and unnatural at first. This is completely normal. With practice, it will begin to feel more normal.

, In order to learn how to play specific notes on the flute, you should consult a fingering chart, which will guide you through the finger placement for each note.









Fingering charts make use of pictures and diagrams, which make it easier to visualize the finger placement for each individual note. Most instruction books for the flute will contain a fingering chart, but it is also easy to find these charts online.Practice playing each note until you get it sounding just right. When playing a note on the flute it should not sound like you're just blowing or whistling - it should be a full, steady tone.
Once you have mastered playing each note individually, you can practice playing multiple notes in a row. It doesn't matter if it doesn't sound very musical - the point of the exercise is to learn how to transition smoothly from one note to the next.

, It is essential that you maintain the correct posture while playing the flute, as this will allow you to improve your air capacity and produce more consistent tones.









Stand or sit up as straight as possible, with your chin raised and your eyes looking straight ahead. This opens up your body and allows you to produce clearer, longer notes.
Stand with your two feet planted on the ground and the left foot slightly in front of the right. Your body should be at an angle, this is a more natural position then being body facing straight ahead, your shoulders will not be in a awkward position when read music. You want most of the weight on the right foot/back foot. Try not to stick your hip out too much or have weird angles with your neck, and back.This will only lead to tension and pain, which will interfere with your practice.
Remember to keep your body relaxed and avoid tensing up as you play - this will help you to produce a smoother, richer sound.
If you're using a music stand, make sure you keep it at eye level. If the stand is too low down it will cause you to bend your neck and tuck your chin, which will restrict your airways and cause neck pain., Perfect Practice makes perfect, as the music saying goes. But keep in mind that it's much better to practice for short periods everyday, than to cram all of your practice into a two-hour weekly session. As you get more advance start to increase your practice time.









Make your practice goal-oriented, as this will help you to remain focused. Keep these goals small but concrete. For example, aim to perfect the transition from a B to an A note.
Practicing in infrequent, marathon sessions is inefficient as it overtaxes the body, leaving you feeling stiff and frustrated. You will notice much greater improvement and less stiffness if you practice consistently everyday and increasing your time., You should always stretch after your practice session as it will relieve tension and prevent stiffness after playing, leaving you in better shape for your next practice session. Some good exercises are as follows:









Bend your knees slightly and crouch down with your arms extended behind you, as if skiing. Then swing your arms upwards as if you intended to fly away. Repeat 5-10 times to stretch out the arms and shoulders.
While inhaling, draw your shoulders upwards towards your ears and hold in this position for several seconds. Release your shoulders downwards as you exhale. Repeat several times to release tension and pain in the shoulders and neck.
Stand with your hands down by your sides and shake your arms and hands as if they were made out of rubber. This will help to loosen the joints in the arms and hands.
There are many other stretches you can do to relieve any tension or aches - just do what feels right for you!

, Learning to play the flute takes a while. Some go for months without making a sound, so don't get discouraged if you can't make one when you first get it. Be patient, keep practicing, and get the assistance of a good teacher. Soon you'll be making beautiful music!








, Thread a silky swab through the top or purchase a cleaning flute flag, this is to remove condensation from the inside of your flute. Occasionally polish it with a cloth. Make sure it isn't silver polish. A simple microfiber cloth is all you need.









Never leave your cleaning swab inside you flute, this will cause the moisture to ruin the pads of your flute. You wouldn't leave your wet dirty sock in your sneakers would you? No. The same thing with your cleaning rod.
Take your flute apart the same way you put it together. Grab the tenon and twist and pull the headjoint and the foot joint grab the tenon and the bottom of the footjoint and twist and pull. Put each piece back into the flute case where it belongs!
Now take your cleaning rod/flag and swab the inside of each piece and place back into case.

Learn how to roll your R's.,
Purse your lips in the correct flute embouchure and blow a stream of air.,
Place your mouth on the flute and roll your R's whilst blowing.,
Practice playing flutter tongue on the whole range of the flute.",How to Flutter Tongue on a Flute," Also known as the alveolar trill, this technique is used in the Spanish language for the letter erre and comes more easily to some than others. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, but you cannot flutter tongue if you cannot roll your R's. See How to Roll Your ""R""s for directions.;
, Now comes the hard part. While keeping you lips and cheeks steady, roll your R's and blow a steady stream of air at the same time.

, This should produce the characteristic ""FrrFrrr"" sound of flutter tonguing.

, It is most difficult to use it on the higher notes, and still quite challenging on the lowest.

Pick a note that is generally very easy to play, such as a b-flat or a D. Take a deep breath, and start your note.,
Start a metronome on a moderate tempo in 4/4.,
Keep increasing your beat until it sounds more like a full vibrato.,
Practice until you can do a generally moderate vibrato with an even tone.,
Integrate the vibrato into a piece of music.,
Slowly increase your speed or move to faster/more complicated pieces.",How to Do Vibrato on Flute," With your breath, make a little ""bump"" in the sound by letting more air through for just a moment before going back to your normal air stream. The note should get louder during the bump. Practice this technique––it should be easy. The bump/breath should come from your belly and diaphragm. If you are a singer, you know how important it is to use your whole stomach and lungs to get good air. You may need to tense your core a bit to control your sound.;
, You can also just keep basic time in your head or by tapping your foot. Make a bump in the sound on every beat for several measures. Slowly, increase the speed of your beat/metronome. It will take some time to get it right, but don't worry, with practice it will sound better as you practice more.

, It is extremely important to use your core and air to stay steady and even with your beats. This is why you shouldn't jump to faster tempos before you've gotten the slower ones down-pat. Also keep dynamics in time. Focus on your sound, and make sure the dynamics are generally even on each beat.

, If you're confident, try seeing how long you can go for. If your tone is bad, it doesn't count, so make sure your tone is doing well. After a few exercises, you may choose to practice increasing the tempo even more.

, Don't start with fast pieces; you need to take it slowly to begin with. Start with a sonata or something similar. You will need to rely on your personal opinion on what notes should have vibrato. Long notes usually do, and some people do it with every note, even in fast pieces like marches. Using vibrato in pieces can be much harder, but it is easy to get the hang of once you've done it well.

, By now, you are a vibrato expert! Make sure you aren't hard on yourself if you don't get the hang of it immediately. These skills take time.

"
Make sure the case is in good condition.,
Check the flute pieces for major scratches, keeping in mind that most used flutes will have some tiny, hair-like scratches.

,
Check for dents.,
Examine the pads underneath the keys.,
Check to make sure there are no missing parts or keys.

,
Look on the inside of all the parts and make sure there aren't any hidden dents or marks on the inside.

,
Play a few chromatic scales on the flute.,
Attend a flute convention.,
Decide what metal you want in your flute.,
Consider the many options you have for the keys of your flute.,
Purchase the flute, and any needed accessories.",How to Choose a Flute," Check for dents, scratches, and sticker residue. It should stay firmly closed even after being a bit joggled. Make sure the velvet-like layer has not started to separate from the hard layer of the case. You can always purchase a new, universal case for you flute if the case if damaged, but that will be an added expense.


Look for a metal or plastic tuning rod, which resembles a foot-long needle, inside the case. This can multi-function as a swab with a piece of cloth, and is an essential tool that should come with the flute.;
,, These are far more detrimental than scratches, and even the smallest one can affect your playing.

, They are usually coloured and spongy. They should cover the hole underneath, and should not be excessively dirty or careworn. (Keep in mind that pads can always be replaced though.)

,,, This is to make sure all the notes are working correctly, and that you like the sound the flute produces. One flute will simply not play the same for two people.

, This a great place to play all the different brands of flutes that are available, as well as to get great flute freebies like key paper. Vendors will have flutes on display, just for people to play as they walk around the convention.

, The quality of the metal will affect the tone a lot. Most beginning flutes are nickel or silver plated nickel. Pure silver (sterling silver) is the next quality up. If you are purchasing an intermediate flute, a pure silver head joint or full flute is ideal. Next, there is the option of rose gold, which can run about the cost of a car, and there are even platinum or titanium flutes!


The most important part of the flute is the head joint, so if you cannot afford the body and foot joint in a pricier metal, buy just the head joint.
Watch out for gold plated lip plates. They don't affect tone at all and are just for looks.However a better quality riser, the short ""chimney"" that attaches the lip plate to the head joint, does improve tone.

, These things often take experience to gain a preference.



Open hole keys: These are recommended for advanced or intermediate players, and not beginners. Openings in the keys allow the air to go through when uncovered, and this leads to a fuller, more resonant tone. The open holes also create less air resistance, so it is easier to play notes. It will take some adjustment to switch from closed holes because you will have to cover the holes and perfectly with your fingers for the note to sound correctly. Start out with plugs in the keys that are hardest to reach, so you can play normally, and work at playing without the plugs while you practice.

Inline G key: This is a matter of personal preference and won't affect the tone. An inline G key just means that one key will be a bit harder to reach (see the image to the right). If you have small hands or are used to playing with an offset G key, it is fine to stick with that. The main reason an inline G key is preferred is for the pleasing look of the keys.

B foot: You can buy a foot joint with a few extra keys that enables you to play one chromatic step lower than usual (a B). This is a good idea for intermediate or above players because they will probably come across the note their flute literature.

Gizmo key: This key will usually be included in a B foot and makes it easier to play high C or C# (5+ ledger lines).

Split E Mechanism: A split E mechanism divides the action of the upper and lower G keys. Normally the G keys close together; in a split E mechanism, that is still true, but the lower G can close when the third octave E natural is played. This provides ideal tone hole venting for the high E and can improve tuning and tone for a flutist., You will probably want a silver-polishing cloth (or other cloth specific to your metal) to remove fingermarks. A swab or flute snake is fun to have, but you can also use a strip of an old t-shirt and the tuning rod to clean out spit. Pad paper is essential to fix ""sticky keys."" (They make awful noises.) You can also buy thumb rests for the bottom of the flute to make it more comfortable. Try jazzing up your flute case with fun stickers or key chains. One essential item is to add a name tag to your flute case with contact information in case it gets lost. Enjoy your new flute!

Learn to play the flute.,

Choose a piccolo according to where you will be using it and your level of proficiency.,Gather the needed accessories from the Things You'll Need section below.,
Consider paying for a flute teacher who also plays piccolo to give you private lessons.,

Learn the range of a piccolo.,Become familiar with playing your major, minor, and chromatic scales.,
Try practicing with an electric tuner in front of you.,
Tune before you play.,
Practice often.,
Clean your piccolo thoroughly after playing.",How to Play the Piccolo," The piccolo is very similar and you should learn how to play flute first. If you play in a band or orchestra, it's probable that you won't be playing piccolo all the time, depending on the types of pieces the ensemble plays, so having the versatility to be able to play the flute as well is important.
, Plastic or silver plated metal piccolos are less expensive than wood or silver piccolos. Piccolos made of composite plastic are durable enough for marching and produce a fair quality sound. Wooden piccolos offer a more mellow timbre than metal ones. A popular compromise combines a metal head joint with a body made from wood. Two materials combined may lead to tuning inconsistencies however, as they will react differently to changing temperatures.

Keep in mind there are different keys the piccolo is tuned in. C is most common, but many older piccolos are in Db. It is recommended you choose a C piccolo, as you can just play the flute part. Db parts aren't common, but you can find them in older pieces.

,, This resource will be very important as you learn to play., Flute fingerings will produce the same notes on a piccolo, only an octave higher. Music is written one octave below concert pitch. It may take time to become accustomed to the notes you play and the ones on the page.,, See you how long you can hold a note steady and try to be consistently in tune. Also see what the tendencies of certain notes are on your piccolo- flat? sharp? in tune?, Tune to an A. If the tuner says you are sharp (moves to the right), pull out the head joint. If you are flat (tuner will move to the left), push in the head joint. The piccolo is a small and fickle instrument, so be prepared to make constant small adjustments! Try tuning to the low and high A. Piccolos cannot tune as effectively to concert F or B flat, which is often played for tuning in large ensembles., Others may find the piercing sound of a learner on a piccolo aggravating, so try practicing in a closed room. Just make sure wherever you practice is large and has decent acoustics., Use a swab or string a cloth through your tuning rod and then through your piccolo to remove spit. Occasionally polish it with a cloth."

Sit up straight.,
Hold your flute up.,
Balance the flute.,
Breathe correctly.,
Support the air stream.",How to Improve Your Tone on the Flute1," In fact, it's easiest to play with a good tone while standing. Make sure your back is straight up and down when you are sitting, and don't slouch! Turn your body at a slight angle so that you don't have to reposition your neck to see the music stand clearly.
, You've probably been told this at least a thousand times, but it can affect your tone if you hold the flute too low. You should hold it about 20° below parallel. When you hold it any lower you collapse your stomach area and cannot take a proper breath or support the tone. If you hold it any higher you will create tension in your right arm., This is related, but not the same thing as correct posture. There are three points of balance when holding up a flute: the chin, left thumb, and the right thumb.

The lip plate should rest in the hollow between your lip and chin, and you should feel a gentle pressure on the lower gums. Your flute should rest just above the lowest knuckle of your left pointer finger, above where the finger meets the hand. The flute should rest on the tip of the right thumb, underneath or slightly behind the flute, between the F and E keys. Your right pinkie finger should then land naturally on the E flat key.Once in this position, it should feel very natural, and the flute should ""float"", allowing you to produce a resonant sound.

, Take a deep breath starting with your belly, not your chest, before playing. You should see your belly physically expand. Your back should expand too toward the end of a deep breath. If your chest is the first thing to expand, or your shoulders rise upward when you breath, you are not getting as much air as you could. Your lips should also make a triangular gap when blowing.

One way to practice this is to bend forward at the waist, making a 90 degree angle between your legs and torso. Then take a deep breath starting from your belly, feeling your entire belly and back expand before your chest does.

, Think about activating your core and belly muscles to physically ""support"" the air and produce a strong, steady stream. This will also help you play in tune, which always makes for a better tone and is extremely important when playing with others.


Listen to your tone while blowing into the flute, too. Think about sounding resonant and full. Imagine that you are vibrating the whole length of your flute with your breath.
Shape your lips. Making the hole in your lips smaller can produce a better tone. The air stream is more direct and you do not use as much air. On the other hand, make sure not to make the hole too small, or you can cut off the airflow and get an airy or forced sound.

"
"
Experiment.,
Record yourself.,
Practice long tones.,
Know that better tones on certain notes will come with time and familiarity.,
Listen to recordings of professional flutists.",How to Improve Your Tone on the Flute2," You won't find your ideal tone until you know what all the options are! Furthermore, the meaning of a ""good"" flute tone depends on the music you're playing, and skilled musicians know how to vary their tone color (rich, bright, mellow, sweet, intense, haunting, etc.) to suit the mood they want to create. To practice this, pick a note you can play comfortably, hold it, and explore the following movements. As you play, notice how the sound changes, whether it seems more or less pleasing, and what types of musical moods it might evoke. Over time you can learn to pick the tone color you want and immediately find the position of your lips, jaw and body to produce it.

Move the end of your flute higher and lower. This changes the angle of the air across the embouchure hole. Many flutists let their right arm drop too far for optimal tone and this exercise will show you if you're one of them.
Move the end of your flute forward and backward. This also changes the angle of the air stream. Listen for the place where it sounds the most focused.
Tilt your head left, right, forward and back. Feel what's most comfortable and sounds clearest.
Roll the mouthpiece in and out. This changes how much air enters the flute and also affects pitch (whether you're flat, sharp, or just right).
Direct your airstream higher or lower by moving your jaw forward and back. This affect can be similar to rolling the mouthpiece in or out.
Make the muscles in your lips, cheeks and jaw more relaxed and less relaxed.

, You may be surprised. The acoustics of our own bodies and the space around them mean that your tone will sound different when heard by you as you play, someone standing a few feet away, and someone sitting in the back of a large concert hall. There are professional flutists with very bold tones that can border on abrasive if you're standing next to them, but they carry beautifully during a solo in a large hall.

Conversely, a delicate, sweet tone that sounds lovely to the player's own ears may seem weak and uninteresting from across the room. It can be very helpful to record yourself from various distances to understand how you'll sound to others. Of course, unless you have high quality recording equipment this doesn't work perfectly, but even a video on your smartphone is better than nothing.

, As many music teachers like to say, ""Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect."" Unless you spend a lot of time trying to play with good tone, you won't reliably develop it. One way to do this is to spend part of every practice session on long tones. This is often done as part of your warm-up. Moyse's ""de la Sonorité"" book is a classic resource for this, but you can also find many online resources describing long tone practice techniques.

Use vibrato on longer notes. Vibrato is a technique in which the player pitch bends very fast. Act like you are whispering ""ha, ha, ha"" and try to play a note.It might sound unnatural at first, so practice until it is natural and even. Vibrato is a good technique that will create interest on longer notes and mask tuning inconsistencies as well. The speed of the vibrato depends upon the effect a flutist is trying to achieve; a faster vibrato often portrays a more intense feeling, while a slower vibrato is more soothing.

, As you become more familiar with lower and higher notes on the flute, your tone will improve on them as well. Don't just assume that time will solve everything however. It takes practice too!, They all play with reasonably good tone or they would not have made it as professionals, but you may also notice you like some better than others. Think about what characterizes the tones you like the best, and experiment with trying to imitate them as you play."

Have your flute serviced regularly.,
Get a better flute.,
Consider metal quality when picking a new flute.,
Choose a flute with well-crafted pieces.",How to Improve Your Tone on the Flute3," A flute that works better has a better tone. Period. If your tuning cork is messed up, a key is leaking, the rods are misaligned, or your flute is ailing in any other way, that will negatively affect your tone. To some extent, you can fix things yourself--sticky keys or loose screws--but for most things have your flute checked at a music store., The quality of the metal (whether nickel, silver,gold, or even platinum) and the craftsmanship that went into making a flute drastically affect its tone. They say a master flutist can make even the lowest quality flute sound great, but for the rest of us, instrument quality makes a difference. If you have a beginner's flute and want to play seriously, consider buying a new one. Professional and intermediate flutes are crafted more precisely, and it is easier to get a good tone on many notes., Most beginning flutes are nickel or silver plated nickel. Pure silver (sterling silver) is the next quality up. If you are purchasing an intermediate flute, first go for an all silver headjoint and silver plated body and keys. Then all silver headjoint and body with plated keys, then all silver flute. You can also customize your flute with different gold contents, gold plated on silver, platinum, and more!

Platinum makes your flute sound darker and more powerful, and gold makes your flute have a warmer and luscious tone.
The most important part of the flute is the head joint, so if you cannot afford the body and foot joint, make sure to update the head joint's metal quality at the least.
Some companies sell head joints with ""wings"" on the lip plate. The ""wings"" help direct the air in the flute and minimize the amount of air that escapes. It helps you have a clearer tone and sound less airy.
Watch out for gold plated lip plates. They don't affect tone at all and are just for looks.However a better quality riser, the short ""chimney"" that attaches the lip plate to the head joint, does improve tone.

, There are many components that allow a flute to work, but in particular, look for flutes with open key holes, an in-line G key, a B foot, a gizmo key, and a split E mechanism.





 Open hole on top, close hole or plateau keys on bottom

Open hole keys: These allow the air to go through when uncovered, and this leads to a fuller, more resonant tone. The open holes also create less air resistance, so it is easier to play notes. This is highly recommended, but it will take some adjustment once you switch because you will have to cover the holes completely with your fingers. Start out with plugs in the keys that are hardest to reach, so you can play normally, and work at playing without the plugs while you practice.




 Inline on top, offset on bottom

In line G key: This is a matter of personal preference and won't really affect the tone. An in line G key just means that one key will be a bit harder to reach (see the image to the right). If you have small hands or are used to playing with an offset G key, it is fine to stick with that. The main reason an in line G key is preferred is for the pleasing look of the keys.




 B foot on top, C foot on bottom

B foot: You can purchase a foot joint with a few extra keys that enables you to play one chromatic step lower than usual (a B). This is a good idea because you will probably come across the note in advanced flute literature. A flute with a B foot can also produce fuller tones than the same one with a C foot.




 The gizmo key is the long, little one, closest to the viewer.

Gizmo key: This key will almost always be included in a B foot and makes it easier to play high C or C# (5+ ledger lines).A split E mechanism indicated by the red arrow

Split E Mechanism: A split E mechanism divides the action of the upper and lower G keys. Normally the G keys close together; in a split E mechanism, that is still true, but the lower G can close when the third octave E natural is played. This provides ideal tone hole venting for the high E and can improve tuning and tone for a flutist."

Play B: B is the first note most people learn on the recorder, as it is one of the easiest to play. To play a B note, use your left thumb to cover the hole on the back of the recorder and use your left index finger to cover the first or top hole on the front of the recorder. Make sure to completely cover both holes with your fingers.



 



Play A: To play A, use your left thumb to cover the hole on the back of the recorder, your left index finger to cover the first hole on the front of the recorder and your left middle finger to cover the second hole. It's basically the same as B, just with one extra finger.

Note: The dashes ( - ) are used to indicate that the note should be held for an extra count.

, Now that you know which notes to play, all that's left to do is practice!


Practice the song slowly at first - it's more important to get the notes right than it is to play the song quickly. Speed will come with time.
Once you've got the hang of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", you can work on some other easy songs, like ""Hot Cross Buns"" or ""Gently Sleep"".

, Place the recorder between your lips and balance it lightly between your thumbs and fingers.


Your left hand should be at the end nearest the mouthpiece and your right hand should be at the other end.
Don't bite down on the mouthpiece or allow it to touch your teeth.

, How strongly or softly you blow into the recorder will affect the type of sound your produce.


If you blow too hard, the recorder will produce an unpleasant, high-pitched sound, so you should try to avoid this.
Instead, try to blow softly - as if you were blowing bubbles. This will produce a more musical sound.
Breathe from your diaphragm to produce a steady, even stream of air. This will help you to hold your notes for longer. Sitting up straight, with your shoulders back will help you to maintain good posture while you play.

, When you play a note on the recorder, you should imagine saying the word ""doot"" or ""dud"" as you blow.


This causes your tongue to move to the roof of your mouth. This technique is known as ""tonguing"" and provides a clear start and finish to each note.
Be careful not to actually say the words as you play, you should only use them as a guideline to help you learn the tonguing technique., Taking good care of your recorder will keep it in tip-top playing condition.


Wash your recorder with a little warm soapy water, and scrub the mouthpiece with an old toothbrush. Leave the recorder to dry thoroughly before playing again.
Keep your recorder in a case when you're not playing, to protect it from chipping or other damage.
Don't leave it somewhere it'll be exposed to very warm or very cold temperatures, like in a warm car or beside the radiator.

Practice.",How to Play Hot Cross Buns on the Recorder," This is the “Golden Rule” for holding a recorder, even if you’re right-handed. On the front of the recorder, the top three holes are designated for three fingers from your left hand: the finger above your middle finger (pointer), your middle finger, and the finger below your middle finger (ring).
The bottom four holes are for the four fingers of your right hand (the right thumb is not involved).
The hole in the back is where your left thumb goes. ;
, Each of your fingers is assigned a specific hole on the recorder.


For ""Hot Cross Buns"", you’ll only be using the first three holes and the thumb hole.
Your pointer finger will always be covering the first hole.
Your thumb will always be covering the back.
Your middle finger is assigned to the second hole.
Your ring finger is assigned to the third.

, Place your lips on the beak (the very tip of the mouthpiece) and make sure you don’t have it so far in your mouth that your teeth are touching it.


Blow gently into the recorder, using your tongue to help start and end the note.
Your tongue should move the same way it does when you say “do.” , If you don’t know how to read music, no big deal! The song only uses three simple notes: B, A, and G, so it’s easy to learn without having to teach yourself to read music.


""Hot Cross Buns"" is divided into four measures (also called bars), which are sections that help you keep track of where you are in the song.
The first, second, and fourth measures are all identical and play as B A G. The third measure looks like GGGG AAAA. , With your pointer finger covering the first hole and your thumb covering the back, simply blow once into the recorder. This is the B note, which is the first note of the song.

, With your pointer finger on the first hole and your thumb on the back, cover the second hole with your middle finger. With these three holes covered, blow once into the recorder. This is the second note of the song.

, With the three holes still covered, go ahead and cover the third hole with your ring finger. With these four holes covered, blow into the recorder once. This is the third note of the song.

, The first and second measures are identical, so play B A G, rest, B A G, moving your fingers according to the note you’re on.

, This looks like GGGG AAAA. Set your fingers up for the G note and then blow four times quickly into the recorder. Then switch to the A note and blow four times quickly. This is the third measure.

, Again, the fourth measure is the same as the first and second measures, so play the B note once, then the A note once, then the G note once. You’ve now played the fourth measure and completed the song.

, Practicing helps you memorize proper finger placement for the notes, which will ensure accuracy and also help you move more quickly.

Find an instructor in your area.,
Purchase a quality practice chanter.,
Listen to lots of pipe music to discover what you like, and what style you would like to learn.,
Begin actually learning the instrument.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Decide if you want to continue learning this instrument.,
Begin looking into purchasing your own set of pipes!,
Stop if you are getting frustrated.",How to Learn to Play the Great Highland Bagpipe," Although this isn't mandatory, it will make the learning process much shorter, as well as improve your piping much quicker than without an instructor. Spend time talking to other pipers and finding out where they learned. You might be surprised how many pipers are in your area. Ask around at music stores, or try an online forum like Bob Dunsire's website. Sometimes it will be either impossible to find a local teacher, or to know if that teacher is a quality instructor. You can supplement your knowledge and inform yourself by using paid internet services such as Jori Chisolm's, John Cairn's, or Robert Pinkman's. Other free websites will help you know if what you are being told is accurate and to form an opinion. These include Teach Yourself Bagpipes and Scottish Piper. It is NOT advised to attempt to learn all by yourself, or from the internet, unless those methods are a supplement to learning from an instructor. Teachers can be found via The Bagpipe Teachers list (and the free sites also contain lists to teachers).;
, The Great Highland Bagpipe is a complex instrument, and you don't learn on a set of bagpipes. You begin learning on a practice chanter. Poor quality chanters (Pakistani made mostly) are very inexpensive, but sound awful, and are very frustrating for a beginner to learn on. When you look for a practice chanter, you will be faced with many choices including, but not limited to long vs. short, regular holes vs. countersunk holes, wood or plastic. Many of these choices are effectively cosmetic differences, however beginners generally have an easier time on a long chanter with countersunk holes. Gibson Bagpipes makes a fine long chanter that many a would be piper have learned on. Ask your instructor for advice.

, There are many pipe bands around the world, but there are also ceilidh bands that feature a single piper with other instruments. Try listening to a few of these bands to get a feel for what different styles sound like: Pipe bands - Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, Alberta Caledonia Pipe Band, Shotts & Dykehead, Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band, Boghall & Bathgate, etc. Ceilidh Bands - Wicked Tinkers, Peatbog Fairies, Seven Nations, Rogues of Scotland (Later Scottish Rogues, and then something else after that, but the writer has forgotten what.), etc. Solo Piping, including Piobaireachd - the Classical music of the bagpipe - Martyn Bennett, Gordon Duncan, Jack Lee, Stuart Liddell, Richard Kean etc. Many punk rock bands also incorporate bagpipes into their music. This is known as Celtic punk, and the playing style is usually fast and upbeat. Examples of bands who use bagpipes are The Real McKenzies, Dropkick Murphys and Flatfoot 56. If you want to play this style, be prepared to practice a lot as it is very challenging.

, Start with learning the scales. Scales might not be fun, but on a bagpipe, it is necessary to learn to be able to play the scales without ""catching"" or ""crossing"" noises before moving on. After Scales one learns grace notes, and finally the other embellishments. These can be very complex movements that require quite a lot of skill and timing in order to perform properly.

, Don't give up. When you fail to make a clear D throw for the three thousandth time, don't throw your practice chanter across the room in frustration. Just set it down to give your fingers and head a rest, and come back when you feel refreshed and ready to try again. The Great Highland Bagpipe is an extraordinarily difficult instrument to master. Be patient.

, After you have learned enough to be able to play all the common embellishments well on a practice chanter, you will want to decide if you are ready to actually move into playing the pipes for real. It is both costly and time consuming.

, Ask around, and more importantly - listen to other pipers play. If you hear a set of pipes that sounds particularly good, ask the player what make his pipes are. Most pipers are quite open to discussing their set up.

, Find people to play with, other beginners to practice with, and enjoy yourself!

Purchase gouged cane from your music store.,
Place the gouged cane in warm water and let it soak for 30 minutes.,
Use a wedging knife and draw it down through the cane on both sides, following the contour of the shaping tool.,Slightly narrow the width of each end of the cane.,Shape the cane by folding into the shaper and clamping it securely.,
Allow the reed to dry in the shaper.,
Remove reed from the shaper tool.,Pass an arm's length of nylon string (attached to the spool) through beeswax by pulling it across a piece of the solid wax 3-5 times,
Tie the cane to the staple with the nylon string.,
Scrape the reed.,

""Crow"" the reed.",How to Make Oboe Reeds,"

Cane can be purchased 1 of 2 ways; either gouged or shaped and tubed. For the purpose of this article, we will start with gouged cane and shape it.;
,

This allows the cane to become more pliable for shaping.

,

This allows the cane to lay flush when inserted in the shaping tool.

,,,

This usually takes a day or 2 and will allow the reed to hold its proper form.

,

Your original long piece of cane will now be doubled over on itself, with one end a little bit narrower than the folded end. The reed will look like a pipe or tube that has been split in half, but joined and flat at one end and open and rounded at the other.

,,

The length of the staple is usually 1 7/8 inches (47 mm). Leave 3/4 of an inch (18 mm) of cane exposed above the staple tool and wrap the rest of the reed to the staple. This results in a 3-inch (75mm) assembly.
Wrap nylon around the reed at the end of the staple as tight as possible. The end product must be airtight. You will be winding the nylon in successive rows, much like a coil of string or wire, with no spaces between the coils.

,

Scraping is probably the most important part of making your double reed. The easiest way to scrape is to place the reed on a mandrel for easy handling.
Scrape the tip in an upward motion (toward the folded tip). Scrape the reed several times on each side from one corner to the other. Work the reed in this manner until you feel your reed is scraped to your needs. This might take some trial and error.
Make sure to keep the reed moist for easier scraping. Dip it in a cup of water now and then for a few seconds.

,

Leave the plaque in place to support the reed as you continue on to the rest of the scraping process.

,,

The windows are on either side of the spine of the reed. Each window will extend to the edge, or rail, of the reed. Leave wood on the spine.

,

Crowing the reed is a process to check the basic sound of the reed without placing it in the instrument. Place the reed in your mouth, with your lips on the coiled thread, and blow. The sound you hear should be much like that of a crow.

,Make sure if you need to carry your bassoon with you while moving, put the bocal in the bell of your instrument.",How to Care for a Bassoon," The swabs that come with an instrument are not the best solution; a perfect swab for the long and butt joints is a pull-through designed for a bass clarinet. Similarly, there is a somewhat smaller pull-through for the wing joint. Pull-throughs work better and have less lint than the swabs originally provided by most manufacturers.;
, A very small pull-through can also be used here. A flexible brush designed for French horns also works very well.

Choose a ukulele.,
Know the parts of the ukulele.,
Tune your ukulele.,
Get the correct posture.",How to Play the Ukulele1," There are several different sizes and corresponding sounds of ukuleles, and it is important to select the best option for you. As a beginner you will most likely want to choose a cheaper option rather than investing in an expensive ukulele, but this may not be the case. There are four different styles of ukuleles.


A soprano ukulele is the most common style. It is recognized by its small size and classic “uke” sound. This is the cheapest style of ukulele, and is most often chosen by beginners. It is on average 21” long, and has anywhere from 12-14 frets.






The alto ukulele (or concert ukulele), is the next size up from a soprano. It measures 23” long and has 15-20 frets. Because of its slightly bigger size, people with large hands find it easier to play than a soprano ukulele. It also has a slightly fuller sound than a soprano.






The next step up from an alto ukulele is the tenor ukulele. The tenor ukulele is 26” long and has 15+ frets. It has an even richer sound than the concert ukulele, and has the ability to reach more notes because of its extended fretboard.






The largest ukulele is the baritone ukulele, which is 30” or more and has 19+ frets. It is tuned the same way as the four lowest strings on a guitar, which makes the two instruments very similar. Because of its size, it loses the classic ukulele sound, but is a good option if you want really full, rich music.Some ukuleles are a different shape, namely flukes, pineapples or fleas. A fluke is shaped like a triangle, a pineapple is shaped like, well a pineapple (oval shape), and a flea is shaped like a pineapple ukulele with a flat bottom. The one pictured in the illustration is a pineapple.





;
, The ukulele has an anatomy of parts slightly different than a guitar or other stringed instrument. Before you begin playing it, make sure you understand the basic layout of the instrument.


The body of the uke is the hollow wooden part that makes up the majority of the instrument. It has a small hole under the strings that you strum above.






The neck of the uke is the long wooden piece that the strings sit above. The neck refers to the slightly rounded bottom part, while the flat top part of the neck is called the fingerboard or fretboard.






The frets are sections of the fingerboard divided by metal fret dividers. Each fret divides the strings into different notes.






The head of the ukulele is the topmost part of the uke where the tuners are located.






There are four strings on a ukulele, although depending on the type of uke you buy they may be different. The lowest or thickest string is known as the 1st string, moving upwards to the highest or thinnest string which is the 4th string., Before you start playing, it is imperative that you tune your instrument. This will give the strings the correct sound, and lessen the discouragement you would have thinking you were playing poorly when your uke was simply out of tune. To tune the uke, you twist the tuner knobs at the top of the head to tighten and loosen the strings.


Over time, the tension in the string reduces - they get looser - which puts them out of tune. That means you will have to tighten the strings more often than you will have to loosen them.






If you are facing the uke, the top left tuner is ‘C,’ the bottom left tuner is ‘G,’ the top right tuner is ‘E,’ and the bottom right tuner controls ‘A’. Adjusting these will change the corresponding string’s sound.






Use an electric tuner or an online tuner to hear the sound each string should make when plucked. Then, alter the sound of yours until it matches.






If you have a piano or keyboard available, you can play the key that corresponds to the string you are tuning and match those sounds., If you don’t hold your ukulele the right way when you are playing it, you won’t sound as good, you will be uncomfortable, and you run the risk of injuring your wrists over time. Make sure that you are always in the proper position with good posture before beginning to play your ukulele.


Regardless of whether you are sitting or standing, you will hold your ukulele in the same fashion.
The ukulele should be slightly pushed between your right forearm and your body, and simultaneously resting in the crook of your elbow. If you are holding it correctly, you can remove either of your hands without the uke shifting position. This also means that the uke is held relatively high on your body, near your waist or chest.
The neck of the uke should be resting on the thumb and web of your left hand, allowing you to reach around with your other four fingers to touch all the strings.
When you strum with your right hand, use the back of your nails going down the strings and the fleshy part of your fingertips coming back up.
Strum a little higher on the body of the uke than the hollow hole in the center. Although that is the correct position to play the strings on a guitar, for a uke it is the proper position to play nearer to the neck.
Keep you back and shoulders straight so that you aren’t hunched over the ukulele. This will improve your appearance when playing and reduce the amount of pain and tension in your back."

Learn some basic chords.,
Learn basic major chords.,
Learn the basic minor chords.",How to Play the Ukulele2," Chords are when you play more than one note at once, creating a harmonic sound. To play a chord, you use your left hand to hold down strings at different frets simultaneously. Learning to play chords is easy; you will be supplied with the string number, fret number, and the specific finger required to recreate each sound.

, Major chords are formed by three or notes played simultaneously, with the distance between the first and second notes being two whole steps apart. Major chords are associated with cheery or happy music.To play a C Major chord, place your ring finger on the 4th string on the third fret.






To play an F Major chord, put your index finger on the 2nd string of the first fret, and your ring finger on the first string of the second fret.
To play a G Major chord, place your index finger on the 3rd string of the second fret, your middle finger on the 4th string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 2nd string of the third fret.
To play an A Major chord, put your index finger on the 3rd string of the first fret, and your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret.
To play a D Major chord, place your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, your ring finger on the 2nd string of the second fret, and your pinky finger on the 3rd string of the second fret.
To play an E Major chord, put your index finger on the 4th string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your pinky finger on the 3rd string of the fourth fret.

, Minor chords are three or more concurrently played notes, with the distance from the first and second notes being three half-steps. Minor chords are considered sad or gloomy sounding compared to major chords.


To play an A Minor chord, place your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret.
To play an E Minor chord, put your index finger on the 4th string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 3rd string of the fourth fret.
To play a D Minor chord, place your index finger on the 2nd string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 3rd string of the second fret.
To play an F# or Gb Minor chord, put your index finger on the 3rd string of the first fret, your middle finger on the 1st string of the second fret, and your ring finger on the 2nd string of the second fret.
To play a B Minor chord, bar the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings with your index finger by holding them all down simultaneously on the second fret, and hold the 1st string down on the fourth fret with your ring finger."

Practice your timing.,
Learn whole songs.,
Practice daily.",How to Play the Ukulele3," Once you’ve learned some basic notes and chords, putting them together may seem simple but requires a little timing. In order for your music to sound cohesive and melodic, it is important that you have good rhythm.


Keeping a rhythm to your strumming pattern will be difficult at first while you learn how to adjust your left hand quickly between notes and chords. As you get better, try to avoid taking breaks between finger adjustments to improve your timing.
Try counting in fours while you are playing to help keep a beat while you strum.
If you have a difficult time strumming in time, try using a metronome. This is a small electronic gadget that sounds off little clicks at a steady rate, allowing you to pace your strumming to match. You can adjust the speed that it plays to meet your comfort level.
Don’t try to play super fast at first, as you will be likely to make more mistakes. Start out with a slow, steady rhythm and then work your way towards a more fast-pace beat.

, Once you have mastered all the basic major and minor chords, you can play nearly any beginner’s song. Using your now rhythmic strumming and fingering you will be able to play recognizable songs in no time.


Many ukulele music books provide popular tunes that are easy for beginners to learn. Pick one up at a local music supply store and start playing!
If you want to learn some of your favorite songs, search online for the song’s uke tabs. Tabs are like the music for the ukulele, telling you the differing chords and fingering positions that are required.

, The most important thing you can do to improve your overall playing ability is to practice on a regular basis. You don’t have to have an inborn talent for music to become a fantastic uke player, but rather just need perseverance and diligence. Putting at least 20-30 minutes of practice a day will help you to become the master instrumentalist you always wanted to be!

",How to Buy a Ukulele," Are you just a casual hobbyist or a fanatic? For example, you should reconsider buying a ukulele for $1000 if you're just playing the ukulele as a casual hobby, or if you have zero musical background. Remember, you could just upgrade to a higher quality ukulele (aka more expensive) once you've mastered the basics.;
, There are four main types of ukuleles: soprano, concert (or alto), tenor, and baritone.



Soprano is the original, most common and smallest type of ukuleles, perfect for traveling. They have the jangly, light sound commonly associated with ukuleles. People with larger hands or fingers might have difficulties playing the soprano ukulele, as the frets are closer together. The strings also have less tension, so you might find it easy to accidentally bend a string out of tune.

Despite that, this type of ukulele is the best for the beginner uke player, as it's the cheapest compared to other types, and you can carry it anywhere. There are certain sopranos that come with longer neck, which allows you to reach higher notes, but those are not so common.



Concert (or alto) ukuleles are a bit bigger than the soprano, so they have a deeper and a fuller sound than the soprano ones. As all the next uke sizes, it has a longer neck, and more frets as a result. This type of ukulele is easier to play for people with larger hands.
The Tenor ukulele is a little bigger than the concert, and the overall sound and tone is even fuller than its smaller siblings. It's great for performers.

Baritone ukuleles are the biggest of the ukes. They have the deepest sound, compared to the others, and while you can still strum a baritone ukulele like any other ukulele, you’re going to really lose that bright crisp sound that you’d get with soprano. It sounds more like a guitar. Great for blues players and anyone who prefers that deeper and fuller sound.

, Each wood has its special characteristics that affect the sound.


Mahogany - one of the most common woods in ukulele making, it has a reasonable grain finish providing good looks, but provides a good balance between the bright treble sounds the ukulele is famous for, whilst beefing up the bass. Also projects sound well and with good volume. Often used for necks only.
Koa - the best-known hardwood of the Hawaiian Islands. Acacia koa is a native forest tree, unique to Hawaii, and held in reverence. The wood is beautiful to look at with amazing grains (particularly the curly variety), very sweet sounding and warm. Loud, rich in sound, and used in the finest (and most expensive) ukuleles.
Cedar - a common, reddish soft wood often used in acoustic guitars, has a plain finish and provides a very warm sound, evenly distributed amongst the strings.
Spruce - very common, pale yellow wood used in guitar manufacture. Now seen on many cheaper ukuleles on the top only (usually with rosewood or mahogany backs and sides). It is a tough wood that makes for excellent strong soundboards and the Sitka variety is characterized by a very bright and rich tone, with less of the bass rounding that Mahogany provides.They are also very loud woods. Engelmann spruce is a slightly more mellow version which is often used in classical instruments.
Maple - good density and resistant, very treble, comes in many types. A hard, resilient wood that is often chosen for its dramatic looks, particularly flamed or spalted woods that are stunning to look at. It provides a very bright tone on the ukulele.
Mango - beautiful looking, orange wood with beautiful grain, that is used increasingly as a more sustainable wood choice (as Mango is a fruit tree, the wood is harvested after the tree is no longer efficiently producing fruit, and is then replanted). Mango provides a warm yet bright tone, similar to walnut.

, Ask for brand recommendations, and learn from them, whether they're experienced professionals or casual players. Find out which brands has the best sounding ukuleles, yet won't drill a hole in your wallet.


If you can't find a group near your area, you can find plenty of articles and forum discussions on the web.

, The store should have a variety choices of brands, types, and pricing of the ukulele. Ask your ukulele playing friends if they know of a good store near you.

, Hear the difference between the uke sizes. Once you figured the desirable size, pick a couple of instruments of different brands and examine them. Is it too shrill for your preference? Are the frets too close together? Look at the distance between the strings and the neck. It shouldn't be too big or too small. This distance affects the amount of pressure you'll have to apply when fretting chords.

, Try Am, C, G, D, F. Choosing may be difficult, but your heart will tell you which one is right for you. Once you feel that the sound of the uke resonates with your inner sense of beauty, you found your instrument!

Make sure the wig is the right size for your head.,
Choose a wig cap.,
Put on the wig cap.,
Pull the wig cap on.,
Secure the wig cap.,
Slide the wig over your head.,
Place the wig's scalp line against your forehead.,
Pull the wig down until it covers the back of your wig cap.,
Use bobby pins to secure your wig.,
Test how well you've applied the wig.,
Style the wig.",How to Wear a Cosplay Wig," You may have already figured out if the wig is the right size for your head, and if that’s the case, you can skip to the next step. If not, quickly measure your head with measuring tape. If your head is between 21 to 22 inches (51 to 55 cm), then you should be able to fit into most cosplay wigs. If your head is any larger, it’s a good idea to try on the wig to make sure it fits comfortably., There are usually two types of wig caps. One kind of wig cap is made of a fishnet-like material. The other type is similar to pantyhose. The fishnet wig cap is often tighter and hair can come out of the holes. The pantyhose wig cap is usually preferred because it’s not as tight and covers all of your hair., If it's long enough, twist your hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck. Then, flip that ponytail so that it lies up against your head, and the tail points toward or across your forehead. If your hair is short, pin it down with hair pins so that it fits easily into the wig cap.It’s also an option to put your hair into pin curls if it is long.
If your hair is very thick or curly, it will make it easier to pull your hair back if you wet it a little bit.

, Start from the back of your head if you have a lot of hair in a ponytail. Stuff as much of your hair as possible down toward the back of your neck, making sure it's still contained by the wig cap. If you have short hair or are bald, simply pull the wig cap on. Check to make sure all or most of your hair has been hidden by the cap., Use snap clips to secure the wig cap to your hair. You will need about 10 snap clips in total. Use 6 snap clips spaced evenly around the front of your head. Snap in 4 clips towards the back of your head. You can use more or less clips if necessary.Make sure the top of the clip is over the cap and the bottom of the wig is under the hair and cap.

, Hold the wig with both hands. The backs of your hands should be facing each other, and the fingers should be inside the wig with thumbs outside of the wig. Slowly begin to slide the wig over the cap., It should be placed just above your eyebrows. Tilt your head forward as you slowly stretch the back and sides of the wig down over your wig cap, sliding your fingers out from underneath the edges as you pull them down.

, The wig will stretch to accommodate any extra hair that you've stuffed into the back of your wig cap. Tug the back of the wig down until the front of it sits just below your natural hairline. If the wig you're wearing has bangs, you can let it sit a little higher—right at your natural hairline.Make sure the ear tags lay evenly at your temples.

, Hair pins are open and bobby pins are closed. This is why bobby pins are better for securing your wig. Start piercing the bobby pins through the wig, the wig cap, and into your hair below. Work your bobby pins into the wig all along its edges at every angle possible. Your wig will be more and more stable with every pin you use.


You will probably use at least 10 bobby pins to secure the wig.
Be careful not to poke yourself in the scalp.

, Test it by jumping up and down, shaking your head vigorously from side to side, flinging the wig hair around, and touching your toes. If you've added enough pins, the wig should stay firmly in place through all of this and not wiggle at all. Add more pins if the wig does move around., Once the wig is securely in place, you can style it to your liking. You may not need to style it, but you will probably want to at least brush it down from testing it out. Hairspray is damaging to synthetic wigs, so you should only hold the style of the wig with hairspray if it is made of human hair."

, If you don't have a friend who is willing to be your photographer, then you will definitely need a tripod. Get one that can rotate in different directions. You can find tripods cheaply online, and there are even tripods for phones. (Make sure that your phone camera has a timer. Apps are available for this.)

, If taking indoor pictures, go to an area with good lighting. If taking an outdoor picture, go to a place where your picture-taking won't be disturbed; this might be your backyard or a balcony. If taking photos in a forest or park, make sure that no one is there. (Also, try to prevent your costume from getting muddy or dirty.)

, Decide how many pictures to take in each location, what poses you'll do in each picture, what props you might need, and other important information for each picture. Having a really specific list will help.

, Put on your costume, style your wig, and do all your make-up. Be picture-ready!

,, Fix yourself up one last time and gather your props. If taking a picture with another person, make sure that they do the same.


Take along a hand-held mirror to check your appearance. This is especially important if it is breezy.

, Set the timer for as long as you need. Then get into the pose.

, After the photo is taken, check it. If something is wrong, fix it and take the picture again. It's a good idea to take several pictures anyway, so that you can choose from the best of the lot.

, After all the pictures are taken, upload them into a computer and sort through them.


Enhance your photos with Photoshop or other photo-editing software. This is optional but can allow you to brighten photos, cut out unnecessary elements, etc.

, Send your pictures to a modeling company, or post them on your social media page. Do whatever you want with your awesome photos!

",How to Take Good Cosplay Selfies," You'll be needing an actual camera for this if possible. If you don't have a proper camera, a phone or an iPod will work just as well, but you will get a better picture quality from an actual camera. It doesn't have to be a big, expensive one. Just a simple digital camera will do.;
, It's better to fit the background to your character (can you really imagine Sherlock Holmes taking selfies in a bathroom mirror?). If in doubt, use your back garden or a large, outdoor area as you will usually get better light outside as well as more choice of backgrounds for your shots. Good place ideas for shots include brick walls, woods, lakes, or even simple park benches.

, If you own a tripod, then that would be perfect, but if not, anything from a pile of books to a window ledge will do.

, You don't want to have a beautiful photo of you in costume, but the top of your head is missing. If the camera is too low or high, adjust it accordingly. Also, be sure to check whether any large props will fit within the frame of the camera - that epic scythe you made will just look like a big black stick if the blade is cropped off the top of the shot.

, Something that will fit the character, for example if you are cosplaying as Naruto, perhaps make a peace sign with your fingers and pull a huge grin. If you are cosplaying as Hermione Granger, perhaps bring a book with you and pretend to read. Try to be as creative with poses as possible; many of the same poses are used time and time again but a unique idea will make your cosplay stand out even if the costume isn't 100% accurate.

, About 10 seconds should do it, so you can get into position. If you have a large prop to adjust or it is hard to move in your costume then you may need more time.

, Remember, you don't necessarily have to be staring straight into the camera.

, Some cameras have features that let you take lots of shots in quick succession automatically. You could try setting this on your camera too, for more interesting shots.

, Never use the delete button on a camera. Digital cameras don't have a recycle bin; once you delete a photo, it will be gone for good. It is safer to get rid of the ones you don't want on a computer so if you delete one by accident, you can retrieve it from the recycle bin.

, Now, don't worry if you don't have Photoshop. You don't need it for minor edits. Simply left click the photo you want to edit, click 'open with' and select 'Windows Live Photo Gallery'. Once this is open, click 'Fix' in the toolbar and then edit to your hearts content. You can change the brightness, colouration and even straighten the angle of the photo. You can also fix red-eye caused by staring into the flash of the camera.

Buy high-quality reeds to start with.,
Break new reeds in gradually, so the dried material gets used to being wet again.,
Before playing, soak your reed in clean water instead of wetting it with your saliva, if possible.

,
After playing, rinse the reed in clean water.,
Rotate your reeds.,
Store your reeds responsibly, with a good reed case.,
Soak your reeds in a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (available at your local drugstore) from time to time.,
Use common sense to avoid broken reeds.",How to Extend the Life of a Clarinet Reed," Off-brand or generic reeds simply do not play as well or last as long as their more expensive counterparts. Clarinet players of every skill level have had success with Vandorens, but there are other brands out there as well. If price proves to be an obstacle, know where to find deals. While a box of 10 Vandorens may cost 3 or 4 dollars per reed through your local music store, if you buy in bulk from online suppliers, you may be able to get them at half that price.;
, Lay new reeds on a flat surface and firmly rub them from the heart to the tip with the back of a teaspoon. This enhances the reed's life expectancy by closing its fibers.

,, Then dry it, with a cotton cloth of handkerchief, moving towards the tip. Alternatively, if you're in a hurry, just pass it between your thumb and index finger - again, moving towards the tip.

, Have three or four good ones with you at any given time, and play with a different one every time, instead of playing on just one reed for a long stretch and then starting over with another new one.

, The type of case you need may depend on what type of reed you use, how wet your reeds are when you put them away, and other factors.


Reeds dry best in a well-ventilated case with a ribbed floor, so air can get everywhere.
Other cases have glass floors to prevent waves from forming at the tip of the reed.
Humidity is always a factor in the lifespan of a reed. Some cases come with replaceable cartridges containing a substance that regulates the humidity level within the case.
Avoid storing reeds in the little plastic individual cases they are sold in. While there's nothing wrong with them, it is easier to lose or mix up individually stored reeds, and they'll start to pile up after a while.
Never keep reeds in a case that is completely closed. They will go moldy.

, This counteracts the effects of your saliva. Leave the reeds in the solution overnight and rinse them well before you use them again.

, Don't leave your clarinet standing on its bell with the reed on it (this is a bad idea in the first place, but why risk losing a good reed too?). If you're taking a break from playing, put a mouthpiece cap over the reed to protect it and keep it moist. Don't ""wall test"" reeds just for the fun of it.

, Sea nymphs naturally have long, thick hair, so have layers cut to give the impression that your hair is thicker and a bit longer every few weeks. Usually, a side part is best. You also want to have wavy hair. You could, every night, french braid your hair, sleep on it, and take the braid out the next day. Another option is to get up a bit earlier than usual and curl your hair in a few thick rings.

, Everybody knows that werewolves change on the full moon. Well it's the same with Wolfbloods. Every full moon, you should act worried, like you're going to be late for something, keep checking the clock, especially when it gets close to sunset. If you are with friends, or at school, excuse yourself, and rush off home. Don't answer your phone that night if anybody calls to see where you are.

, This is when there is no moon in the sky. Act really tired, not like you can't be bothered with your schoolwork, just super tired. You could even stay awake as long as possible, and get up early to make it more realistic.

, If you are a girl or a boy. Wolfbloods and werewolves just don't wear dresses or skirts. Also, if you wear it, keep the make-up to a minimum. If you can't help it, apply just basic make-up, perhaps black eye-liner. You want to look as normal as you can, as if you are trying not to get noticed, of course, you are trying to get noticed and Show off by playing a game of pretend.

, Brown is often seems in forecasts too, wear brown if you like. If you want to wear muted autumnal colors, that's an option too.

, This is a wolf's sign of challenging or dislike.

,, Pretend to be able to see really far and pick up scents.

, Hide a small object that is not easily found, but make sure you remember where you put it. Ask them to help you find it, and, when you are sure they can see you, lift your nose into the air, or take a sniff at the air, and pretend to follow a 'scent trail' to your object. Say 'Oh, look, I've found it.' If you see them looking at you strangely, look a little worried and hurry on.

, Pretend to be obsessed with meat if you are not already. Wolfbloods and werewolves love meat.

, Wolves are afraid of fire, so are Wolfbloods. If your parents light a fire in the grate, hang back and eye it wearily. If you are at a bonfire with your friends, growl/snarl so they can hear you, but others can't. You don't want to be labelled as a psycho, you are just playing a joke.

, As you probably remember, this is a wolf's sign of dislike or challenging.

, They could be another Wolfblood in your pack (perhaps you moved to the school together, to protect each other) or perhaps a werewolf hunter. That would make it interesting, and possibly more fun for you.

, You should tell your mum or dad you are playing a prank if you are going to be keeping up the act at home, so they don't get worried. Make sure you tell them it is a prank/joke, not say 'I'm a wolfblood', or they'll take you to a psychiatrist.

, If you are ready to give up the act, announce to everybody you were pranking that it was all a joke. They will either laugh or be really cross. If they are really your friends, they will get over it, so don't worry. If you want to keep the act up for as long as you know your friends, start on the last couple of years of school so you don't have to keep it up for that long. It will get a bit boring if you have to keep up the pretence all the time, so it's no recommended holding up until University. You can keep the act up for as long as you want, but sometimes it becomes a bit of a chore, it's not meant to be a chore, it's meant to be a game.

, The night before, check again to make sure you have everything, then pack it up. Check things off on your list as you go. Don't just throw everything into a bag an hour before your train leaves.

, Make sure that all its pieces are on your list and marked off. Forgetting a crucial part can make all that hard work and patient waiting go right down the drain. To be sure you have everything, put it on. Look it over, make double sure you've got all its parts, then pack it away. Put all the parts together if you can. Also, if you can wear any parts as street clothes, then do that. It saves space for other things, and ensures that you don't forget it. You can't forget what's attached to your body. Just know what's acceptable and what's going to look silly. Ask yourself, ""Would I wear this in school/at work?"" If yes, then wear it. If no, pack it away.

, Make very sure you have the right tickets for both the con and your transportation there.

, Are you meeting someone? If so, when and where? When is mealtime? Bathroom breaks? Time to go home? Get a copy of the con schedule if you can, and then plan your day around that. Mark down what you really want to see. Wear a watch, or something else with a clock on it, regardless of how badly it clashes with your costume. It's better to look a tiny bit less realistic then miss a favourite event, or your ride home, so plan ahead!

You will be on your feet a lot, surrounded by hundreds of other people, all jostling and yelling. It will be tiring. Go to bed now, get what sleep you can. Sleep on the way there too, if you can. Being tired will lead to misery later on, after hours of walking around. So go to sleep.

, Once you're on your way, don't be nervous. Cons are a ton of fun if you're prepared. Chances are you'll meet people there who will become good friends. Go there with a mindset of, ""I'm going to have fun!"" Thinking, ""This will stink"" will make it stink. Your fellow con goers are just like you, and everyone always is super-nice. You'll have fun, but not if you don't turn that frown upside-down.

Play songs you know.",How to Warm Up Before Playing the Clarinet1," Play a song like 'Hot Cross Buns', raising the volume to its full dynamic level with clarity, and then bringing the sound back down to the softest possible. Do this on some notes without the register key down, then some notes with it down, and finally some of the harder altissimo notes. Time yourself to make it more interesting- aim for holding the note at least 25 seconds.;
"
"
Understand the importance of warming.,
Finger a low “E.” Place your right hand to the lowest “E” note, but don’t hold anything else down.,
Blow air through the instrument.,
Play scales.,
Repeat the blowing process.",How to Tune a Clarinet1," When you play the clarinet for an extended amount of time, your clarinet is warmed by your breath. As the clarinet warms from playing or from air temperature, the tuning becomes sharper, or higher pitched. Since the tuning is effected by heat, you should warm the clarinet before you play., You don’t need to actually play a low “E.” By holding this note down, you can spread air through the clarinet more efficiently.

, Take a deep breath before blowing air through the clarinet. Then extend a long flow of air through the clarinet. Again, you shouldn’t hear any notes when you do this technique. Spend about five minutes warming your clarinet by using this technique.

, Another way to warm up both your instrument and yourself is by practicing a few scales. Play through a range of minor, major, and pentatonic scales. Your clarinet may not sound in-tune, but it's more important to heat the instrument to an average playing temperature.You can also practice melodies you are currently working on. Be sure to play with firm breathing instead of soft breathing while warming up.

, After playing through familiar scales, go back and simply blow air through the clarinet. Place your finger on a low ""E"" and blow air through the instrument. Imagine blowing hot air to warm your hands in the winter. Take this same breathing technique and apply it to the clarinet.

"
"
Play a chromatic scale as long tones.,
Always play scales and arpeggios.",How to Warm Up Before Playing the Clarinet2," Set your metronome to mm=60, start at the bottom E, and play it for 4 counts. Play the scale in groups of 4 notes (16 seconds in total), followed by a 4-count break as you take a deep breath. Example: E, F, F#, G (breath); G#, A, B♭, B (breath), and so on.

, This will warm up your fingers and they are also technique exercises that are crucial in all musical practice. Learn all 12 major scales, the related minors and the chromatic scale (full range from low E to altissimo C).

"
"
Practice register slurs.,
Do altissimo slurs.,
For Bb clarinets only:


Start on the lowest note, and put the register key down, raising the note an octave.",How to Warm Up Before Playing the Clarinet3," These are like long tones except that at the peak of volume you add the register key. For example, on low E you would go to middle line B.

, These are challenging at first, so don't give up on them. Start on the E with the register key and then lift your top finger. If you are new to the altissimo register this is actually a half step higher than C with only the back hole down and the register key. Keep doing this until you get to A with the register key down. For the notes to respond, you need a fast air stream and pressure.

, Play the chromatic scale slowly.
Start on first line e, and go to the lowest note (very low E).
After you get to the lowest E, put the register key down. Then stop for 1 2 beats, then play the second lowest note, (very low F) and put the register key down.
Keep doing this until you get to the first line E again.
Start on low G, and put the register key down. Then slide your left pointer (first key finger, of the finger that plays A) down just a little, so that you are just halfway covering the hole. do this little, and only do it if you are experienced.

"
"
If you are a beginner, a good warm-up exercise is called Mississippi Hot Dog.",How to Warm Up Before Playing the Clarinet4," To do this exercise, start on the lowest note you can easily play and play four quarter notes and two half notes, or short-short-short-short-long-long. Do this twice on each note until you have gone as high as you can.

Understand clarinet keys.,
Get a chromatic tuner.,
Play the lower octave.,
Adjust the barrel.,
Play an octave sharper.,
Adjust at the halfway point.,
Test each note on the clarinet.",How to Tune a Clarinet2," Clarinets are designed to be transposed to match other players’ keys. For most standard clarinets, you will be one whole tone flatter. A “C” for most instruments can be played by playing a “C,” but a clarinet will play a D to reach a “C.”This is the reason people call the clarinet a transposing instrument. Transposing means to fix the notes to match up with the instrument. To transpose a piece for the clarinet, you would need to raise each note a whole step.

, A standard chromatic tuner costs about $25 and can be found in any music shop or online. You can also download a chromatic tuner app for you smartphone, if you have the means. Chromatic tuners are ideal because they will show you what note you are playing.


Make sure your tuner is set up with a microphone as opposed to being used as a guitar pedal.
You can choose to tune to any key, but for this demonstration, tune to concert “C.” Concert “C” for most clarinets is D.

, It is best to start with the lower register of the clarinet and move down to the other sections. Play a low D while facing your tuner. The tuner should detect the note as around a C. It’s okay if the note isn’t in tune because you’re going to fix that.


Play a firm D and don’t use a softer tone. Playing softly on the clarinet will produce a sharper tone.

, Now you need to adjust the barrel to better tune your lowest octave. For sharp notes, you will extend your instrument. When you are too flat, you will shorten your instrument to sharpen the tone. Make your initial adjustments to the upper barrel about a half millimeter either by pulling or pushing. Play that same note and take note of your tuner.


You’ll probably need to experiment for a bit to get a close enough note. The ideal tune will be slightly sharp. Make sure the tuning needle is roughly in the center to indicate in-tune.Make as many adjustments as needed.

, Now play a D an octave higher while facing your tuner. For most clarinets, this octave is too sharp. Take note of what the chromatic tuner indicates. Tuning the higher pitched notes uses the same principles as the lower octave., Make your adjustments to the halfway part of the clarinet. If your D is sharp pull the clarinet about half a millimeter. Play the note again facing your tuner and see if you are closer to being in-tune. Continue to adjust until you’ve reached the sweet spot of being slightly sharp.


Make sure you line up your bridge key properly before playing the higher notes., Go through each note on your clarinet with your tuner. For your left-hand notes, or the lower octave, you will make any adjustments to the barrel. For any of the higher pitched notes, or the right handed notes, make adjustments at the halfway part of the clarinets.

"
"
Plan to tune with the group.,
Play the lower octave.,
Adjust the barrel.,
Play an octave sharper.,
Adjust at the halfway point.",How to Tune a Clarinet3," If you are in an orchestra or band at school, the group will always have a note that everyone will tune with. Most will play a concert “C” or “G.” During rehearsals, your group will let you know what note they will be tuning to. You will be responsible for transposing a half note below the said note.


If the band is tuning to a concert “C,” you will tune the clarinet to a D., Always start with the lowest octave on your clarinet. Tuning with a band requires you to utilize your ears over anything else. Determine if your low octave is in-tune by focusing on your own sound in relationship to everyone else.

, Make adjustments to the low octave by adjusting the upper barrel. Pull the barrel when sharp and and push the barrel when flat. Make your adjustments in intervals of about half a millimeter.It’s better to tune at home before practicing with the band. This way you are ready and won’t need to make large tuning adjustments.

, Usually a band will play the tuning note twice. The second time is for you to check the tuning of the higher octave of your clarinet. During the second duration of the tuning note, play the higher octave of D. Again, the higher octave is usually out of tune and a bit sharp., Make adjustments to the higher octave by adjusting the halfway section. Pull the halfway part when sharp and push the halfway part when flat. Make your adjustments in intervals of about half a millimeter.


Make sure you line up your bridge key after making adjustments.

,
Take off the barrel of the clarinet.,
Pull the upper and lower joints apart.,
Take the bell off.,
Put the parts away.",How to Take Apart a Clarinet," First, loosen the screws so taking if off would require little to no pressure to the reed, as it is very delicate. Keep it aside; unpacking the full clarinet might require to use the ligature again.;
, If played for a long time, the reed would most likely stick on due to the moisture in the reed. Take it off gently and remove excess moisture. Put it in its reed case and put it away.

, Most people take the mouthpiece off first. Unlike the rest of the clarinet, do not run a swab through the mouthpiece. Instead, clean it separately about once every one or two weeks.

,, Sometimes the barrel can get a bit stuck, so carefully grip the clarinet in a way that does not bend the keys when you pull on the barrel. A good method for doing so is to grip the top of the first section with one hand, and to twist the barrel while pulling upwards with the other hand. Usually the barrel collects the most spit out of all the parts of the clarinet, so taking the swab and dabbing out excess water inside of it is usually a good idea.

, These can sometimes be hard to remove as well, so like with the barrel, take care not to damage any keys when pulling them apart. A good method for doing this is to grip each joint with one hand, and to twist slightly back and forth while pressing down on the bridge key as you pull them out.

, Simply grip the bell with one hand and the lower half of the bottom joint with the other. Carefully pull the bell off.

, Put the parts in their proper spots. If you have trouble closing the case, one or more parts have been put in wrong.

Join your school band or orchestra.",How to Play the Clarinet," If you're just starting out for school band, it's common to rent a clarinet from the school, or from a music shop in your town. It's much easier to learn on a properly maintained instrument that's new, instead of one that's been sitting in the attic gathering mildew. It's also a lot cheaper than buying a new model.


If you're a beginner, a plastic clarinet is recommended. A Buffet B12 or Yamaha 255 are both popular models, but stick to a plastic first instrument as wood clarinets can be more difficult to play and maintain. It's usually common to use a soft reed; 2 to 2 and a half will most often work.
If you have an old clarinet you want to use, take it into a music shop to get it fixed up. The pads will likely need to be changed, to make sure you get a clear tone from the horn.;
, Most clarinets come in carrying cases, with fitted slots for each component of the instrument. When it's time to take it out and put it together, inspect the case to make sure you've got all the parts ready to go in good working order.The pieces are assembled from bottom to top, in the following order:


The bell is the bottom component of the horn, and it fans out like a megaphone.
The bottom stack makes up the main body of the clarinet, and it will have a cork connection piece on only one end of the section.
The top stack makes up the other major section of the main body of the clarinet, and will have cork on both ends of the section. Line up the straight metal hinge on both pieces to orient the barrel properly.
The barrel should be a short piece, 3-4 inches long, and slightly more flared at one end than the other.
The mouthpiece is the top-most section of the instrument, and should come with a metal or leather ligature, which is used to hold the reed in place. Line up the bottom of the mouthpiece with the long straight octave key on the instrument.

, Slide the reed between the ligature and mouthpiece, with the flat part facing in. Tighten the nobs on the ligature until it's tight enough to stay on. When taking the clarinet part be careful not to let the screws fall out; they are extremely hard to get back in. Over-tightening can strain the mouthpiece, so be gentle.


Don't put the reed higher than the mouthpiece, which makes it extremely difficult to produce a note. The tip of the reed should fall even with the tip of the mouthpiece.

, The clarinet should be held away from yourself, at a 45 degree angle, the bell just past your knees. Keep your head up and your back straight when playing. The clarinet should come to your mouth, your mouth shouldn't go to the clarinet.


The clarinet should be held with your right hand on the bottom stack, your thumb on the thumb-rest on the back of the stack. Your other three fingers should rest on the three corresponding keyholes.
Your left hand should hold the instrument on the top stack. Your thumb should rest on the octave key on the back of the instrument. Your other three fingers will rest on the three main keys on the bottom of the top stack.
When your fingers are not in use, keep them very close to the holes to make it easier for them to get to the keys when they are needed. If you keep your fingers too far away from the clarinet, it will make it difficult to play fast things.

, If you try to play on a dry reed, it will sound bad and will probably squeak more often. Before a performance or practice session, place your reed in a small jar or wet with saliva.


Try to start with a softer reed, between sizes 1 and 2.5. As your mouth muscles get stronger, you will start needing harder reeds.
You will know when to bump up reeds when your clarinet starts sounding like a person talking with their nose plugged. Your teacher will also tell you if you need a softer or harder reed.

, Every time you play your clarinet, you need to take it apart and clean it to keep moisture from accumulating inside the horn. You can clean the instrument fairly quickly and easily.


Most horns should come with a cleaning rag, which you can draw through the body of the horn after each use. One end should have a string attached, which you use to pull through each section of the horn. It only takes a minute, but helps to keep your horn in good working order.
Every now and then, it's also good to use a Q-TIp to clean around the connection points, where little particles and saliva can accumulate.Grease your corks regularly. It can make it hard to put together and take apart your clarinet if you let the corks dry up. Once you play your clarinet a lot you can grease the corks about once a week. If you grease the corks too much they may slide off.

, Say ""whee"" and while holding this shape, say ""too"". Hold this shape (known as your embouchure) and put the clarinet in your mouth.


Keep your jaw flat. Your top teeth should be planted firmly on the top of your mouthpiece, opposite of the reed side.
If you just push the horn into your mouth and blow, it'll be hard to make a note. It takes a little work in making the right shape with your mouth, called the embouchure.

, If your lips aren't sealing it enough, air will escape and no sound will come out. Try to lift the corners of your mouth to tighten it even more. Your tongue should be pointing at the reed when you play, but not touching it.


This may be hard to get used to at first and you will probably learn it best by taking lessons.

, With your mouth properly position, just try to blow to make a tone. Experiment with different strengths of breath, and get a sense of how much it takes to get a good-sounding tone from the horn. It'll take some work. With no keys pressed, you'll play an open G on the clarinet.


If you squeaked, don't be discouraged. It's hard to get used to the clarinet mouth shape. Just keep trying, and experimenting with different amounts of air to put through the horn.

, It can be tempting to puff out your cheeks when you play, but you'll get a more even and consistent tone if you avoid this. Practice playing in the mirror to avoid puffing them out.At first, this may make you squeak much more. If you squeak a lot, check where your mouth is on the mouthpiece. Make sure it is not too high or low on your mouthpiece. Your teacher can help you with this. Also make sure your reed is lined up correctly.

, Push down some keys to experiment with different notes, seeing how it changes the strength that you need to use to blow through the horn. try to get a sense of what makes the sound go higher and lower. Just play around for a while.


When you are playing, always cover the holes completely. If you don't, the notes won't come out. Especially when you are using the register key, be sure that all holes are covered completely., Check out your local music store again and see what kinds of beginner clarinet books they have. Some commonly used ones are Band Expressions, Standard of Excellence, and Rubank Elementary Method. All of them will teach you how to play songs and learn the proper fingerings for each note.It'll be hard to go very far on clarinet without learning to read sheet music. The clarinet is a treble-clef instrument in the Bb range, so you'll need to learn the basics of the treble clef to learn more about playing the instrument. The best way to do this is usually school band or private lessons.

, If you practice scales and arpeggios, your technique for solos and other repertoire will be much smoother. Finger patterns are essential for playing clarinet well, and you can learn those quickly by practicing these runs.


These will probably be taught to you eventually by your teacher eventually, if you have one.

, As with any instrument, if you're just playing for fun, start off with things you know. there are plenty of (not too challenging) popular pieces for the clarinet, especially if you like swing and jazz, which is more intuitive. The classical repertoire can be more demanding, but there are easier pieces here if you look hard enough.

, It's very hard to learn to play clarinet just from reading a book. It's best to start out with a teacher instead of on your own so that you won't miss anything or learn anything wrong. Often, school music teachers will offer lessons for cheap.


Bad habits can develop without you even knowing, which can make it hard to get past a certain skill level. If you want to play clarinet the right way, take lessons.

, If you are truly interested in playing the clarinet, find a teacher and join a band or orchestra.


Prepare for the long haul! You aren't going to become a good player overnight. Start with the basics then move on to more advanced things. Playing an instrument is a life-long learning project.

Let things progress naturally.",How to Teach Someone to Play Clarinet," You shouldn't even attempt to teach until you have several years' playing experience, and have a good understanding of music theory.


You'll also need a college degree if you plan to become a band director at a school, but this isn't as important if you're just teaching your little sibling, the kid down the street, or the freshman saxophone player who just switched to clarinet.;
, Chances are, your first teaching experience will just ""happen"" somewhat informally, when someone comes to you interested in playing.


You might want to get a start by talking to junior members of your band who are having trouble or offering to help out at a local elementary or middle school (if you went there yourself, the director will probably be thrilled to have your help).
If you plan to give private lessons for money, try putting an ad in the newspaper.

, If you've been playing for a good while, you've probably owned at least two clarinets in that time.


If you're teaching someone who doesn't yet have their own clarinet, you may offer to start them on your old beginner model, so that you're not held responsible by any parents if it doesn't work out and they've just spent several hundred dollars on a new clarinet. #*They'll also need, at the very least, a couple of reeds (2 - 3 strength, for a brand new beginner), and at least the bare minimum of supplies to keep the clarinet clean - a swab.
If you're teaching a student who already plays in a school band and owns this stuff, you're in good shape.

, Get an idea of how much your pupil already knows about music and ask if they've ever played an instrument before.


Young clarinet players have often played an instrument such as the recorder in elementary school, and it has many similarities to the clarinet.
If they've already been doing some playing by themselves or are in a band, have them play for you to get an idea of how much they've learned and what they might need to work on.
For a complete beginner, this will be your opportunity to teach them the basics, such as how to assemble the clarinet, how to produce a sound and form a good embouchure, and their first few notes.
Bottom line E and the D and C below that are good first notes, as they're in an easy playing range, and they're fingered the same way as G, A, and B on the recorder, meaning that the student will probably make the connection and realize that they can already play a few songs.

, With every lesson, introduce more notes and new rhythms. Begin teaching basic dynamics and articulations.


You may wish to find a good series of method books to use to help the student move ahead. #*Encourage them to practice and stay involved with music, and progress through middle and high school bands.
You may want to see if you can get the student involved with an event such as Solo and Ensemble when they're ready, or have them audition for an honor band.
Keep in mind that if they're a part of a school program, you may want to mention all this to their band director before you start sending in entry forms.

, Teaching music isn't a science. Every student will be different - some will learn very quickly, and some may take a little more effort.


There's no set time in which a clarinet player must become great. Just continue helping them along.

Decide on a basic personality.,
Exaggerate your emotions.,
Include some habits or gestures.,
Have a trademark quote.,
Try a tsundere character type if you want to explore two different sides.,
Choose a kuudere character type if you like to be calm, collected, and serious.,
Go dandere if you don't mind being shy or a little antisocial.",How to Act Like an Anime or Manga Character1," Anime and manga characters are not much different from real people. There are shy characters, funny characters, sarcastic characters, etc. Even if you aren't imitating a specific character, having some sort of base personality in mind will help. Once you have a base to work off of, you can add the extras that make the character more anime or manga-like.


Don't know what sort of personality to choose? Try picking one opposite to your own! If you are shy, try acting like a bold or hyper character!
Consider basing your character's personality off of an existing one. For example, you could be cold like Sephiroth from ""Final Fantasy 7."";
, If you watch anime or read manga, you will notice that many of the characters' reactions are pretty extreme. Take your desired personality's basic traits, and exaggerate them. If you want to be happy, act extra happy. If you want to be cold or serious, act extra cold or serious.


One of the most notable is Edward Elric from ""Fullmetal Alchemist"". He gets very upset whenever someone implies that he is short.
There are many emotionless archetypes as well. Instead of exaggerating your emotions, try concealing them and acting cool, calm, and collected.

, Everyone has their own little habit or gesture, such as twirling their hair or a specific way of laughing. Anime and manga characters are no exception. One great example would be L's toe-rubbing in ""Death Note."" Even if you are acting like a generic character, you can make your acting more believable by including a unique habit or gesture. Here are some ideas to get you started:


A sarcastic character may cock his eyebrow.
A shy girl may play with her hair.
An enthusiastic character my pump his fist into the air.
A tsundere may cross her arms or pout—especially when talking to her crush!

, Similar to habits and gestures, having a quote that you say often can help bring out the anime or manga vibes. One popular example is Naruto, who often says, ""Believe it!"" Other words and phrases include things like: feh, meh, and baka (idiot). If you have a favorite anime or manga character, you can use some of their most common phrases as inspiration.

, Tsunderes are known for being calm and collected, except when they are around someone they like. In those cases, they are easily embarrassed and often act mean in order to hide their feelings.They will help the one they like, but they will usually say something like:""It's not like I like you or anything.""
""I'm only doing this because I like you. Don't get any funny ideas!""
If they accidentally touch someone they like, they might say: ""It's not like I meant to do that. Don't take it personally!""

, These are the trademarks of kuuderes, especially in tough situation where everyone else is panicking. They tend to speak monotone and are afraid of showing their emotions or weakness, and are natural leaders.They do have a soft side, however, which they show to the one person they trust. Sometimes it's a love interest and sometimes it's not.Focus less on your emotions and more on the facts. That flower over there? Don't mention how it is beautiful or how it makes you feel. It's a red flower. The end.
Keep your expressions minimal. A tiny, slight smile is fine if someone you like says something hilarious.Kuudere can be snarky or dry witted., Deep down inside, they may want to be social, but are too shy or afraid to go out and open up. Once they get close to someone, they do open up, and are usually cutesy and optimistic.Due to their quietness and shyness, they may come off as a little emotionless, but not cold like a kuudere.


A great way to act shy would be to utter phrases such as ""uh"" or ""um."" You could also stutter a bit and talk softly.
Most dandere won't speak unless spoken to, or unless they absolutely have to (ie: being called on in class).You don't have to be completely antisocial. Many dandere have that one special person that they do talk to."

Choose a character.,
Study their scenes.,
Read up on your character online.,
Mimic your character's way of speaking.,
Learn some phrases.,
Check your posture and body language.,
Consider having a prop that the character is famous for.",How to Act Like an Anime or Manga Character2," Most people find it easiest to portray a character who is similar to them personality-wise. On the other hand, some people find it easier to portray a character who is the complete opposite.


Consider starting out with two characters: one who is similar to you and one who is completely different. If one is too hard to mimic, forget about him/her, and focus on the easier one.

, If possible, try to read the manga and watch the anime. Take note of how your character reacts to different situations. Notice the range of their emotions and how they act when they are happy, sad, angry, or afraid. Study how the character acts around different characters: family, friends, enemies, strangers.


If your character is stoic, pay extra attention. These types of characters usually do display emotions, albeit subtly.
Don't stop at just the anime or manga. If they appear in a video game, watch cut scenes from the game!

, The internet is full of information. If possible, try to find the anime or manga's official site, and read up on your character. Unofficial or fan-created material can be helpful, but take it with a grain of salt. Many fans add their own interpretation of the character, which may not necessarily be canon.

, This does not mean that you have to mimic their voice, although you can certainly try. Instead, note how they talk. Do they talk slow or fast? Loud or soft? Does their voice display a full range of emotions or is it stoic and blank? Note any rises and falls of pitch. Try to mimic these when you talk.

, You can take things a step further by learning a few common phrases that your character says. If you aren't copying a particular character, you can learn a few basic words or phrases in Japanese.

, Acting is more than just talking and mimicking facial expressions. Re-watch your character's scenes, and note how they stand, walk, or move. Shy characters may slouch and try to ""hide"" behind their hands. Confident or arrogant characters will often stand up straight, hold their heads up high, and puff their chests out.


Don't forget about their quirks! Does your character have any specific quirks? Do they play with their hair or do a specific gesture? Take note of that!

, Is your character known for having a certain object with them? If so, consider carrying a similar object with you! A notable example is L from ""Death Note"", who is often depicted with a piece of cake. You could bring a prop or real slice of cake with you. Another example is Nekozawa from ""Ouran High School Host Club,"" who always has his Belzenef puppet with him.


Do not rely on the prop. Use it to enhance your acting. Do not allow it to do the work for you.

"
"
Understand that not everything is socially acceptable.,
Know when and when not to act like your character.,
Don't force people to play along.,
Be yourself.",How to Act Like an Anime or Manga Character3," Your character's behavior might be considered the norm in his or her world. Parts of it may not be in this one. Even in conventions, there are some behaviors that are frowned upon. This includes things like hitting, groping, swearing excessively, and so forth. If you think it may get you in trouble, don't do it.


If you character is very mean, consider downplaying that aspect of their personality. This way, you won't offend or hurt other people.
This doesn't mean that you can't act like your desired character at all. Mimic the good and exclude the bad.

, While acting like an anime character may seem cool and fun, there are times when you need to take things more seriously. If you are around people who may not be familiar with the anime, or the fact that you are pretending, it is best to be yourself.


For example: fans of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" might find it amusing if you rage about your lack of height like Edward Elric. Your doctor certainly will not.

, If you are cosplaying at a convention, some people may react to your acting and play along, especially if they are also cosplaying. Not every cosplayer will, however. If you mimic your character and they don't respond, leave them be. Not everyone will want to ""role play.""


Watch their body language for cues. If they seem uncomfortable or agitated, such as shuffling, looking around, or making excuses, leave them be.

, Don't become the character and forget who you are deep down inside. Remember, your friends chose you for who you are, and not the anime or manga character you are portraying.


At the same time, consider using some of your character's aspects to better yourself. For example, if your character is a great listener, try focusing on that aspect of your character outside of acting.

, Sometimes these can come unhooked during frenzied playing or otherwise and can be refastened relatively easily depending on the location and the obstacles to get to it. Be careful not to dislodge any others on your reach, bend any rods, or prick yourself.

, If it sounds healthy, put the mouthpiece onto the neck and play. Again, if it sounds OK, attach this to the body and try again. You can try to identify what section the problem may be arising from.

, Remove the neck and fashion the flashlight so it will shine into the body of the saxophone without any light escaping. Hold the sax and pretend to play a low Bb (as to close every hole in the instrument. You might have to have someone hold the flashlight). Cover the bell with a towel or something opaque. Turn on the flashlight. The light should shine through wherever there are leaks that you may have missed on your initial look-over. If you discover one, tighten any screws, fix any springs, or take your instrument to your local repair shop and show them your findings.

, If in doubt, and you have applied all of the above steps, go to a repair shop and list what you have checked. The person will be much happier for you giving them basic information, rather than testing it all themselves.

Dress in expensive-looking clothing.,
Care for your hair.,
Consider dressing like a certain tsundere.,
Check out zettai ryouiki if you wear skirts or short shorts.,
Make your school uniform look good on you.,
Consider carrying a signature item.",How to Act Tsundere1," Many tsunderes are spoiled and/or rich, and some of them just want a ""prim-and-proper"", clean-cut look to them. While there's no tsundere ""dress code"", so to speak, the best look would be something that looks expensive and classy, such as a neat sweater and jeans without holes, or a cute dress. Check out what kinds of clothes you can find that you think would match the tsundere archetype.


Some tsunderes dress typically, or for the girls, in a more tomboyish style. You don't have to wear super-expensive clothing just to look like a tsundere. Many of them actually look fairly normal.;
, Think about it - do you see a lot of tsunderes with less-than-stellar hair? Learning how to care for your hair is important for being a tsundere. Greasy, knotted hair just makes you look less like a tsundere, and more like a rabid otaku.


It's common for tsundere girls to have long hair, sometimes pinned up into ""twintails"" (ponytails on both sides of the head). It's not necessary to be a tsundere, but it's a nice touch.

, If there's a tsundere in particular that you have a liking for, check out their clothing and hair styles, and consider mimicking them. You don't want to completely copy off of them - you're not a clone of them, after all - but many tsunderes have a very distinctive style that you could loosely follow. Maybe you could make your own tsundere style!

, A common trait of tsundere girls is to wear thigh-high stockings while wearing a short skirt or shorts; in Japan, this is referred to as zettai ryouiki. There are many ""grades"" of zettai ryouiki, tsundere girls wearing Grade A or Grade B most of the time (socks that extend up to the thigh, with short shorts or a short skirt). If you want to up the tsundere image, check out zettai ryouiki.


Zettai ryouiki is fairly sexualized, so if you're not comfortable with it, you don't have to wear it. It's a personal choice. You don't have to wear something you're not comfortable with in order to be a tsundere.

, A general anime staple is focusing on high-school-age protagonists, so it's common to see tsunderes that wear school uniforms. If your school has a uniform, do everything in your power to make sure that it looks the best it can. Do any pinning, rolling, tucking, or searching for similar clothes to make yourself look as good as possible.


If your school doesn't have a uniform, consider dressing in a uniform-style fashion. Not only does it help you look more tsundere, it's also bound to look more clean-cut than just a shirt and jeans.

, Some tsunderes (though not all of them) carry around their own signature item. This could be something small, like a book or a piece of jewelry, or something huge and impossible to overlook. If you want to carry around a signature item, figure out what you like and consider carrying something like that. Get creative!



Don't carry a weapon! Though you might want to carry around a wooden katana like Taiga Aisaka from Toradora! does, carrying a weapon can get you in serious legal trouble. Stick with the stuff that won't be perceived as dangerous.

Keep practicing.",How to Play the Tenor Saxophone," You may be able to borrow one from a school for a small fee, rent one from a local music store, or buy a used one. If you're using a particularly used or old instrument, you may want to have a music store technician look it over to make sure it's in good shape for playing. In addition, you'll need to borrow or purchase the following...



A mouthpiece, if one doesn't already come with the instrument. Don't buy the cheapest one available, but don't splurge on a professional one yet, especially if you may not even stick with an instrument. You'll probably want one made of plastic or hard rubber.

A ligature, if not included with the horn. A metal one is fine, or you can spend a little extra for a leather one, which is more durable and produces a better sound.

Reeds: As a beginner, you'll want to start with strength 1.5 to 3 reeds and experiment to find a strength that produces the best effect with the least amount of effort. Good brands to start with are Rico and Vandoren.

Neck strap: Tenor saxophones are heavy, and impossible to play without additional support. You can purchase a relatively cheap and comfy neck strap at almost any music store.

Swab: Something as big as a tenor sax collects a lot of moisture when played. A swab is a piece of fabric (often silk) on a long string with a weight on the end that is pulled through the instrument to clean it.

Fingering chart: A fingering chart shows how to play all the notes in the range of the instrument, and you'll want to have one when learning to play.

Method book(s): While not required by any means, if you're learning on your own or would like some extra help, they are an excellent investment.;
, Attach the gooseneck (the short, curved metal piece - the curve is unique to the tenor sax) to the top of the body of the instrument and secure with the neck screw. Place the ligature on the mouthpiece and slide the reed under the ligature, securing it with the ligature screws. Attach your neck strap to the hook on the back of the instrument, put it around your neck, and stand up.

, Your left hand should be on the top and your right hand should be on the bottom. Your right thumb goes under the curved thumb rest towards the bottom of the instrument. Your right index, middle, and ring fingers go on the mother of pearl keys that should be easy to find. Your pinky will move the other keys at the bottom of the sax. Your left thumb should go on the round piece at the top of the instrument. You will see five mother of pearl keys at the top. Your index finger goes on the second one down, and your middle and ring fingers go on the fourth and fifth, respectively. Do not put any fingers on the tiny key, for this is only used in certain notes.

, Curl your lower lip over your bottom teeth slightly, and rest your top teeth on the top of the mouthpiece. You'll discover when you start playing that you may need to adjust this slightly.

, If you've done this right, you'll hear a C# (concert B). If you're not getting a sound or you're making a squeaking noise, adjust your embouchure until the tone improves. Also, if this bothers your top teeth, you can easily purchase a mouth pad, and the buzzing should stop.

,


Press the second mother of pearl key down with your left middle finger, leaving the others uncovered. This produces a C (concert Bb).
Press the first mother of pearl key down with your left index finger. This produces a B (concert A).
Press down the first and second mother of pearl keys. This produces an A (concert G).
Continue covering more holes, going down the scale. Three covered is a G, four is an F, five is an E, and six is a D (concert pitch F, Eb, D, and C, in order). You may have a little trouble with the lower notes at first, but it'll improve with practice. Also, when playing the lower notes, drop your jaw, and your sound will improve significantly.
Add the octave key (the metal key above your left thumb) to any of these fingerings to produce the same note, but an octave higher.
With the help of a fingering chart, move on to altissimo (really high) and really low notes in the range, as well as flat and sharp notes. In time, you will be able to play every note your saxophone can reach.

, If you're learning for a school band, you'll definitely get something to learn from there. Otherwise, visit a music store to buy sheet music and/or method books to begin to play from.

, With a lot of hard work and dedication, you'll get better and better at playing... who knows, you may be the next big name in jazz."

Develop an edge out in public.,
Be harsher towards your crush.,
Show a softer side in private.,
Take a passive-aggressive stance towards anything.,
Dismiss your emotions in the presence of those you don't know well.,
Take the edge off your act over time.,
React when someone pushes your buttons.,
Don't take the tsundere attitude too far.,
Back off if you accidentally cross a boundary.",How to Act Tsundere2," Obviously, don't be snarky to authority figures - that's just asking to get in trouble! However, being slightly aggressive and displaying a ""don't mess with me"" attitude will get the message across. Don't be arrogant, but act as though most people in general are below you, and as though your friends are the exception to that.


Don't be rude to people who don't know you - you shouldn't call someone an idiot just because they approached you and asked for directions. If the person is a stranger or barely an acquaintance, aim for being polite, but distant.
Common ways of showing an edge are to be sarcastic and being rude in a backhanded way.

, A common trait among many tsunderes is that in an attempt to hide their feelings towards their love interest, they act even harsher towards them. They may play hard-to-get, which is a very common trait of tsunderes, and have a constant back-and-forth love-hate relationship. Imitate this! Give your crush some attitude (but not so much that they dislike you), and swap back and forth between love and hate. It's a classic trait of tsunderes.


If your crush likes someone else or has a partner, be especially harsh towards that person. Insulting them subtly is a great way of getting across your feelings without really revealing it.
If your friends ask you if you like that person, give them a harsh reprimand (e.g. ""Idiot! As if I'd like !"").

, Whether you're with your crush or your friends, when there aren't others around, drop the attitude a bit and show your kinder, softer side. Don't totally drop the attitude, of course, but definitely tone it down a notch (or two, or three). Show them your sweet side - that's a side of you that they'll be wanting to see. Be nice in these moments, and they'll be wanting even more.


If your friends or your crush are sensitive and don't like your cold side, take these private moments to apologize to them. Be sure to let them know that while you do actually care about them, you have a different approach to getting that across. Let them know that they have merit in your eyes, but be subtle (if not a bit backhanded).

, Tsunderes are well-known for managing to take on a snarky attitude towards anything at all, whether it's something small or big. Being passive-aggressive and seeming like everything is merely a minor annoyance is a good way to act tsundere. Backhanded compliments and snarky remarks are the way to go.


Classic passive-aggressive lines dropped by tsunderes are ""It's not like I you or anything..."", ""I didn't do this for you! I did this because I wanted to!"", ""Idiot!"", and ""It's not like that!"".
If you give someone a gift, a good comment to make is, ""I suppose I should give you something... But I guess you deserve it"".

, If you're upset about anything, play it off as anger or frustration, or take an aloof, I-don't-care kind of attitude. Outwardly, blame it on someone else (e.g. ""That teacher is so stupid.""), and don't talk about how you feel to strangers. Remember, tsunderes are usually very barricaded by their rough, harsh exterior; you don't want to be an open book of emotions to people.


Of course, it's okay to have emotions; you're allowed to feel what you feel. Tsunderes just don't often show their vulnerable, more emotional side to strangers. If you need to cry, go to a close friend that you trust.
For your own emotional health, don't actually blame someone else for something or refuse to ever talk about your emotions. If you know you're in the wrong, own up to it, and find someone you can vent to.

, Remember, if tsunderes don't show a kind side over time, they're no better than jerks. Tsunderes also really do value the people they feel deserve their time, so be nicer to people who spend a lot of time around you, such as your friendly acquaintances and your crush. It'll show them that you really do care about them, and that your attitude is nothing more than a façade or defense mechanism.

, When tsunderes are provoked, they really take the bait, and react with a vengeance. If somebody bumps into you, a ""Hey, watch where you're going, you idiot!"" and fuming can have a great effect. And if somebody is rude to you or bullies you, react to it strongly - you're a tsundere, after all. Take it up a notch further than you already have!



Never physically attack someone. The constant hitting and attacking that you'd see in anime and manga would land you in police custody. A light slap on the upper arm might work with some people, though, as long as they don't mind play-punching.

, You're trying to be a tsundere, not verbally abusive towards anyone who says a word to you. Remember, tsunderes don't want to actually hurt people - they just want to take on an ""I can do this without you, better than you"" attitude. Don't bully or verbally attack people, especially if there's no justification for it. If you do, you'll just end up driving people away from you.



Never intentionally target someone's weak spots. If you know your friend or crush is sensitive about the fact that they're bad at socializing, don't attack their social skills. This can cause a serious hit to their self-esteem and will most likely drive them away from you. After all, who wants to be friends with a bully?

, An often-overlooked fact is that tsunderes do cause emotional pain at times, or overstep boundaries and attack things that others are sensitive about. In the real world, people will be much more vocal about you hurting their feelings than they will in anime or manga. If you do end up hurting someone, apologize immediately and back off. It's likely that all eyes will be on you, and you don't want to end up friendless. Tsunderes are capable of admitting they're in the wrong and being kind. After all, being a tsundere is all about revealing your kinder side to people.

Change your speech and pronunciation.,
Adopt his persona.,
Expand your vocabulary.,
Dress like him.,
Change your diet to reflect his.",How to Cosplay As Excalibur from Soul Eater," You must remember that Excalibur always speaks in a more defined tone. He speaks clearly whilst retaining an annoying aura to him. Try to pronounce things with some words missing, but as if you were an English man/lady. But don't miss too many words, otherwise you might sound retarded. Try to skip letters and not words, but don't sound like a pure British. In fact, try to speak like a newscaster, but with no accent and softly so that it annoys others and doesn't simultaneously.;
, You must nearly always retell your legend in the twelfth century. Excalibur always makes this clear to others that this was the year that he was created. Remember to make sure no stories of yours link! Excalibur does this by telling one, for example, 'I always begin my days with a cup of coffee with cream... Nothing beats a cup of herbal tea in the morning... That's why I always start my day with a cup of coffee with cream!!' Remember to make everything sound like you are crazy. Make slight fun of others stupidity and funny outfits. This will surely make you have his confidence and egotistic views. Remember to always act like you are higher than everyone else. Walk with confidence! Who cares what they think?! Remind them that THEY are the odd ones.

, You may need to read the dictionary for this one. Excalibur has been alive for over eight hundred years. Imagine how much he has retained! Even if something doesn't interest you, like a certain subject, learn it quickly and thoroughly so that you can boast about how you were there and make up a story to go with it. Try learning a few words that will make it seem like you definitely ARE higher in intelligence than everyone else.

, Excalibur wears a white top hat, a frilled undershirt, and, for the public, you should wear a shirt bigger than your size, so you can be like him with only a shirt and no pants! Or just get a white tuxedo jacket with the pants too. This will make you look more authentic. Remember to always have a white cane with you. It should be preferred to be just up to your belly button. This way, it an still be light weight and comfy!

, Excalibur only has the finest of ingredients, such as red king crab. This, although expensive, is very unique with sea salt, coriander and a dash of lemon. If it is too expensive for you, just buy salmon and slice it to thin pieces and cook them. It will look like chunks of crab and still taste good! Remember though, don't eat foods you don't like. Although Excalibur tells others not to do something as selfish, he never ate any food he said you still should. A glass of tea, preferably herbal green tea, coffee, with milk and cream, or water will suffice. Remember that only the grandest of toilets will suffice! If you don't have a three story duck toilet, then just settle for your toilet bleached to the whites and looking extravagant.

What genre will your story be?,
Where will your story be set?,
Decide who your main characters are going to be.,
Make a profile for both of the main girls.,
Don't forget secondary characters!,
What problem do your protagonists have to overcome?,
Be sure to pace the romance reasonably.,
Don't make them perfect for each other in every way.",How to Write a Realistic Yuri," Romance, obviously, but romance is hard to do well when it's by itself. Do you want it to be a slice-of-life comedy about two schoolgirls who begin to date? A fantasy story about a princess who falls in love with a female knight? Or a sci-fi about an alien and an earthling falling for each other?;
, High school? The future? The past? A different world completely?

, Obviously, these are going to be the people in love. Who they are depends on the genre and setting of your story. For example, if your story is set in a high school, they can't be a princess and a mermaid.

, List what they look like, how old they are, what they like and dislike, their backgrounds... anything that can help you make them more fleshed-out.

, A popular theme in the yuri genre is to have another, older, wiser lesbian couple who know what your main girls are going through. There are so many possibilities. Maybe one of the main characters is in a love triangle with the other girl and a boy? Maybe one has a supportive best friend?

, How will they do it? You can change your mind later, but be sure to have some idea when you start out.

, Don't have them meet in chapter one and begin going out in chapter 3. (The only exception is if they're both out of the closet and comfortable with dating women.) Have them meet, become friends with some hints of attraction, add some sexual tension... THEN the real attraction can begin.

, This goes for all romances, really. Have them fight. Have them have certain traits that simply clash (a liberal with a conservative, for example). Have them disagree on some things.

Select your Reed.,
Sand the Reed.,
Prepare the reed.,
Soak the reed for a few minutes.,
Store it properly.",How to Prepare a Reed for a Saxophone," There are several manufactures of reeds and several different kinds that can be used. The first kind is the cane reeds. It provides the richest color and tone when used in performance. This reed is the choice of all professional musicians. Synthetic reeds are also available on the market. They may include plastic and synthetic cane reeds. There are many different manufactures with a wide varieties of techniques on how they produce these reeds. It is up to the reader to discover which reeds work best and perform to their specification for each situation.;
, When a reed is purchased it will occasionally come in a rough factory condition. This is not the case for higher quality reeds, which do not require sanding. For a reed to have a good seal and placement on the mouthpiece the table will need to be sanded lightly on fine grain sandpaper to smooth out the rough edges. 400 grit or better sandpaper should suffice. It is a matter of choice to some to smooth the vamp on the reed. This can be done with a smooth motion from the shoulder to tip with paper.

, These more advanced preparations will involve the sanding or trimming of the vamp and tip of the reed. These more advanced preparations can be accomplished using reed rush which is pictured below. All the sanding and trimming done to the vamp will require further reading and are more complex, thus I will leave it out of this basic preparation article. Trimming however may be done to stiffen the reed and can be done a bit more easily than vamp sanding. To trim the tip of a reed you will need a reed trimmer. They can be purchased at any music store.

, This time can depend on the condition of the reed. You will want to avoid letting the reed soak for too long for it will then become water logged. This will negatively affect the performance of the reed. Once the reed is soaked for the proper length of time it can then be placed on the mouthpiece and set for playing.

, It is best to always have at least a few reeds that you can circulate as you play. This will allow for extended life span for the reed. As you play on the other reeds the previously used ones will have a chance to dry. There are many different kinds of reed cases that you can use and this will depends on your level of investment. Reed cases can vary on size and shape, some may only hold one and be made of plastic, however, the better reed cases will hold many and be made of glass. These glass cases are the choice of professionals, allowing a smooth flat surface for the reed to dry on preventing warping.

Wear comfortable clothing that is easy to move in.,
Keep in mind running like Naruto is not the proper way of running, and may cause injury.,
Get into the starting position.,
Bend your torso forward, but try to keep your back straight.,
Hold your arms straight out behind your back.,
Run fast.,
Keep your balance.",How to Run Like Naruto," Try acting like Naruto to get into character, and consider dressing like him if possible.Be sure to wear running shoes. Choose a smooth surface to run along—a space without a lot of obstacles for you to trip over.;
, People usually run with their arms and legs pumping in unison to make each step more powerful. In the Naruto series, characters often have their hands and arms straight out behind them to decrease air resistance. They have been training for years to increase their leg strength, so they do not need the extra power given by thrusting. You can imitate this run, but you won't be able to do it as well as Naruto: a non-existent power (called Chakara in the series) is used to increase their leg strength to make this running style effective. To visually imitate Naruto's ninja run, you just need to lean forward while running and hold your arms straight out behind your torso.

, Step forward with your right foot, position your arms straight out behind you, and slightly bend your knees. Look forward and focus on where you want to run.

, Bend your knees and tilt your whole torso forward. In theory, this gives your enemies a smaller target to notice or hit with ranged weaponry. Keep your head up by bending your neck so you can see where you're running.


Tilt forward about 30 to 40 degrees. Don't lean too far, or you'll run the risk of falling on your face.
Imagine that you're running in a race and you're about to break through the finish line's banner. Your chest and torso should break through the ribbon, not your arms.

, Keep them outstretched as you run, even though it may be hard to do so. Turn your palms so that they are facing up. In theory, this all done to reduce air resistance and help you run faster.Don't swing your arms or move them around. Keep them loose enough that you can focus on your feet, but rigid enough that they don't flop as you run. If you tense up your arms, you will lose concentration.
Try letting your arms lie at their sides and run. If you can hold your arms completely loose and run fast enough, they may just naturally fly out behind you.

, Sprint forward with your arms hanging loosely behind your body. Naruto-style running uses different leg muscles than normal running, so it will probably be hard at first. Keep practicing to get faster. Running this way also takes more stamina than normal running, so don't expect to do it for very long at first.


Start with a slow pace, running slightly normally but leaning your upper body forward. Over time, you can increase your pace and let your arms fly behind you.

, When you run ducking down with your arms behind you, you'll go flying forward with one wrong step. Make sure to balance your weight throughout your whole body. Keep your head up and use your arms to balance yourself as you lean forward. Always look where you're going, and try not to fall.

The red she wears is somewhat dark, so look for darker shades. For the eye makeup, you should can wear lavender eyeshadow and apply black/dark mascara with thin, dark eyeliner. For the face, try to apply a thin layer of usually light colored foundation, and use cover-up for blemishes/scars.;
, (Or, if on a really small budget, just wear a regular headband, preferably a dark blue.) Be sure to wear it covering most (but not all) of your forehead. That's just the style. The ""bangs"" should go over the headband.

, Bangs should be grown out, and parted in the middle. They should also stick up over the headband, and then fall flat. (See photos of Kurenai for reference)

, If you really want to act like her, you also have to keep up with your personal hygiene.

, Wigs should be styled slightly wavy in certain spots, with curls at the ends of strands.

, Athletic tape can work well. Or just you can just wear a really long or tight wrist band if you want to give it that Kurenai touch.

Itachi was a child prodigy and is an incredibly intelligent ninja; if one wishes to emulate his behavior, one must be able to think from an intelligent and analytical perspective.;
, Itachi is lean and trimmed, so one should work on endurance and power (the speed at which one can exert strength) to gain muscle tone and not get bulky.

, Increase your combat skills and ability to deal with dangerous situations more effectively. Itachi uses fighting styles like Judo, kickboxing, and boxing. His strong points are sword fighting, illusions (Itachi uses Sharingan for that, however this eye technique doesn't exist in real life-but there are other ways to manipulate the mind of your opponent) and shuriken accuracy. However, Itachi prefers to use strategy to win a battle.

, Do not hold eye contact with anyone unless you wish to interact with them; just walk past others, as if they were objects with varying velocities. If you sense that you are getting into a conflict with someone, end the interaction quickly and peacefully. Itachi knows when to act and when to stay quiet, so try to emulate his calm nature.

, Avoid wearing baggy pants and clothes with noticeable brand logos. Your outfit as a whole should adhere to an overall theme and should not stand out in vibrancy or design. If you wear glasses or have inadequate eyesight, switch to using contacts. Take care of your image; your hairstyle should be done properly and not detract from your appearance.

, Develop an awareness reflex, which means having a part of your subconscious alert you of when you are unaware of something. This is obviously tricky, but it can be self taught with practice. It's similar to that part of the mind that reminds you to look both ways before crossing the street, or to keep a part of your focus when you are walking on avoiding things that you might trip over. Notice everything around you, any movement, anything.

, Get into the habit of always making a straight face, revealing absolutely no emotion. True calmness reveals little facial expressions other than a straight face. Don't do anything beyond a simple short-lived smile, if you find something very funny.

, Sometimes even walking away can be the best solution; however, be careful on who you turn your back on. Ultimately though, it is always best to avoid the conflict in the first place.

, Naruto headbands are currently available in black, blue, purple, and red, choose a color that fits you best and goes with most of your outfits.

, There are several different ways to do so, you get some inspiration from the characters in the anime/manga, or invent your own unique way to wear it. Here are some suggestions:


As a belt. Just pull the cloth material through the belt loops on your pants and tie in the back. Have the headband centered in front of you.







Around your forehead. Tie it just below your hairline, with the metal piece in front.







Around your neck. Tie the cloth snugly around your neck with the metal plate facing forward. This seems to look best while wearing a hoodie sweatshirt or a jacket.







Like a headband. Tie the cloth behind your ears where your hair and your neck meet. Make sure to part your hair so some is in front of it while the rest is behind it.


Around your leg. Tie the material tight enough so that it does not fall off. (It works well when your sitting, but when you start to move it starts to fall off). Again, place the metal part forward. You can use safety pins to attach it to your pants, but be careful not to stab yourself!


Around your arm. Tie the headband firmly around the top of your left or right arm, just underneath the shoulder.







On your backpack. Tie it around one of the straps, or fasten it to the front of your bag. (This is a great way to wear it to school/work if you live in a country where you have to wear uniform and wouldn't be allowed to wear a headband like this.)

Instead, you can use a temporary or spray dye. It is also an option to purchase a black wig if you don’t feel comfortable changing the color of your hair.Hair dye can be purchased at beauty supply stores, like Sally’s Beauty Supply.
Ask for the advice of a professional if you are unsure how to apply the dye or spray to your hair.;
, Along with black hair, Gray is shown to have medium length, spiky hair. He has bangs that fall across his forehead and across his eye. The rest of his hair is formed into chunky spikes. To get this look, use a strong gel. Run the gel through individual pieces of hair until most or all of your hair is spiky.Use hairspray for added hold.

, Wear color contacts to match Gray's eye color. These can be purchased online, or at a costume store. Make sure the contacts don’t hurt your eyes before wearing them out for the day. You do not have to wear contacts if your eyes are naturally dark blue or a similar color., Though Gray is seen in many outfits, he is often seen wearing a long-sleeved white button-up shirt. Unbutton the shirt so that part of your chest is showing. You don’t have to show your chest, but it's better to unbutton it so people will see your Fairy Tail temporary tattoo.Gray’s character is also known to shed his clothes, so he is often seen shirtless. You can choose not to wear a shirt, but make sure that you abide by dress codes.

, It is also an option to wear a long, white coat with your costume. You can wear this as an added layer to your white button-up, or you can wear this as a way to cover up being shirtless underneath the coat. White trench coats can be bought online, at many stores, or you can look for one at a thrift shop.

Gray Fullbuster jackets can be purchased online.

, Slim fit jeans with front pockets are ideal. Any type of black jeans will do though. Wear a black belt with the jeans.Gray is also seen wearing short, black parachute type pants tucked into boots.

, Most types of black shoes will work for this cosplay. You can wear black sneakers, dress shows, or boots. If you do not own plain, black shoes you can spray paint an old pair that you have, or purchase a pair at a shoe store or thrift shop.

, Gray is shown to have a mark that signifies his place in the Fairy Tail Guild. It is a defining part of his look, so it is important to include this into your cosplay. Purchase a temporary tattoo from a cosplay website, or make one yourself. Place it on the upper right side of your chest.If you can’t find or make a temporary tattoo, you can draw the design on with marker. Make sure anything that you use on your skin does not irritate it.

, Gray is often depicted wearing a silver cross necklace with a sword edge that has a light blue stone in the middle. A necklace like this will be difficult to find in stores, but you can find one on a cosplay apparel website. If you can’t find or purchase the necklace, any silver necklace with a cross will work.The tip of the necklace should end towards the bottom of your sternum.

, In the anime series, Gray’s character is shown with two main weapons. One weapon is a “ice” sword. The other weapon is a “Ice Make” cannon. Choose one prop weapon to carry with you. The cannon is quite large, so the sword may be easier to carry around. If you can’t purchase the props online, it is possible to make them from cardboard, paper mache, and paint.To make the ice sword, cut out a long piece of cardboard with a pointed end. The shape should look like a basic sword. Then, on a separate piece of cardboard or paper draw half of a snowflake and cut it out. Attach it to the sword, about eight inches high onto the cardboard, with glue. Then, paint the sword blue and white.
To make the “Ice Make” cannon, you will need to start with a cardboard tube. Then, cut an octagon with a circle in the middle out of foam. Make one more octagon and put the two together to create a three dimensional shape. Attach this octagon to the end of the tube. Then, cut two circular shapes out of foam and attach them together to make a three dimensional shape. Attach this piece three-quarters of the way at the end of the tube. This is the basic shape of the cannon. Next, use smaller circular tubes to make the “screws.” Once the shape is put together, cover the cannon in papier mache, paint it white and blue, and allow it to dry.

This will give them that ""spiked"" look. Make sure your end result looks like the bristles on a broom. Make it as dry and brittle as possible.

,,, If it has a design on it already, be sure to paint it white, and then paint three purple circles on the fan. Make sure to call these purple circles ""moons"", no matter what they clearly look like. Watch episodes for some examples (eg. episode 43 before Shippuden)

Temari is very intelligent!,
Use a tough attitude.,
The most typical Temari couple is Temari x Shikamaru, but there are many possibilities out there.,
Have a cocky smirk on your face most of the time.,
You should rarely ever be surprised.

,
Think that you are better than most people.

",How to Cosplay As Temari from Naruto2," She is observant and tactful. As seem in the Chuunin exams, she can think her way out of a tough spot.

, Make everyone around you know who's the top dog.

, (For example, she's often shipped romantically with one of her brothers, or both. She's also been paired with Chouji, Sasuke, Sakura, Ino, and many others.) Remember, her personality is rather ambiguous, so it can be assumed that she would fit well with just about anyone.

, Blushing and smiling a lot is very unlike Temari.

Speak like Sasuke.",How to Act Like Sasuke," Sasuke is calm, cold, indifferent, cruel, cynical, a bit sarcastic and somewhat arrogant. In other words, he’s got a cool superiority about him that comes from his confidence and power. If you want to act like Sasuke, you want to exude a sense of that superiority.In general, when people approach you, don't give the time of day, even if it's your best friend, or a romantic interest. They are so much below you in skill and knowledge, you should act like you're bored by their presence.;
, Sasuke has something to prove, and always seems to be dwelling on some inferiority complex. He’s unwilling to acknowledge when someone is stronger than him, and obsesses when it becomes clear that he may be outmatched.


Start cultivating a grim and serious demeanor. Go on long contemplative walks like Sasuke does. Scowl while you do it.
Try to stop laughing at jokes, or at little trifles. Sasuke is deadly serious at all times, making it important that you focus on the gravity of life and the most important things. No time for jokes!

, You are smart, and you know it. Show people that you are smarter than them. Sasuke is hailed as a genius, even by the battle-adept Uchiha clan's standards, excelling at all that he does and finding little difficulty in more challenging tasks. Try to learn everything easily, and be the top on your class.


Study hard, especially the serious subjects like history and literature. Study the great works and commit to being a warrior monk, able to quote poetry at length and do battle in equal measure.

, Sasuke rarely talks, but when he does, he keeps it brief and to the point. Start buttoning up some and you might notice the same thing happen. If you're less likely to talk, when you do choose to speak, make sure it's to the point and serious, and you'll quickly get a reputation as a person to be listened to.


When you do speak, speak clearly and confidently and make pauses between sentences, for more effect. You must not look uncertain when you speak, just say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't stop in the middle or start fading your voice. Confidence shows that whatever you are talking you mean it.

, Difficult challenges, easy tasks, big goals: whatever you've got on your plate, try to do it yourself without asking for help from others. Sasuke views help as a sign of weakness, and wants very much to be seen as a leader, like someone who is to be trusted, and capable. He does not take orders kindly, a sign of his self-reliance.


Don't look to others to validate your pride and your confidence in yourself. Sasuke's favorite word is ""power"" (力, chikara). So, try to gain it, in everything you stumble upon. Find your inner light and your inner strength and use that as your source of confidence, not the opinions of others. Please yourself.
Be sexy. You have a load of self-confidence and you show it. Be yourself and definitely don't flirt with that goofball blonde.

, If Sasuke's resting face is a scowl, the Death Glare is there to let you know when he's getting really intense. It's basically just a scowl with a million percent more intensity. Learning to pull off a great Death Glare is essential to any good Sasuke impression or impersonation.


Tighten your brow and arch your eyebrows dramatically to scowl, then open your eyes and stare with great intensity, as if you're trying to bore a hole through the wall with your sheer power of will.

, Sasuke is typically adorned in dark blue and black clothes, usually loose fitting comfortable garments that allow full range of motions. Ninja clothes, in other words. If you want to get a good Sasuke wardrobe together, a loose fitting blue tunic with a V-neck would be a perfect top, while some baggy pajama-style pants of a dark blue color would pair nicely. A rope belt and headband would complete the look.

, Sasuke has a classic manga hair style, with long emo-like bangs in the front and spiked hair in the back. Grow your hair out a bit, if it's short, to give yourself more to work with, and practice spiking your hair with mousse or hairspray. It'll take a considerable amount of product to get your hair to look like Sasuke's is drawn.


If you want a slightly tamer version, keep your hair short in the back and grow out your bangs, sweeping them to the side of your face. Sometimes called the ""swoop bangs"" or ""emo hair,"" this look is closely linked to the manga look.

, Pale and penetrating, Sasuke's face is like a chunk of ivory. Try to minimize your exposure to the sun and maintain healthy skin with moisturizer, and medicated acne soap, if necessary, to help reduce blemishes.

, Increase your tolerance, endurance and stamina level with aerobic exercise. In a near-blind, battered, and visibly exhausted state from his fight with Danzō, Sasuke still had enough stamina to fight against Kakashi, restrain and disarm Sakura, and later match Naruto's Rasengan with his Chidori. Getting in good fighting shape is essential to a good Sasuke impression.


Yoga, aerobics, strength-training are all excellent ways of getting in shape for a Sasuke vibe. Try to find a Cross-Fit style total-body workout that you can do a few times a week to get into a healthy weight and improve your stamina. These workouts combine strength training and aerobic exercise, helping to build muscle, burn fat, and improve your cardiovascular health.

, Really want to take your Sasuke to the next level? Learn some Japanese. Even learning a few phrases of Sasuke's language will set you above other impersonators and cosplayers, as well as open up whole new ways of experiencing Naruto. Who knows what might happen if you become fluent!

, Learning to defend yourself with martial arts will help you become more disciplined, centered, and in touch with your body. The martial arts have much less to do with fighting and more to do with learning about kinetic motion, movement, and fluidity. Whether you want to study karate, ninjitsu, or tae-kwon-do, getting a fundamental study of martial arts under your belt will help you become more like Sasuke.


The seriousness and meditativeness of martial arts may also center you and improve your impression of Sasuke from an attitude perspective.

, Sasuke is an expert swordsman, lethal and versatile, possessing powerful strikes with equally impressive speed and precision behind them. Learning to use a sword and studying the art of moving with a blade can be a powerful experience and form to study.


Swordsmanship is a skill that requires lifelong practice and dedication. You're not going to pick it up in an afternoon, and playing around with sharp swords is a good way to injure yourself seriously. Study swords in a professional environment, and never use a sharp sword if you don't know what you're doing.

, While it's somewhat difficult to become purely ambidextrous, if you weren't born that way, you can improve your ability to use both hands and both feet with lots of practice. Practice being physical and versatile on your dominant as well as your weak side. Although he leads with his right, Sasuke uses his Chidori with his left, making him unpredictable. Practice writing with both hands, seeing if you can get your ""weak"" hand as strong and as clear as your ""strong"" hand.

, Sasuke is often seen 'eating healthy.' Sasuke's favorite food are Rice Balls, Skip-jack Tuna and Tomatoes, while his least favorites are Soybeans and anything sweet. If you've got a sweet-tooth, try curbing it in favor of lighter fare. Snack on some carrot sticks instead of candy, or try out some sushi for dinner instead of eating that burger. Think light.

, Learning some good Sasuke quotations and one-liners is a good way of making sure everyone knows who you're supposed to be. Lower your voice, don your Death Glare, and speak one of the following lines:


""My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I hate a lot of things, and I don't particularly like anything. What I have is not a dream, because I will make it a reality. I'm going to restore my clan, and destroy a certain someone.""
""If you think I'm just a foolish kid ruled by his emotions, that's fine. Following Itachi's path would be childish, the whispering of fools who don't know hatred. If anyone else tries to ridicule the way I live, I'll slaughter everyone they ever cared about. And then maybe they'll understand what it's like to taste… a little of my hatred.""
“There is no question that you are special... unfortunately you're not quite as special as I am!""
""With my hatred ... I'll turn the illusion into reality!""
""I am on a path the rest of you can't follow... ""
""I have long since closed my eyes... My only goal is in the darkness.""

Measure the height/width of your face carefully.,
Blow up your balloon to as close to your face size as possible.,
Take a Sharpie (or other not-fat permanent marker) and map out your face on the balloon (you might need a mirror to do so).,
Cut your plaster fabric into strips about an inch and a half to 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, but not longer than your face measurements.,
Wet your strips, don't soak them, and lay them over the balloon.,
When your mask is as thick as you like (make sure its pretty thick), let it dry for at a minimum of an hour.

,
If your mask is mildly wet to damp, its safe to pick-up as long as it looks ""sturdy"".,
Set your mask outside in a protected area to fully dry.,
if your mask is 100% dry, then it's time to sand it.,
Now take a pencil and lightly sketch the mask's swirls.,
Now it's time to paint!,
Take your Velcro strap (or whatever you're using, and Crazy Glue one side to the inside of the mask.",How to Make a Tobi Mask (Naruto)," Measure from the top of your forehead to the bottom of your chin and from cheekbone to cheekbone. Remember not to pull so hard on the tape measure and squish your face. You need the mask to be somewhat comfortable to wear.;
, If the balloon isn't proportioned for your face, then blow-up the balloon to at least the height of your head.

, Also make sure you take extra care in making sure you sketch the shape of your right eye. Also, draw the boundaries of your face, just in case.

, Remember: the mask only covers the face, not half of your head! Also, if you want a sturdy mask, but not want to use the entire roll of plaster? don't cut all the roll into strips (common sense).

, You don't need a specific pattern, but try not to glob a bunch of them together or your mask will be lumpy. Also, bear-in-mind the size of Tobi's eye hole. His eye hole is very very tiny. If you don't want your eye hole that small, then don't make it that small.

,, Place the mask on your face to make sure it's a fine fit. If it fits around the face funny, VERY carefully, mold the mask to your face.

, this may take up to 3 days depending on how thick u made your mask. Just keep checking on it if you plan on leaving it out for an extended period of time. bring it inside at night.

, Use a power sander at a low power to buff-out any minor bumps and smooth the edges. Or you can use regular sandpaper. make sure to use a low-number grit.

, When you get it as you want it, take a sharpie (or any other very dark fine-pointed permanent marker) and carefully outline the swirls.

, I started with a dark yellow Tempera base, let it dry, re-outlined the swirls with a sharpie, and then put on an orange acrylic paint coat. Then i took a thin paintbrush and dark brown acrylic paint and re-outlined the swirls. There are many methods to painting the mask. Painting is art and therefore are not rules. Make sure to let it fully dry before applying more coats. But always make sure to use some kind of finish on it. I accidentally used a gloss finish, but i would recommend a Satin finish because pictures of your mask might come out weird, like mine do.

, The further in you glue it, the more supportive it will be, but make sure you have enough to measure around your head. Then when the one side is absolutely dry, put the mask on your face and adjust the other side of the mask. Make sure the mask fits snug; Not too loose, but not too tight. Glue the other side as well. Let that sit and dry.

If you need to look like Shino for a long period of time, you can use permanent dye that will last until your hair grows out.
If you only need to look like Shino for a few days, temporary henna hair dye will do the trick.
If you really don’t want to dye your hair, you can use a wig, but it may not look as natural.;
, Wash and dry your hair and comb out any tangles. Squeeze a quarter size amount of hair glue in your palm, rub it between your hands and work it into your hair. Starting at the base, use your thumb and forefinger to create spikes that stand straight up. Repeat the process with the rest of your hair.When you’ve finished spiking your hair, Spray a copious amount of hair spray all around it to ensure your spikes stay up.


If your air is curly or wavy, you may need to use a hair straightener before creating spikes.
Use hair glue designed to hold hair straight up. If you use hair gel, your spikes may fall.

, Draw the leaf village symbol on a piece of metallic paper with a sharpie. Cut the metallic paper into a rectangle with an x-acto knife and smooth out the edges. Cut a long thick strand of black fabric for your band. Fold the fabric and sew the edges together. Leave one end of the fabric unsewn and pull the band inside out through it. Sew the remaining end of the fabric together and superglue the metallic paper to the center of your headband. After the super glue dries, wrap the headband around your head.

If you can, find glasses with circular lenses like Shino’s.

, Cut them around eight inches shorter than your leg. Get some white tape and wrap it around your right thigh. Then get some black tape and wrap it around the same thigh on top of the white tape.

Brown sweatpants may work best. Shino battles often and needs pants that allow him to be as mobile as possible.

, You can order these from a cosplay site like cosplayfu.com or you can make your own. Use scissors to cut the tops off of an old pair of sneakers leaving only the soles and the back of the shoes. Put on a pair of blue knee-high socks and make a mark on them at the top of your index toe. Take of the socks. Cut them at your mark and pull them over the shoes. Slide your feet into your newly designed shoes. Your toes should be exposed., Shino is a master strategist. He often uses false attacks to plant bugs on his opponents that slowly drain their chakra. (life energy) Educate yourself in combat strategy the way Shino does to gain the edge on his opponents.


Smoke out your enemies and inwardly declare war so that you can strike without warning.
Focus your mind on the present moment. Learn to detach yourself from chaos to make rational decisions.
Learn to read your opponent. Pay attention to your enemy’s behavior., Shino’s favorite hobby is insect watching. Observe the actions of various bugs and study them as much as you can.

Spiders tend to flee away from the heavy streams of air from a hair dryer.

, Shino keeps his emotions hidden, making it difficult for his enemies to read his intentions. Practice hiding your emotions. Be sure to watch out for body language that could betray the way you feel.Uncross your arms and don't clench your neck when you're feel defensive.
Relax your stare and loosen your fists when you feel anger.

, When Naruto returns to the village after three year, he doesn’t recognize Shino. Shino holds a grudge against him for the rest of the series. Don’t let anything go, at least while you’re Shino Aburame., If people ask you questions, respond with short answers. For example, if someone asks you what you do for a living, respond with a simple “I’m a businessman,” or whatever it is that you do. Don’t give any further details.Don’t feel any need to explain yourself. Let people wonder about you.

, When Shino does talk, he says exactly what he means. Don’t sugarcoat the truth. For example, if someone asks you if you like their cosplay outfit, say either “yes I do,” or “no I don’t.” .


Make sure people know you’re speaking in character so they don’t think you’re a jerk.

, When daily nuisances arise, don’t get worked up. Instead, focus on ways to solve them.


If you stub your toe on a couch while your getting ready, don’t get mad and kick the couch. Rather, rearrange the furniture so the room is less cluttered reducing the chance of you stubbing your toe again.
If you have a flat tire on the way to a cosplay convention, don’t waste time cursing and being upset. Calmly, replace the tire with your spare and carefully drive to the nearest automotive shop.

, When you do talk to someone, stutter a lot. Play with your fingers when you're scared or nervous about something. Act nervous when you talk to your crush.

Eventually as time passes, you will start reacting calmly to those situations.

, Choose a spot and try to keep your eyes focused there without looking around. This can improve concentration. Do puzzles to get your mind going. Also working on your imagination.

Have some silly obsession that characterizes you.",How to Be Like Naruto Uzumaki," Knock out all that negative vibe on your heart, kick vengeance out and scratch away all that hatred. Naruto proved that his heart was pure from all that when he fought off Dark-Naruto, remember? You should do the same. Always find a reason to be happy. Set goals that you want to achieve in the future and don't let obstacles stop it, Naruto always wanted to become Hokage and didn't let small fights get to him, he always got up and kept going.;
, Don’t ever give up! Life is wired to scare us and turn us pessimistic but, you’ve got to push through with the right attitude. Naruto wasn’t so optimistic from the start; he scared the life out of himself when faced with Zabuza for the first time, he wanted to run away but, he didn’t. He faced the challenge and took the horse by its reins. Don’t back down when challenges look you dead in the eye.

, Always try to attract people’s attention in whatever petty thing you do. Not only will this push you out of your comfort zone but also give you a motivation to perfect whatever you’re doing. Always try to juice-out praise; it can give you a boost of self-esteem!

, It can be anything from academics to breaking a habit. Always remind yourself of what you’re working towards.

, Remember how much Naruto used to hate Sasuke because he was so popular? However, towards the end, he found a common ground with Sasuke and the two became quite close. Don’t think you’re ego’s going to be hurt if you talk to that girl/boy who sits at the back of the class –they’re human too! Treat everyone the same and keep those who you’ve got a lot in common with close to heart.

, The whole plot of Shippuden surrounds Naruto trying to bring Sasuke back or, at least, erase that sense of revenge from his heart because it’s wrong. Once you love someone, love them unconditionally and dearly and don’t be afraid to go all the way for them.

, Never stop smiling, even if you’re having a bad day. Smiling brings a light of hope and joy to the people around you, regardless of the situation’s intensity. Always be the one to light the dark path.

, These literally define Naruto. Let your voice be heard and refuse to feel lower than anyone. Call yourself the best and Believe it!

, Study hard, take extra classes or whatever you need to ace academics –if that’s your goal. Practice as much as possible, train your body and mind and eat right if becoming the world’s greatest athlete is your goal. Whatever it may be, don’t stop till you’ve reached/become what you’ve dreamed.

, Once you make a promise –Never go back on it! Learn to keep secrets and be trustworthy.

, Naruto never needed too many words to make friends and he didn’t use too much word to show how much he cared about Sasuke, Sakura and the village as a whole. Let your actions speak for you. People will admire you for that.

, This shows your individuality and fun-ness. Naruto is obsessed with ramen. What are you obsessed with? These will give you a random topic to discuss about when you’re bored –just make sure you’re not over doing it or the other person can become annoyed.

Play pranks on others.,
Move quickly and rush through things.,
Make friends out of your rivals.,
Work hard at academics and fitness.,
Eat ramen noodles.",How to Act Like Naruto1," Try playing lighthearted pranks on other people, like prank calls or practical jokes, to mimic Naruto’s trickster side.


A good Naruto-style prank is anything that catches someone else by surprise. The character Kakashi calls Naruto the ""number one ninja in surprising people.""Make sure you don’t do anything harmful to another person, or hurt feelings with a prank. Even Naruto matures and grows out of being a prankster later in the series, acknowledging that he was simply looking for attention.;
, Adopt Naruto’s hyperactive personality by running and generally moving very quickly from place to place and activity to activity.


Try Naruto’s typical running style by tilting your head and upper body forward and putting your arms straight back behind your body to run forward.
You can also try out some of Naruto’s ninja moves. It’s best to learn proper grappling moves from a certified martial arts instructor, just like Naruto goes to an academy to learn his ninja moves.

, Be friendly to others and recognize that rivals or enemies can become your friends if you find something in common with them.


For example, Naruto’s best friend Sasuke Uchiha was also his childhood rival. Naruto eventually recognizes similarities between them, like the feeling of being alone, which brought them together.Make friends with all different kinds of people. Even though Naruto can be stubborn and play pranks, he is also cheerful, kind, and accepting of lots of different people.

, Try your best at whatever you do, whether it’s school work, a hobby, or a sport. Be determined and don’t let negative criticism or personal shortcomings get in the way of you reaching your goals.


Naruto has a hard time grasping basic concepts and is not a star academically, but he always works hard and doesn’t give up on his goals, which is a quality you can emulate no matter your skill level in any activity.
Inspire others with your hard work and resolve to achieve tasks and goals. Naruto’s determination often inspired other characters in the manga and anime, like Konohamaru and Inari, to not give up and to succeed., Try Naruto’s favorite food, ramen, which he is shown eating all the time in the manga and anime.


In the U.S., you can buy packaged ramen noodles with flavoring to prepare at home. You might also try ramen from a Japanese restaurant or prepared in a more traditional way with multiple vegetables, meat, and flavoring."

Find an outfit.,
Change your hair.,
Find something to resemble Gaara's gourd.,
Add makeup.,
Imitate Gaara's voice.,
Be calm and clever.,
Don't smile.,
Be monosyllabic.",How to Cosplay As Gaara of the Desert," You can either make a costume, or simply order one online.


For Gaara's shoes, you can simply buy some cheap black sandals or cover your own sandals with black duct tape.;
, You are either going to have to cut your hair, or get a wig. You probably already know that his hair is short, reddish brown, and spiky. If you want to get a wig, you definitely will be able to find one in any good cosplay website. If your hair is already short, you can put in some temporary hair dye and spike it up with some hair gel.


If you dye your hair red for cosplay, just be careful. Some schools don't allow dyed hair or the hair might not be appropriate for work. Use temporary dye where possible.

, Gaara's gourd is a difficult object to find. Many people have trouble with this. Again, you can make one, or buy one. You will probably want to make one, because all the one's online will be low-quality and not the right size.


Try carrying a bit of sand. Obviously, you're not going to walk around in front of your friends and family with that enormous gourd, so just carry a little bag of sand instead.

, Gaara is known to have very dark circles around his eyes due to insomnia, so you will have to put dark, thick eyeliner around your eyes. Finish it off with a red kanji symbol for love on your upper left forehead. This can be put on with paint, or just red eyeliner.


Make a tattoo like the one Gaara has on his forehead. The meaning of that is ""Love"" or ""Ai"" (which is ""love in Japanese""; it is written as: 愛 or あい. Ga-a-ra: があら or 我愛羅. (I love Asura, the self loving/narcissistic Asura). 羅 (ら) Ra is the Asian language adaptation of the Indian word Asura, the deity of warfare and bloodshed. Use a temporary tattoo or just draw it in with a sharpie.

, Gaara has a mean but soft voice. His voice is sort of like when you have a sore throat, so try pretending you have a sore throat and practice talking like him.

, Gaara is always calm. Be clever always. Thinking about your answers before you say them may make you seem smarter, if you know what you're saying.

, If you need to laugh about something, just smirk. Gaara doesn't laugh, as that is showing too much emotion, so a tiny smirk will do the trick. It may be hard, but it'll ruin your toughness if you smile!


Never show your emotions too much. Gaara in the series never shows emotion, except for when he remembers his mother. So try not to show any emotion.

, Gaara is cold and indifferent towards people. Try to reply to people with short one word answers. Reveal very little.

Use the catchphrase ”Dattebayo.” Try out Naruto’s catchphrase, which he says frequently throughout the TV show.,
Assert your determination and achievement.,
Say “I want to become Hokage.” Adopt another popular catchphrase of Naruto’s, “I want to become Hokage,” which reflects his ultimate goal of becoming the leader of his village, Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf).",How to Act Like Naruto2,"


”Dattebayo” doesn’t translate to any sensical phrase in Japanese or English, but it’s generally taken to be an emphasis on his speech that also portrays a childish, mischievous quality.In early episodes of the English dubbed version of the anime, the catch phrase is translated to “Believe it!” to approximate the meaning and match the lip movements of the animation.

, Use phrases that Naruto would say to back up his beliefs, like, “I will never give up” and “This is my ninja way.”You don’t need to say things that aren’t true or that come across as arrogant; these confident phrases are just meant to emphasize determined behavior, hard work, and striving for success.

,


You can also try another common Naruto phrase, “I will make everyone recognize me.” This similarly emphasizes the desire to become Hokage because that position will make Naruto respected and admired by the people of his village.

Naruto has blue and white at the top of his jacket and a white and blue band around the right leg of his pants in many illustrations and animations.You may also be able to find a premade Naruto costume at a costume shop or party store.

, Buy or make your own headband to look like the one Naruto wears, which features a spiral design on a piece of metal.Uzumaki, Naruto’s last name, translates to “spiral.” The symbol that appears on headbands and to represent the Konoha village uses this spiral shape as part of the design., Then draw on his “whisker” marks on your cheeks.

Pick your subject.,
Pick your song.,
Get the video components.,
Make a file for your AMV.,
Start adding stuff!,
Edit edit edit!,
Watch your AMV over and over.,
Upload!,
Finish up.",How to Make an Anime Music Video," First off, you have to pick a fandom that you'll be doing the AMV for. Your AMV subject could be one of several things. You could choose to focus on a particular character (Character AMV), a pairing (Shipping AMV), a group of characters (Multiple-Character AMV), the entire anime (perhaps pride for that fandom or a particular theme?), or you could get creative and do a crossover AMV featuring characters from more than one anime. Whatever you want! The choice is yours. However, you'll probably want to chose a fandom, character, or pairing that you are familiar with and is popular enough to be noticed by others in the fandom.;
, A good AMV uses a song that fits closely with the subject and describes it almost perfectly, Otherwise the video itself will have to be put together in such a way that IT fits the song. If someone can react by saying ""wow! This song is practically his/her/their/its theme song!"", then you have chosen a song well. Sometimes, you might simply be listening to or thinking about a particular song, and suddenly have a Eureka moment in which you realize that that song would be perfect for a particular fandom/pairing/character. Use your judgement. Once you have your song, it would help to listen to that song on repeat (consider listenonrepeat . com) for long periods of time. This will help inspire you and give you ideas for what you want to do for the AMV.

, This includes the song's audio and the images/clips. Look up a good website or program that can (legally!) allow you to download the audio for the song you plan to use. You will want to do the same for episodes of the anime, if you plan to use actual video clips from the anime itself. Besides video clips, you can also use still images for the AMV, such as screenshots of episodes, portions of the manga (if the anime has one, which most animes do), fanart, official designs, or, if given permission, screenshots of others' AMVs. Save these all to your computer in a place where you will be able to access them later.

, Again, you will have to decide for yourself what you want to do here. Find a program on which you can make and edit slideshows and videos. Create a file on that program and title it whatever you plan to name your AMV.

, This is where you add the song audio and video clips and/or images that you plan to use. Pick images/clips that you feel fit the theme and subject of the AMV, as well as those that match the lyrics and mood of the song. Again: use your judgement. You should have figured out by now what effect you are trying to go for, and should select images and clips accordingly.

, This might be the hardest step. This is where that skill and patience and practice comes in. Now, you should edit the duration and order of the different images/clips you have selected to correspond with the effect you're trying to go for. Timing is everything. A good AMV will have images corresponding well with the song. A great AMV will have good timing and correspond the images with the lyrics and rhythm of the song. That takes practice. Your first AMV will probably be poorly put-together. But your following AMVs will get better and better. This step is also where you put in transitions and motions and all that stuff to make your video fun and enjoyable and nice to watch.

, When you feel like everything is the way you want it to be, watch your AMV all the way through several times, without editing it. Do this several times. Chances are that you're going to notice a few things that you don't like, something you want to change, something you forgot to include, or something that needs to be fixed. Take note of these things, then when you've watched it all the way to the end, go back and fix those things. Every time you fix the AMV, watch it again at least two more times to see if anything else needs fixing. Repeat as often as necessary. When you've watched it all the way through about five or more times in a row without changing anything, then it's time to....

, Now that you're satisfied with your AMV, you can upload it. YouTube is probably the best option. But if there is another site that you like to upload videos to, then go right ahead. The uploading processes vary from site to site and from program to program, so read up on how uploading works for your site and program of choice.

, This last step varies slightly from site to site. But it's mostly the same: choosing a title, editing tags and the description. One thing to be sure to include in your video description are credits and disclaimers. If you used artwork that isn't yours, say so and give credit to artists that want to be credited. Include the name and artist of the song.

Think about all the characters you've already watched in an anime or TV show and decide which ones have your favorite costume designs.,
If you're going to an event or con, hit the forums and see what groups will be there.,
Once you've got some ideas, discuss them with friends or fellow cosplayers--they will always be willing to lend you a hand!,
Assuming you have maybe three ideas left, look at the realistic possibilities of you making the costume.,
When budgeting, make sure you take into account all the bits and pieces including fabrics, wastes and mishaps, accessories, hard materials like polymer clay and board for props, makeup, wigs and hair products, and shoes.,
Now you're ready to actually make your costume (hopefully a month or two in advance of the event!,
Once you're confident you have the right character choice you can have some fun whilst making the costume!",How to Pick an Anime Character to Cosplay," Have a good soul-search and see if you come up with initial ideas.;
, That way, if you're nervous, then you can join a group. (It'll also be good to meet the other cosplayers anyway for advice and counsel.)

, Choosing a character with a costume and look that would be flattering to you is a good idea, since we don't all have stick thin waists and busts like anime characters! Think about how you would feel wearing the costumes and narrow your list. If any of the costumes might make you feel uncomfortable then it's pointless to go through the hassle of making it. You want to be comfortable come convention time!

, Things to consider are your skill level (everyone has to start somewhere, so if you've only just learnt how to use a sewing machine then choose something you will be able to get a pattern for. But if you're a seasoned pro you can probably make your own patterns from scratch.), and budget. If you're on a tight budget you can source cheap fabrics on the internet or at local fabric stores but beware that thin or cheap looking fabrics will show up on cameras and to other more experienced cosplayers. If you don't mind saying happily ""Oh no, I just did this cheaply"" then that's fine! If you don't want to enter competitions and you have the money then you can also get your chosen costume custom made for you. Price up how much your costume will cost to buy or make and pick the one that fits your budget and skills best.

, If you think you can handle it all with both timescale and budget then I'd say you've got your costume choice.

,), take some time to make sure you nail every detail. Other cosplayers will definitely appreciate your fine eye! If you can't manage all the details or can't manage to buy clothing store-bought and alter it, you can always take your own design choices. Ask other cosplaying communities for their support and advice.

, Try acting in character, and try posing in front of the mirror as you would do for photographs in character. If your character is serious and pensive then a big daft grin won't display your character very well! Also take in mind the props and limitations of the costume so you don't come up with grand poses which you can't actually do. If you intend on taking part in a masquerade, take steps to ensure you can walk in your costume! (Some characters have costumes that like to defy gravity and would fall off any normal person and we can't have your costume falling apart around you!)

Research the cons that are around where you live


The first thing you need to do is find one near you that you could go to.,
Ask your parents if you can go.

,
Register for it!,
Hotel booking


If you are going with a group of friends and are all chipping in to help pay for the room, make sure it’s fairly distributed among everyone.,
Figure out your transportation


This is another important thing to do before going.,
Create a budget


A budget is always important no matter where you go.,
Get your luggage together


It is usually a good idea that the night or a few nights before the convention you pack all the bags you plan to take with you.,
Make a cosplay outfit to wear at the convention.",How to Prepare For an Anime Convention," Newcomers should find a small one to go to first and not a huge one such as AnimeExpo in California, (this is the largest one held in the United States). You can check out www.animecons.com if you are having troubles with your research. Make sure the con you choose though is NOT occurring in less than four months time because if you need to stay at a hotel while attending, the hotels in the area may already be booked solid.





;
,,


Most cons allow you to be able to register ahead of time. Most conventions have their own website and a link to follow so you can get your advance tickets , so you are not one of the unfortunate people who have to wait for hours on end waiting in line. The lines for the pre-registered are usually shorter, faster and are cheaper than buying tickets at the door. Sometimes there are special bonuses that you receive if you pre-register, which is definitely a plus.







, If someone tries to get out of paying tell them, “You don’t pay, you don’t stay!” Figure out which people will stay in which room and make sure that everyone in each room get along and won’t try to kill each other during the night.







, Find out a way to get there. A parent or someone who is going with you can drive everyone there. If the con is quite far you might need to take a train or Greyhound bus. If it seems too far to use any of these then you might have to consider taking an airplane there.







, You need to remember to specify a certain amount for your hotel room, food and drinks (make sure to drink lots of water and stay hydrated), transportation, registration fees, and anything you plan on buying either in the dealer’s room or artist alley. Making a list of the things you are hoping to find is very useful too. This way you know the main things you want to buy and you can then try to budget a bit extra for the other things you come across and this way you don’t forget about something you have been meaning to get for a while.







, THREE bags are suggested.






One of these will be the bag you carry with you at all times during the con. This bag will hold a change of clothes, an optional cosplay repair kit(scissors, glue, needle and thread, some extra material and anything else you think you might need if something happens to your costume), camera, puzzle books or something to do if you have to wait in long lines, a couple bottles of water, and some snacks such as chips. Also put some medication for headaches, nausea, etc just in case you or someone becomes ill. You’ll be thankful you had it. Be sure to put any of your prescriptions in here too. Bandaids are good to have as well. Do NOT put your wallet, cell phone, iPod, money or your What to Look for List in this bag. Put valuables in your front pockets at all times to avoid theft. If you have your cosplay outfit on and it doesn’t have pockets either ask a friend to hold onto these or hide the items really well in the bag you are carrying. No convention will be held responsible for theft if you lose these; it will be your own fault.






The second bag should be a bit bigger and will be used for your clothing/toiletries bag. If the convention lasts for three days bring (depending on the season) a couple T-shirts or tanks, a sweater, a jacket, shorts, pants, pajamas, enough underwear and socks, and shoes that will be comfortable. Also, put some kind of plastic bag in here so that you can separate your dirty clothes from your clean clothes. If you choose to make a cosplay outfit you can put it in here or leave it separate from everything (it’s up to you). Put a small bag of toiletries in here which should have, deodorant, shampoo/conditioner, hairbrush, toothpaste/toothbrush, and girls can put their make - up and hair accessories in there own.
Your third and final bag will be your purchases bag. This won’t be filled at the beginning , but it should be at the end of the con. This will hold everything you will buy at the con such as books, DVD’s, figurines, etc. For the time being though you can place this somewhere in your second bag.


Put tags on all of your bags that with your important information such as name, address and phone number.







,


At anime conventions there are those who choose to make/buy a costume to wear during the con. These costumes tend to be modelled after an anime or manga character. Some people have worked really hard to make themselves look perfect for the con. These things take time to create; don’t wait until the last possible minute to make it. Plan your time accordingly. If the character that you choose has a weapon of some sort don’t bring in a real thing, such as a gun. YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE. Be smart and make the weapon out of something like cardboard or some other materials that will not be seen as dangerous. If your weapon appears dangerous in any way you will be asked to sign it in. Finally, if you feel confident in the outfit you made/bought you can always enter yourself into a masquerade that normally occurs at most conventions.
